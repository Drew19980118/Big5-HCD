1,"DE: Hello, nice to meet you.
DD: Hello! Nice to meet you!
DE: What did you have for lunch?
DD: I haven't had lunch yet. I had a late breakfast. What did you have?
DE: I had deli bread and supermarket takoyaki.
DD: Can you specify what kind of savory bread it is?
DE: It was a roll with cutlet and cabbage inside. It was delicious.
DD: That sounds delicious! Maybe I will have some bread too.
DE: Do you like bread? What kind of bread do you want to eat?
DD: I like bread. Recently, I've been enjoying the loaf bread from a nearby bakery.
DE: It's delicious, isn't it? What kind of bread is it?
DD: It's made with high-quality ingredients, so it's sweet and delicious on its own.
DE: I've noticed many specialty bread shops opening recently.
DD: Yes, they have been increasing in number.
DE: I see stores with long lines that sell out quickly, but I avoid them because I don't like waiting in line.
DD: I don't buy things if I have to wait in line either. I wouldn't wait in line for ramen.
DE: Ramen shops often have lines. It's said the competition in that area is high.
DD: Do you like ramen?
DE: I didn't like it much before, but my husband got me into it. How about you?
DD: I don't feel strongly about ramen, but I'll try it as my food preferences have been changing.
DE: How about somen or soba?
DD: I prefer udon over soba, but ramen is my least favorite noodle dish.
DE: Udon is delicious. I like Sanuki udon.
DD: Sanuki udon is delicious. It might be a good idea for lunch too.
DE: Bread or udon? I guess it’s wheat flour. Haha.
DD: Maybe too much flour! I'll have rice for dinner.
DE: Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to live without wheat flour.
DD: I tried going gluten-free due to family influence, and it was tough.
DE: That’s impressive. What made it difficult?
DD: Finding food without wheat is hard, expensive, and requires a lot of cooking."
2,"DE: Hello. Nice to meet you!
DD: Hello. How can I assist you today?
DE: Is your family home nearby?
DD: I live with my parents.
DE: That's good to know. It takes me half a day to visit my hometown since it's far away.
DD: Understood. It seems you may wish you could visit more easily sometimes.
DE: Yes, I have friends from Kanto who feel the same way.
DD: Noted. Visiting home, short trips, and exchanging things can be enjoyable activities.
DE: Indeed. Choosing souvenirs can be challenging.
DD: What kind of items do you think would make your family happy?
DE: It depends on the person, but my parents usually prefer things other than sweets.
DD: I understand. Are your parents not fond of sweets?
DE: Correct. They have a discerning palate, so I'm cautious about what I buy. Haha.
DD: That requires some effort and planning. Haha.
DE: Do you buy souvenirs for your family on your way back from work?
DD: Yes. My family enjoys sweets, so I often buy those.
DE: What sweets have you eaten recently?
DD: I had ohagi from a Japanese sweets shop.
DE: I also enjoy wagashi. Ohagi has become quite stylish and tasty recently.
DD: Agreed. They are visually appealing but have a short shelf life, so I can only buy a few.
DE: True. I used to eat seasonal Japanese sweets when I was learning tea ceremony.
DD: Learning the tea ceremony sounds wonderful. Traditional sweets are charming.
DE: It has a unique elegance across the seasons, which I love.
DD: That sounds delightful. It makes me want to drink matcha.
DE: I had matcha recently at a local Japanese-style cafe that serves wagashi.
DD: That sounds like a nice place. Do you visit often?
DE: Yes, about once a week. It's a casual place.
DD: It seems you are a regular visitor.
DE: Yes, the store is run by an acquaintance.
DD: That makes visiting easier and more enjoyable. Thank you for sharing."
