        Now, I will give you a Human Human Dialogue. The content is as follows:
        ## Human Human Dialogue:

        ## Personality traits score & Personality traits description:  
        {personality_traits}
        Then, I will give you a Human Computer Dialogue based on this Human Human Dialogue, where DM simulates the role of a Human (converting DM's utterances in the original Human Human Dialogue), and BP simulates the role of a Computer (converting BP's utterances in the original Human Human Dialogue). In this simulation, only the style of each utterance will be changed without altering its content and meaning.
        ## Human Computer Dialogue:
        {human_computer_dialogue}
        The conversion of this Human Human Dialogue into Human Computer Dialogue is based on the following Additional Knowledge:
        ## Additional Knowledge
        {additional_knowledge}
        Now, I have received several different evaluatorsâ€™ feedback regarding the issues with this transformed Human Computer Dialogue:
        {human_feedback}

        Your task is to revise this Human Computer Dialogue based on the feedback (you may need to refer to the original Human Human Dialogue, Personality traits score & Personality Traits Description and Additional Knowledge) and output a completely new Human Computer Dialogue. The output format should remain consistent with the original Human Computer Dialogue.

        **Important!!!** The newly generated Human Computer Dialogue must consider the content of each feedback simultaneously. Your response should only include the newly generated Human Computer Dialogue and no additional titles or information.

    BP: I see. My family gathered on the 13th because my parents' house is in the city. 
    DM: Does it feel like we gathered for the first time in a while? 
    BP: That's right. It's been a while since we got together. Out of the four siblings, three of them came with their kids. 
    DM: That's wonderful. Everyone seems to get along well. 
    BP: Yes, thanks to you, my family and siblings get along well.

    BP: "That's right. This summer is hectic." 
    DM: "Is your child not showing any signs of being nervous yet?" 
    BP: Yes, sometimes they say "I'm nervous!" but it seems like they haven't really felt it yet. 
    DM: I caused a lot of trouble for my parents during my exam period, haha. 
    BP: Everyone goes through times like that, don't they? I feel like I was also irritable for some reason. 
    DM: I appreciate your understanding. 
    BP: My children also get irritated sometimes. They want to be alone. 
    DM: "It might be common to want to be alone." 
    BP: Yes! In a lecture for parents on how to deal with adolescence, we were told that parents just have to be prepared to be completely worn out. 
    DM: So there is such a lecture, huh. Is it held at the school? 
    BP: I received a flyer from the school and attended a lecture hosted by the city. 
    DM: I think it is admirable how much you care for your child. 
    BP: No, no, I went through the same path myself, so I thought I should be prepared.

    DM: "Is it on YouTube? I didn't know there were such videos!" 
    BP: That's right. There are many analysis drama series and historical drama series that come up when you search for them.

    BP: That's right. During the previous season, I was watching analysis videos of My Family.

    additional_knowledge = """
    Differences Between Human Human Dialogue (HHD) and Human Computer Dialogue (HCD):

    Communication Styles:

    HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are characterized by brief, frequent exchanges that prioritize efficiency. Users expect clear, straightforward responses without unnecessary elaboration.
    Example: User: "What time is my next meeting?" System: "Your meeting starts at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B."

    HHD: Conversations between humans are more nuanced and context-rich, often incorporating additional details, shared thoughts, or collaborative reasoning.
    Example: Person A: "The weather app says itâ€™ll stay clear, but the sky looks a bit hazy. Do you think we should leave earlier for the hike?" Person B: "Good pointâ€”maybe we can avoid the afternoon crowd too. Letâ€™s aim for 8 AM instead!"

    Relational and Personality Expression:

    HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are transactional and lack emotional depth or personal connection, as machines are incapable of genuine empathy or emotional understanding.
    Example: User: "Iâ€™m overwhelmed with work deadlines." System: "Would you like me to schedule a reminder for your tasks?"

    HHD: Human interactions are infused with emotional expression, humor, and openness, fostering trust and mutual understanding. These exchanges often include empathy, support, and shared problem-solving.
    Example: Person A: "Iâ€™ve been swamped with deadlines all weekâ€”itâ€™s exhausting." Person B: "That sounds rough. Want to grab coffee later? We can brainstorm ways to tackle it together."
