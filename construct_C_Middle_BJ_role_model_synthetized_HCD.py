        Now, I will give you a Human Human Dialogue. The content is as follows:

        {personality_traits}
        Then, I will give you a Human Computer Dialogue based on this Human Human Dialogue, where BJ simulates the role of a Human (converting BJ's utterances in the original Human Human Dialogue), and BS simulates the role of a Computer (converting BS's utterances in the original Human Human Dialogue). In this simulation, only the style of each utterance will be changed without altering its content and meaning.
        ## Human Computer Dialogue:
        {human_computer_dialogue}
        The conversion of this Human Human Dialogue into Human Computer Dialogue is based on the following Additional Knowledge:

        Now, I have received several different evaluatorsâ€™ feedback regarding the issues with this transformed Human Computer Dialogue:

        Your task is to revise this Human Computer Dialogue based on the feedback (you may need to refer to the original Human Human Dialogue, Personality traits score & Personality Traits Description and Additional Knowledge) and output a completely new Human Computer Dialogue. The output format should remain consistent with the original Human Computer Dialogue.

        **Important!!!** The newly generated Human Computer Dialogue must consider the content of each feedback simultaneously. Your response should only include the newly generated Human Computer Dialogue and no additional titles or information.

    BJ: "Well, it's probably something like 'Wednesday Downtown'." 
    BS: "Was it the program that starts around 10 PM?" 
    BJ: That's right! Haven't you seen it? 
    BS: It seems like something I've seen before... I think it was a program verifying some theory... 
    BJ: Yes, that's right. Pranks are mainstream, I suppose. 
    BS: Is that so! Do you like pranks? Or is it comedians that you like? 
    BJ: I like pranks and comedians too! Do you have a favorite comedian? 
    BS: I see! Is it Sandwich Man? And Jiro from Shisonnu just makes me laugh by looking at him. 
    BJ: Both of them are very wonderful people! I like them too. 
    BS: Sure. Here is the translated sentence: "That's nice. The Sandwichman duo is also great because their hosting is steady." 
    BJ: No matter how many times I watch the year Sandwichman won the M-1, I end up crying. 
    BS: I see! I'll take a look! Do you have a favorite comedian? 
    BJ: Hmmm. I think the amazing one is Mr. Tanaka from Ungirls. 
    BS: What do you think is amazing about it? 
    BJ: Not only are they a weird character, but I also think they must be smart because they're strong in comedy improvisation! 
    BS: You are also good at Ogiri! You certainly have an intelligent image. 
    BJ: I get the feeling of an entertainer. 
    BS: Certainly. I do miss the Janga Janga era.

    BJ: Library! It's really wonderful! 
    BS: There is a relatively large library quite close to my house! 
    BJ: Do you like books? 
    BS: That's right. I love books! Digital ones are nice, but I like the feel of paper.

    BS: I see. Is there a library or bookstore nearby? 
    BJ: Neither of them are at the nearest station. What kind of books do you like? 
    BS: That's unfortunate. I used to read novels in the past, but recently it's more practical books and self-help genres. 
    BJ: So, if I think about it, it might have been years since I last read properly. If you have any recommendations, I would love to hear them! 
    BS: I see. The book that helped lower the hurdle of finding cooking a hassle during this season was a book called "Tsumamimeshi"!

    BJ: Ah, you are publishing a book. That seems useful. 
    BS: "Yes. It's quick to make, so it helps during dinner time." 
    BJ: "Is that book also available in the library!?" 
    BS: Yes, it's there! There are also quite a few recipe books, which is very helpful. 
    BJ: Amazing, it seems to be quite a big place. I feel like going to the library again after a long time. 
    BS: Yes, I think the library is a good idea! They also have magazines and such! 
    BJ: More than anything, it's free, right? It would be great if there was a movie version of the library too.

    additional_knowledge = """
    Differences Between Human Human Dialogue (HHD) and Human Computer Dialogue (HCD):

    Communication Styles:

    HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are characterized by brief, frequent exchanges that prioritize efficiency. Users expect clear, straightforward responses without unnecessary elaboration.
    Example: User: "What time is my next meeting?" System: "Your meeting starts at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B."

    HHD: Conversations between humans are more nuanced and context-rich, often incorporating additional details, shared thoughts, or collaborative reasoning.
    Example: Person A: "The weather app says itâ€™ll stay clear, but the sky looks a bit hazy. Do you think we should leave earlier for the hike?" Person B: "Good pointâ€”maybe we can avoid the afternoon crowd too. Letâ€™s aim for 8 AM instead!"

    Relational and Personality Expression:

    HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are transactional and lack emotional depth or personal connection, as machines are incapable of genuine empathy or emotional understanding.
    Example: User: "Iâ€™m overwhelmed with work deadlines." System: "Would you like me to schedule a reminder for your tasks?"

    HHD: Human interactions are infused with emotional expression, humor, and openness, fostering trust and mutual understanding. These exchanges often include empathy, support, and shared problem-solving.
    Example: Person A: "Iâ€™ve been swamped with deadlines all weekâ€”itâ€™s exhausting." Person B: "That sounds rough. Want to grab coffee later? We can brainstorm ways to tackle it together."
