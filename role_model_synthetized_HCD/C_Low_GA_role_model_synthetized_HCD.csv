1,"""GA: Good evening. CB: Good evening. GA: Have you eaten dinner? CB: Yes. I had fried rice. GA: Fried rice is good. Did you make it yourself?CB: I used leftover rice to make it. GA: I see. We had vegetables, miso fish, and avocado. CB: How did you eat the avocado? GA: Dipped in soy sauce. It was delicious. CB: Avocado is delicious. Is it hard to choose when buying? GA: My mother cooks for us. Avocado is often on the menu. CB: It’s nutritious and well-balanced. GA: Maybe not balanced, but it’s always delicious. CB: Your mother is a good cook. Do you have a favorite dish? GA: I don’t think about it much. Sometimes we get prepared meals. CB: I understand. Planning menus can be difficult. GA: If I lived alone, I wouldn’t cook much. I might skip meals. CB: That’s common when living alone. GA: Do you have children? It must be tough. CB: Yes, my kids are home because their classes are closed. GA: My mother used to ask what I wanted to eat. CB: My family asks too, but preferences often differ. GA: I always said anything was fine or asked for curry rice. CB: I might have done the same. GA: It’s hard to decide what to say. CB: Do you eat all three meals at home? GA: Mostly just dinner. CB: Are you at work or school during the day? GA: I’m at work. Today was tiring. CB: Good work. I was working too, now taking a break."""
2,"""GA: Please! CB: Thank you in advance. GA: What kind of music do you usually listen to? CB: Yorushika, Humbert Humbert, Yoasobi, and various others. GA: I’ve only heard of Humbert Humbert recently. Are they new? CB: No, they are not recent. Their music is often used in commercials. GA: I might have heard them without realizing it. Can you tell me a specific title? CB: Misawa Home is one example. GA: I just checked, and I recognize that one. CB: Understood. GA: I used to listen to Yorushika and YOASOBI a lot, but not as much lately. CB: I primarily listen to female vocalists. What about you? GA: Recently, I’ve been listening to songs by DIALOGUE+. CB: This is my first time hearing about them. GA: They are a new voice actor idol group, so they might not be well-known yet. CB: I have searched for them on Amazon Music. GA: Their music is produced by Tabuchi from UNISON SQUARE GARDEN, so it’s high quality. CB: I am listening now. It has a pop sound. GA: Yes, it’s mostly pop, but the mood can shift to something cooler or more dramatic. CB: Do you attend their concerts? GA: I went to one for the first time recently. CB: How was the experience? GA: The seats were close, so it was very satisfying. The performance was both cute and cool, and it left a strong impression. CB: Attending in person can be exciting. GA: I enjoy live band performances, and the venue had a capacity of 1000, so the impact was great. CB: That is a sizable venue. GA: It didn’t feel like a typical live house, but since they are still new, the scale was relatively small. CB: Gathering that many people as a new group is impressive. GA: They debuted about 2-3 years ago, but they seem to be working hard. CB: Thank you for the information. I am not very familiar with idols."""
