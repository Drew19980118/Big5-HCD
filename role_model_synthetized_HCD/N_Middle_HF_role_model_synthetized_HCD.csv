You can read it for free now! Have you ever read One Piece? GL: Yes, I have read the standalone books in the first half and watched the anime up to a few years ago. I have reviewed the story for now. HF: I see! What kind of manga have you been reading so far? GL: I have read older manga like Dragon Ball and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, influenced by an acquaintance.  HF: I really like Dragon Ball a lot too! Have you watched the anime? GL: Yes, but I have not watched the recent Dragon Ball anime. HF: I don't know much about the recent ones either! Have you seen Z or GT? GL: Yes, I have watched up to a certain point in GT, but that is all. HF: I see! I really like GT's songs and listen to them often. GL: I occasionally listen to music as well. HF: Sounds good! Anime songs have many good tunes, so please try listening to various ones. GL: Thank you for the suggestion."""

GL: I do not have a strong preference, but if I had to choose, it would be the local J-League team. HF: Have you ever attended a game? GL: Yes, I attended games when I was younger and even had some experiences on the field. HF: That’s great! Have you gone recently? GL: No, I have not attended recently, but I would like to if given the chance. I mostly watch games on TV. HF: Watching on TV is comfortable, but attending in person is exciting. You should try it. GL: I agree. The sense of presence is different, and I would like to experience it again. HF: Singing cheering songs at games is fun. GL: Yes, it adds to the excitement."""
