1,"EE: Hello, nice to meet you.
BL: Hello. Nice to meet you.
EE: What do you do on your days off?
BL: Looking at your smartphone, going shopping, and studying.
EE: Same here. What do you often do on your smartphone?
BL: There is a lot of research to do.
EE: Don't you play games or anything?
BL: I hardly play games.
EE: I often read manga on my smartphone.
BL: Do you have any manga apps installed?
EE: Yes, I do.
BL: Manga often comes through advertisements, doesn't it?
EE: Yes, I end up adding more apps from interesting ads.
BL: Is your smartphone's storage capacity okay?
EE: Since I am using an Android, I can increase the storage capacity with an SD card.
BL: Can apps also be stored on the SD card?
EE: Mainly, I store photo data.
BL: I include photos too.
EE: Are you using an Android?
BL: I have both an Android and an iPhone.
EE: Me too!
BL: How do you differentiate between them?
EE: I mainly use Android and only take out the iPhone when needed.
BL: I see.
EE: How do you differentiate using them?
BL: I use them for calling and communication.
EE: I also often use my iPhone for calls.
BL: I'm the opposite. I use an Android for calls.
EE: I see.
BL: It's convenient to use them differently, isn't it?"
2,"EE: Hello
BL: Hello.
EE: What's your favorite household chore?
BL: Hanging out the laundry.
EE: It's fun, isn't it?
BL: It feels refreshing to hang out things that have become clean.
EE: I agree. Clothes look great without wrinkles.
BL: If you leave it in the washing machine for too long, it feels unfortunate.
EE: If you forget, it starts to smell and wrinkle.
BL: Yes, wrinkles are a problem.
EE: I iron clothes before hanging them up.
BL: Is it fully automatic? Do you stop it intentionally?
EE: I set the dehydration to zero and run it up to rinsing.
BL: Our washing machine doesn't have that function. Nice feature.
EE: It's convenient for items that wrinkle easily.
BL: I have to press the stop button manually.
EE: Timing is hard when doing other things.
BL: Yes, it's difficult.
EE: I want a fully automatic washer-dryer in the future.
BL: That would make household chores easier.
EE: It would be convenient, though it would remove the enjoyment of hanging clothes.
BL: Then I'd want other convenient household items too.
EE: I also want a Roomba.
BL: Me too. I'd like a dishwasher.
EE: It's the modern version of essential tools.
BL: It would save a lot of time.
EE: The world has become convenient.
BL: Roomba should move the luggage out of the way too.
EE: Yes, looking forward to updates.
BL: Looking forward to updates!"
