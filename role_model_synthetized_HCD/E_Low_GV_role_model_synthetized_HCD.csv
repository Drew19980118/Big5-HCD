1,"""GV: Hello. Nice to meet you. GL: Hello. Nice to meet you too. GV: Are you doing any part-time job? GL: I am not currently engaged in any specific part-time job. My work primarily consists of short-term part-time roles. Are you working part-time? GV: I can't provide details, but I currently work in customer service. I am not a host or similar. GL: Understood. I have prior experience in customer service as well. GV: My work is short-term. I have done one-off part-time jobs and still do them occasionally. GL: Noted. Do you prefer short-term or long-term part-time jobs? Does it depend on the job content? GV: I prefer single-day jobs. The pay is good, and if I don’t like the place, I can leave after one day. GL: Agreed. One-time jobs often offer better relationships and pay. Where are you registered? GV: I can’t mention the name, but it’s a well-known place. GL: Understood. Apologies for the personal question. Locations have their pros and cons. GV: Correct. The quality varies significantly. GL: What type of part-time job do you prefer: task-based or customer service? GV: I prefer task-based work. I’m not very good at customer service. GL: Understood. I also prefer task-based work, but customer service roles are more common. GV: Improving communication skills through customer service can help with future job hunting. GL: True. Human relationships are important. Preferences exist, but we must adapt. GV: In a company, you can’t choose who you interact with. I’m not in a position to speak authoritatively. GL: Correct. Interacting with people is unavoidable and can be challenging. GV: Which industry are you considering for employment? GL: Currently, I am considering the medical field. GV: That’s impressive. Does that mean six years of university? GL: Yes. Six years are required to qualify. GV: Medical school? I’ve heard it’s very tough. Good luck. GL: Thank you. Medical school is demanding but rewarding. GV: So, pharmacy or nursing? GL: Something along those lines. GV: I hope COVID-19 subsides by the time we graduate. GL: Agreed. Improvement would be beneficial."""
2,"""GV: Hello! What are your hobbies? GL: I don’t have specific hobbies, but I occasionally swim. GV: I sometimes swim at the municipal pool. GL: I also swim at the community gym. Did you take swimming lessons? GV: I took swimming classes in elementary school. GL: I haven’t exercised much lately and feel I should start moving more. GV: I didn’t exercise before, but now I go to the gym to lose weight. GL: How often do you go to the gym? GV: About 5 times a week. I go regularly when I have no other plans. GL: That’s impressive. You go frequently. GV: I finished job hunting and earned all my credits, so I have free time now. GL: What activities do you do at the gym? GV: I mainly use the bicycle machine, riding 20km daily and burning around 300kcal. GL: Bicycles are great. That’s a good workout. GV: 300kcal is a rough guideline I follow. I also do some strength training. GL: What kind of strength training? GV: I’m not familiar with the terms, but I pull weights down with my hands. GL: That exercise looks intense. GV: You can adjust the weight, so it’s manageable. GL: I go to a kickboxing gym. GV: Is it like kicking a sandbag? GL: That’s one option, but face-to-face interactions are more common. GV: That sounds intense. I don’t think I could try it easily. GL: I’m not athletic or strong, and I avoid fights. GV: Avoiding fights is best. I rarely engage in them. GL: I want to get stronger, so I joined a gym my friend recommended. GV: I also want to avoid being underestimated at work, so I focus on strength training. GL: Being muscular helps avoid being underestimated. GV: It’s an important factor. GL: Let’s work hard on strength training together."""
