1,"HQ: Hello GR: Hello HQ: The weather is still bad, right? GR: Today, it is not raining. HQ: Is it sunny? GR: It is cloudy. HQ: I hope it gets sunny. GR: Frequent rain can negatively affect mood. HQ: The temperature changes are extreme. GR: Drastic temperature changes may impact mental health. HQ: Maybe that’s why I feel uneasy. GR: That is possible. HQ: It’s getting colder, more like winter than autumn. GR: It feels like winter but has slightly improved. HQ: I turned on the heater because it was cold. GR: Using the heater this early is uncommon. HQ: We were using the air conditioner, but now we’re using the heater. GR: I purchased a blanket. HQ: A blanket sounds good. I should buy one too. GR: A blanket may not be sufficient without a comforter. HQ: Will you buy a comforter? GR: I have not purchased one due to storage concerns in summer. HQ: Even compressed, it takes up space. GR: Relying on the heater may be necessary. HQ: I need to clean the air conditioner. GR: I also need to contact a contractor. HQ: It’s moldy. GR: Mold accumulates quickly. HQ: I’m worried about breaking it if I clean it myself. GR: That is a valid concern."
2,"HQ: Hello GR: Hello HQ: What did you do during the three-day weekend? GR: I went out for a drink. That was all. HQ: It was raining, right? GR: Correct. What about you, HQ? HQ: I stayed home the entire time. My friend went to Atami. GR: Interesting. Was it a hot spring trip? HQ: Yes, it seems so. It was reportedly crowded. GR: It was a three-day weekend. HQ: Weekdays might be better for such trips. GR: Having weekdays off would be ideal. HQ: Agreed. Otherwise, paid leave would be necessary. GR: Understood. I would like to visit a hot spring. HQ: City spas are an option, but perhaps not ideal. GR: They tend to be expensive. HQ: True, they can be costly. GR: City locations are crowded and not relaxing. HQ: In Tokyo, that’s often the case. Less crowded super sentos might be better. GR: Many elderly people frequent them. HQ: That could be true. GR: There’s a super sento nearby, but it’s quite expensive. HQ: How much does it cost? GR: Approximately 3000 yen. HQ: That seems a bit high. GR: Non-chain public baths cost around 500 yen. HQ: That’s affordable. Have you visited one? GR: Not yet, but I am considering it. HQ: If the 500 yen option is good, it might be worth trying. GR: Noted."
