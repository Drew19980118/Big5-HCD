1,"DE: Hello, nice to meet you.
DD: Hello! Nice to meet you too.
DE: What did you have for lunch?
DD: I haven't had lunch yet. I had a late breakfast. What did you have?
DE: I had deli bread and supermarket takoyaki.
DD: Could you tell me more about the savory bread you had?
DE: It was a roll with cutlet and cabbage inside. It was tasty.
DD: That sounds delicious. Maybe I will have some bread too.
DE: Do you like bread? What kind of bread do you usually eat?
DD: I enjoy bread. Recently, I've been eating loaf bread from a nearby bakery.
DE: That sounds good. What kind of loaf bread is it?
DD: It's made with quality ingredients and tastes sweet even without any toppings.
DE: There seem to be many specialty bread shops opening up lately.
DD: Yes, that's true. I've noticed that as well.
DE: I see stores with long lines that sell out quickly, but I prefer not to wait in line, so I haven't bought from them much.
DD: I agree. I don't usually buy things if there's a long line. I don't wait in line for ramen either.
DE: People often line up at ramen shops. It's a competitive area for ramen.
DD: Do you like ramen?
DE: I didn't before, but my husband influenced me, and now I enjoy it. How about you?
DD: I haven't been a big fan, but my tastes are changing, so I might try it soon.
DE: How about trying somen or soba?
DD: I prefer udon over soba, but ramen is my least favorite noodle dish.
DE: Udon is great. I like Sanuki udon.
DD: Sanuki udon is delicious. I think I might have it for lunch now.
DE: Bread or udon? Both are made from wheat flour.
DD: Indeed. Maybe too much flour. I'll have rice for dinner.
DE: There's a lot of wheat flour in foods lately. I wonder what it would be like without it.
DD: I tried a gluten-free diet once because of my family. It was challenging.
DE: That's impressive. What made it difficult?
DD: Finding wheat-free food was hard, it was expensive, and I had to cook it myself."
2,"DE: Hello. Nice to meet you!
DD: Hello! Nice to meet you!
DE: Does your family live nearby?
DD: I live with my parents!
DE: That's nice. My hometown is quite far, and it takes me half a day to get there.
DD: Understood. Sometimes, people feel envious of those who can easily visit their hometown.
DE: A friend from the Kanto area often says the same thing.
DD: That's right! Going back to one's parents' house or taking short trips can be enjoyable.
DE: Yes, but choosing souvenirs can be challenging.
DD: Certainly! What type of items do they appreciate?
DE: Generally, it depends, but parents often prefer something other than sweets.
DD: I see! Do your parents not like sweets very much?
DE: Correct. I tend to be selective and avoid buying anything subpar. Haha.
DD: Understood. Proper research and preparation are essential. Haha.
DE: Do you buy souvenirs for your family often?
DD: Yes, we buy sweets frequently because everyone in our family enjoys them!
DE: What have you had recently?
DD: I recently ate ohagi from a Japanese sweets shop in the department store.
DE: I also enjoy wagashi. Ohagi seems to have become more stylish and delicious.
DD: That's right! They are visually appealing, though they don't last long, so I can only buy a small amount.
DE: Certainly. When I studied the tea ceremony, I would have seasonal Japanese sweets almost every week.
DD: Tea ceremony sounds wonderful! I've always admired it, especially the traditional sweets. Hehe.
DE: The elegance of the tea ceremony across the four seasons is refined and lovely.
DD: That's lovely. It's making me want to drink some matcha.
DE: I had matcha two days ago at a nearby Japanese-style café that serves wagashi and matcha.
DD: A stylish café in your neighborhood sounds nice! Do you visit often?
DE: Yes, about once a week. It's a casual place without formalities.
DD: Then you must be a regular customer!
DE: Yes. It's run by an acquaintance.
DD: That makes visits more enjoyable! Thank you very much!"
