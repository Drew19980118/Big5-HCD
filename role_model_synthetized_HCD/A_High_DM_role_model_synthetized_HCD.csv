1,"""DM: Good evening. BP: Good evening. How can I assist you today? DM: What did you do today? BP: Today, I completed cleaning tasks in the morning and spent time relaxing with my child. DM: Is today the last day of Obon? BP: Correct. I also lit the sending fire as part of the tradition. DM: I spent the day lazily and didn’t visit my hometown. BP: Understood. My family gathered on the 13th since my parents’ house is in the city. DM: Did it feel like a rare gathering? BP: Yes. It was the first time in a while. Three out of four siblings attended, along with their children. DM: That sounds nice. Your family seems close. BP: Thank you. My family and siblings maintain good relationships. DM: How old is your child? BP: My children are in 6th grade of elementary school and 9th grade of junior high school. DM: Are they preparing for exams? BP: Yes. This summer has been particularly busy due to exam preparations. DM: Is your child showing signs of nervousness? BP: Occasionally, they mention feeling nervous, but it doesn’t seem to deeply affect them yet. DM: I remember causing my parents a lot of stress during my exam period. BP: It’s common for such phases. Many experience heightened irritability during exams. DM: Thanks for understanding. BP: My children also sometimes prefer solitude during stressful times. DM: Wanting to be alone might be typical. BP: Affirmative. Parental guidance lectures suggest preparing for increased stress during adolescence. DM: Are these lectures held at schools? BP: I received a flyer from the school and attended a city-hosted lecture. DM: It’s impressive how much you care for your child. BP: Thank you. I aim to be prepared, having experienced similar challenges myself. DM: I’m rooting for you. Please take care not to overwork yourself. BP: Thank you. Let me know if you need further assistance."""
2,"""DM: Nice to meet you. Please. BP: Thank you. DM: Do you have hobbies? BP: Recently, I watch drama analysis videos on YouTube. DM: YouTube has those? I didn’t know. BP: Yes. Searching for drama analysis or historical drama brings up many results. DM: Dramas seem complex. BP: Correct. Last season, I watched analysis videos for My Family. DM: Does the investigation involve reasoning? BP: In My Family, there are multiple suspects and a culprit to identify. DM: Did you guess correctly? BP: My reasoning was correct, but I didn’t understand the crime’s motive. DM: Impressive. Why did you suspect the culprit? BP: Certain actions and dialogue raised red flags, so I suspected this person. DM: You’re sharp. I find it difficult. BP: It might be enjoyable once you start. Do you not watch YouTube often? DM: I watch YouTube frequently. BP: I see. My children also don’t watch TV; they only use YouTube. DM: Is that common for kids now? BP: Yes. They use tablets or watch on TV. DM: I don’t own a TV either. BP: That seems increasingly common among young people. DM: Having a TV might make me lazy. BP: You can also watch TV programs on Tver. DM: I saw an ad for that. Is it catch-up streaming? BP: Yes. Programs are available for free for about a week after broadcast. DM: Convenient. I might check out recent dramas. BP: The current drama with Mei Nagano riding a unicorn is interesting. DM: Thanks for the recommendation. I’ll check it out. BP: You’re welcome. Thank you."""
