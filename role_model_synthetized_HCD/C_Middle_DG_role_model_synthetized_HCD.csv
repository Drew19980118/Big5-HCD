BA: Good evening!
DG: Did the typhoon affect you yesterday?
BA: I was fine! How about you?
DG: It was manageable, but the cicadas got really loud when the rain stopped.
BA: That's interesting.
DG: They were very noisy!
BA: Yes, it's quite noisy, isn't it?
DG: This month is passing by so quickly.
BA: It's true! Have you done anything summery?
DG: No, I've been mostly at home. Did you go anywhere?
BA: I went to the sea and the pool.
DG: Sounds like an active summer! Did you get a tan?
BA: Yes, repeatedly.
DG: I'm envious; I just turn red.
BA: I see!
DG: Yes, the sunlight is intense this year.
BA: Are you taking care of your skin against UV rays?
DG: I'm using sunscreen, but I'm unsure about its effectiveness.
BA: It's hard to tell, right?
DG: Yes, I still got a bit of a tan.
BA: It's difficult to avoid, isn't it?
DG: Yes, I really like tanned skin.
BA: Is that so? It can cause spots, though!
DG: I already have some spots on my arm!
BA: Oh! Can people who blush easily also get spots?
DG: Somehow I turn red and then it just stays.
BA: That's unfortunate.
DG: I need to be more careful. Thank you.
BA: You're welcome."
