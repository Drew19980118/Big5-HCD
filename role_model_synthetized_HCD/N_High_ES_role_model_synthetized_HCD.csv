ES: Home-cooked meals sound similar for both of us. ER: I am usually indifferent since I eat lunch alone as well. ES: When you’re alone, you don’t make much effort, do you? Frozen udon is convenient, and I often eat it. ER: Frozen udon is nice. It seems refreshing when chilled during hot seasons. ES: There are many convenient options.

ER: No, another friend handles vocals. ES: Playing instruments seems like a good way to relieve stress. ER: I use headphones since I’m in a rental, but playing loudly is stress-relieving. ES: Headphones are convenient. I’m interested in wind instruments, but I’d need to rent a space. ER: Wind instruments can be loud, so that’s a good idea. ES: I haven’t started yet, though. ER: Some studios offer affordable rates for individual practice. ES: That’s helpful. If I start practicing, can I join your band? ER: Sure! Wind instruments stand out. Which one interests you?
