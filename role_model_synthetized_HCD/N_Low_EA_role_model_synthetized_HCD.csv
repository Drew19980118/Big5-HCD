1,"EA: Hello!
CP: Hello!
EA: It's been hot lately, hasn't it? How are you managing to stay cool?
CP: I put up bamboo blinds to block the sunlight.
EA: Is that a sudare? Can you remind me what kind that is?
CP: It's a type of woven grass covering used on windows.
EA: Oh, I remember now! Do you use it to open windows?
CP: No, it's for blocking sunlight. It creates a nice shade even with windows closed.
EA: Got it. So, it's kind of like a curtain?
CP: I actually wanted to use a green curtain.
EA: A green curtain? What's that?
CP: It's when you let plants like gourds climb on nets hanging from the house.
EA: Oh, it looks like a curtain made of plants. Is it hard to maintain?
CP: Goya can be left alone, but setting up the net is a bit of work.
EA: Is that so! Can you eat the bitter melon when it grows?
CP: Yes, it's very delicious.
EA: It's tasty, isn't it? I didn't like it much when I was a kid.
CP: I understand. I started liking it as an adult.
EA: Many vegetables are like that, especially eggplants.
CP: Yes, especially summer vegetables!
EA: Summer vegetables are great! Like cucumbers. Makes me feel nostalgic.
CP: Cucumber! Perfect for a refreshing snack in the season.
EA: So fresh and delicious! They also pair well with alcohol.
CP: Exactly! By the way, how do you cook bitter melon?
EA: I know about goya champuru. What else can you make?
CP: Champuru is great! I also make tsukudani and salad.
EA: Both sound delicious! I might try those recipes.
CP: Definitely! Salad with canned tuna is quite good.
EA: That seems simple to make! Perfect for summer.
CP: Yes! It also pairs well with alcohol."
2,"EA: Nice to meet you, hello.
CP: Nice to meet you!
EA: Did you take any lessons or classes when you were a child?
CP: I used to do piano and swimming.
EA: Do you still enjoy playing piano and swimming?
CP: I can't read sheet music for the piano, but I still swim!
EA: Does that mean you haven't played the piano for a long time?
CP: No, I've actually been playing quite a bit. I can even play some relatively difficult songs.
EA: That's interesting! So you can play even without reading sheet music!
CP: Yes, it's quite surprising. My teacher was surprised too.
EA: It seems like you've memorized it all by feel. That's impressive!
CP: Thank you. I just somehow manage it. But it means I struggle with new pieces.
EA: I understand. Are you very good at swimming since you've been doing it for a long time?
CP: My speed isn't very fast anymore, but I can swim continuously for one or two kilometers.
EA: Wow, that's impressive! I have trouble even with 25 meters now.
CP: Did you take any lessons?
EA: I played tennis for about 4 to 5 years.
CP: Tennis is great! Did you start in elementary school?
EA: I started in middle school. My friends invited me. I’m not that good at it though!
CP: I see. Was it hardball?
EA: Yes, it was hardball. I've also experienced softball in school classes, and they are quite different.
CP: Yes, I’ve played softball for fun too.
EA: I remember hitting with all my strength in softball being fun. Hardball really built up my grip strength.
CP: Really? That much of a difference. By the way, what is your grip strength?
EA: Around 50. How about you?
CP: That's amazing! Mine is probably less than 20.
EA: It seems like grip strength really needs training to improve. It was the same for the people around me.
CP: I see. I haven’t really worked out much myself.
EA: In hardball tennis, if you don't have grip strength, the racket might fly out of your hand.
CP: I see! I didn't know that!"
