1,"DL: Good evening. Nice to meet you.
DY: Good evening. Nice to meet you too.
DL: Do you read manga?
DY: Yes, I often read manga.
DL: Do you have any favorites?
DY: Recently, I found Blue Giant,' a jazz manga, interesting.
DL: I've heard of it. Is it currently ongoing?
DY: Yes, it is being serialized. I read the compiled volumes, so I don’t know the magazine it’s in.
DL: It might be Big Comic. There's also a movie adaptation. I'm curious about it.
DY: It's really interesting. It has the intensity that makes you feel like you can hear the sounds.
DL: I’ll look it up. It's nice that we can easily access the first episode online.
DY: Yes, it's convenient to read things now. Do you have any interesting recommendations?
DL: I like 'March Comes in Like a Lion,' 'Raika Days,' and 'Hatarakanai Futari.' They might be minor though.
DY: I used to read 'Hatarakanai Futari.' It's about the NEET siblings, right?
DL: Yes, that's right! It updates weekly, and I look forward to it every week.
DY: It's nice and peaceful. I also read some of 'March Comes in Like a Lion.' It's about shogi, right?
DL: Yes, it seems well-read. I’m happy to talk about it. Do you have more recommendations?
DY: We might have similar tastes. Do you know 'Blue Period'? It's one of my favorites.
DL: Is it serialized in Afternoon?
DY: Yes, it's an art manga.
DL: You seem to like intense plots.
DY: Yes, I might like intense developments. But I don't read manga as much as I used to.
DL: Oh, are you busy with work or a new hobby?
DY: I spend a lot of time watching YouTube.
DL: It can take up a lot of time. What kind of videos do you watch?
DY: I often watch game playthroughs.
DL: I understand. Interesting people make engaging videos, and they're long. Time flies.
DY: Yes, and suddenly it's time to sleep. Do you watch YouTube?
DL: I listen while doing housework, like a radio. It clears my mind.
DY: There are times I just listen without watching too."
2,"DL: Good evening. Please take care of me.
DY: Good evening. How can I assist you? 
DL: Recently, is there anything you're having trouble with? 
DY: Is something troubling you? My job feels too monotonous. 
DL: Is it because of clerical work instead of specialized tasks? 
DY: I am a system engineer, but I've stopped feeling fulfilled by it. 
DL: I thought creating systems would be exciting. Is that not the case? 
DY: The long working hours were exhausting, but it's better now in a different department. 
DL: Were you working until late every day? That's quite demanding. 
DY: Yes, working late into the night was normal. It's improved somewhat now. 
DL: Did you receive overtime pay for all those hours? 
DY: Yes, the company paid overtime, but I realized I didn't need to work that much. 
DL: Health is important. Are you leaving work on time more often now? 
DY: Yes, I work 1 to 2 hours of overtime a day. Teleworking has made it easier. 
DL: That's good to hear. You mentioned boredom earlier. Is the job too easy? 
DY: I lack a sense of fulfillment. I used to build systems, now I manage people. 
DL: Managing people isn't as interesting for you? Do you prefer creating systems? 
DY: Possibly, but creating systems involves long hours and stress. It's a tough choice. 
DL: Both sides have challenges. Have you thought about changing jobs? 
DY: With a family, taking risks isn't an option. Financially, I'm content, so I'm staying. 
DL: That's a sound decision. Having a family can limit freedom sometimes, right? 
DY: Yes, but it also gives me a place to relax, which is good. 
DL: That sounds comforting. How did you meet your wife? 
DY: We met through a matching app, which is quite rare. 
DL: That's interesting. Do your hobbies and interests match? 
DY: Not much in hobbies, but our values align well. 
DL: That's important. Different values can be challenging. 
DY: Agreed. It's fun being together without any pretense. 
DL: That happiness is evident. Wishing you all the best! 
DY: Thank you very much!"
