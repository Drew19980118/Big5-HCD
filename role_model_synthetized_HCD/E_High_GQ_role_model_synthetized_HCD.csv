GQ: It's gotten quite cool after the typhoon, hasn't it?
EB: Correct, temperatures might drop below 20 degrees at night.
GQ: I didn't prepare my futon, so I might catch a cold.
EB: We're still using a towel blanket.
GQ: I need to wash the blanket because my child and I are sharing it.
EB: It would be a good idea to start preparing soon.
GQ: I need to get my long sleeves ready.

EB: Yes, it can be inconvenient to switch clothes in and out.
GQ: Do you change your clothes yourself?
EB: The whole family helps out with that.
GQ: That's great! I usually do it by myself.
EB: That sounds tough. It's quite a bit of work.
GQ: I have to take my children's old clothes to the recycle shop, so it's a lot to handle.
EB: Nowadays, there are services that pick up your items for you.
GQ: I don't usually use those services, so I just take my own things.
EB: Using these services can be quite convenient.
GQ: I'll definitely try it next time.
EB: Yes, reducing the burden is always good.
GQ: Donating used clothes is an option too, right?

2,"GQ: Hello, nice to meet you.
EB: Thank you for initiating the conversation.
GQ: Do you play video games?
EB: I only play games for work or with my kids.
GQ: Is your job related to games? We have a child who loves the Switch.
EB: My job isn't related to games, but I translate and localize overseas games.
GQ: That's an interesting job! It could be useful for my child's future.
EB: Before the pandemic, I worked overseas frequently, but now I focus on translating dramas and movies at home.

GQ: That's amazing! I haven't been to the movies recently, though.
EB: It's challenging to go out these days. When I saw Evangelion, the theater was nearly empty.
GQ: Our high schooler has started watching foreign films with subtitles.
EB: For some movies, subtitles are definitely recommended.
GQ: That's true. Subtitles are harder with young children.

EB: It is difficult. Parents speaking first is crucial.
