1,"""HW: Hello. CA: Hello. HW: It's hot today. CA: It is hot. HW: Eating something cold would help. CA: Ice cream is a good option. HW: What flavor do you like? CA: Vanilla. What about you? HW: I prefer matcha. I always have matcha-flavored PALM in my refrigerator. CA: Matcha is a popular flavor. HW: Yes, I enjoy matcha-flavored items. CA: I will try matcha-flavored PALM next time. HW: It has a thick chocolate coating. CA: Noted. HW: Try it. CA: Understood. HW: What kind of shaved ice did you have? CA: Tiramisu shaved ice. HW: Interesting. CA: It had a strong tiramisu flavor. HW: What did it look like? CA: Cream on top with cocoa sprinkled over it. HW: It sounds visually appealing. CA: It attracts customers from outside the prefecture. HW: It seems popular. CA: It is.

2,"""HW: Hello. CA: Hello. HW: Do you usually sleep on a bed or a futon? CA: I use a futon. What about you? HW: I recently switched from a bed to a bunk bed. CA: Why did you choose a bunk bed? HW: My room is small, so I bought a bunk bed on sale. CA: That is a practical solution. HW: The bunk bed has storage underneath, which makes my room feel more spacious. CA: That is efficient use of space. HW: Beds and futons are easier to roll out of. CA: Rolling out is convenient. HW: With bunk beds, you have to climb down, which is inconvenient. CA: Climbing down adds extra steps. HW: If I had a futon or regular bed, I wouldn’t have been late so often. CA: Being a few seconds late is common. HW: Last night was hot near the ceiling because it was a tropical night. CA: Hot air rises, which can be uncomfortable. HW: The temperature doesn’t drop much at night lately. CA: Air conditioning is necessary in such conditions. HW: Air conditioning works better with futons or beds. Do you use it at night? CA: I use air conditioning at night. It is too hot otherwise. Do you use it? HW: I use it every night, but the cold air hits me directly since my bed is under the AC. CA: Direct cold air can be uncomfortable. HW: If I don’t use it, it’s too hot, but if I do, the cold air is too strong. CA: Have you considered sleeping on the lower bunk? HW: The lower bunk is full of stuff, so I wrap myself in a futon with the AC on. CA: Storing items on the top bunk could make it unstable. HW: I hadn’t thought of putting stuff on the top. Thanks for the suggestion. CA: I hope you can sleep better. Let’s talk again. HW: Yes, let’s talk again soon."""
