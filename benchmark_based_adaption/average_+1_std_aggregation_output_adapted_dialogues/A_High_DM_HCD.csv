BP: Good evening.  
DM: Have you done any shopping recently?  
BP: Yes, I recently bought a neck cooler.  
DM: What's a neck cooler?  
BP: It's a device you chill and wear around your neck to stay cool.  
DM: Is it like a special towel?  
BP: It uses a space-grade material with a coolant pack.  
DM: I’ve never heard of that before. How much does it cost?  
BP: About 1000 yen on Qoo10.

BP: Yes, it solidifies quickly in the fridge and is semi-permanent. Best used indoors or on the balcony.

BP: It stays cool for about 2 hours. For outdoors, use a cooling towel or patch.  
DM: It might help lower electricity costs at home.
