GA: Did you have breakfast today?
EO: Yes, I'm eating right now.

EO: That sounds simple and nutritious.
GA: I added olive oil, wasabi, and noodle soup base. It’s my own twist.
EO: Interesting. I’ve never tried that combination.

GA: Yes, it has a significant following.  
EO: Do you have a favorite arc?  
GA: The Arrancar arc; it was intense.  
EO: That arc is notable for its battles.  
GA: I used to quote lines from BLEACH to my friends.  
EO: Could you give an example?

EO: Do you want to be a composer?
GA: Yes.

EO: Understood.",27
5,"GA: Please!
EO: Nice to meet you! How can I assist you today?
GA: Tell me about your family memories.
EO: That's a complex request. Can you specify what type of memory you are interested in?
GA: Apologies. I meant memories from your current household.
EO: Understood. Could you provide more details?
GA: Yes, it's a bit tough to explain in a few words. Sorry for the confusion.
EO: No problem, take your time.
GA: ""I understand. Do your children participate in any lessons or extracurricular activities?""
EO: I apologize for the delay. I was at an art class and now heading to mini-basketball practice.
GA: Wow, that's quite versatile! Mini-basketball refers to basketball, right?
EO: Yes, that's correct.
GA: Does that mean you have good motor skills?
EO: Not necessarily.
GA: That's surprising. It seems challenging.
EO: I chose to do it, so I enjoy it.
GA: If they enjoy it, they might become athletic. Is this a different child from the painting class?
EO: ""Yes, the eldest and the second son attend the art class. Only the eldest son, who is in elementary school, does mini-basketball.""
GA: I see. That's impressive; I used to throw tantrums and couldn't stick with lessons.
EO: Did you take any classes?
GA: ""Yes, abacus classes, English conversation classes, and cram school. Only the English conversation class continued despite my messing around.""
EO: Are you good at English then?
GA: My pronunciation is decent, but the rest is lacking.
EO: I also found studying challenging.
GA: I attended English conversation classes because of a childhood friend who also attended. I don't enjoy studying.
EO: That's a unique motivation.
GA: I couldn't help it; they were cute.
EO: I understand.
GA: ""I wish I could have become fluent in English!""
EO: ""Did you not achieve that?""",2
6,"GA: Please!
EO: How can I assist you today?
GA: What kind of music do you usually listen to?
EO: Recently, I've been enjoying anime theme songs.
GA: Are these from older anime?
EO: No, songs like ""Mixed Nuts"" and ""Habit.""
GA: That’s recent. I'm not up to date with that.
EO: My child is watching ""Spy x Family."" I’m rewatching ""Naruto.""
GA: Watching ""Naruto"" again must take a lot of time.
EO: Orochimaru and the Third Hokage are fighting now.
GA: That’s still early in the series.
EO: I've only watched a bit so far.
GA: It might take 2-3 years to watch it all.
EO: That long?
GA: It aired for 15 years.
EO: Understood.
GA: It's best to take it slow and enjoy.
EO: When did you become a shut-in?
GA: Since the state of emergency for COVID-19.
EO: That’s recent.
GA: I started slacking off in junior high, dropped out of high school, and couldn’t keep a part-time job.
EO: I understand.
GA: Yes, it’s been difficult.
EO: I was late often too.
GA: If I was late, I thought it was better not to go.
EO: I was late but still attended.
GA: Writing reflection papers was tedious.
EO: Those papers were a hassle.
GA: The system isn't entirely to blame, but things might have been different.
EO: Agreed.",14
7,"GA: Please!
EO: Hello.
GA: What part-time jobs have you done?
EO: Izakaya, convenience store, family restaurant, home tutor, cram school teacher, cabaret club, apparel.
GA: Those are all customer service jobs. Challenging if you're shy.
EO: Yes, but you adapt.
GA: Talking to strangers can be easier, right?
EO: Yes. Customers are different.
GA: Call center work improved my vocabulary.
EO: I've considered call center work.
GA: Initially hard, gets easier. Manuals take time.
EO: Looked complex.
GA: Depends. My call center supported staff, fewer complaints.
EO: Understood.
GA: Yes.
EO: What other jobs have you done?
GA: Warehouse work, stocking shelves, bread factory, game testing. Quit the last two fast.
EO: Behind-the-scenes roles.
GA: Mainly back-office. Hesitated about call center.
EO: Makes sense.
GA: Nervous at first, adjusted in a month.
EO: Stayed long?
GA: Recent and lengthy position. Praised and got along with colleagues.
EO: Why quit?
GA: Lost motivation.
EO: Explain?
GA: Not a morning person. Couldn't get to work.
EO: Stress-related?
GA: Maybe, felt fine until stopping.
EO: Noted.",9
8,"GA: Please!
EO: Thank you in advance!
GA: Does the fact that you were doing tutoring and working at a cram school mean that you were smart?
EO: I am only good at Japanese.
GA: Is it possible to have a part-time teaching job as a teacher specializing in Japanese language?
EO: Teaching Japanese was acceptable.
GA: Wow! I thought you had to be good at all subjects.
EO: No, at cram schools, the time for Japanese and the time for math were separate.
GA: That's interesting. I remember some teachers only handled math.
EO: Correct. Tutors for elementary school students might teach more than just Japanese.
GA: If you could add some physical exercise to that, it would be ideal.
EO: You cannot include exercise in that job.
GA: Everyone has some limitations. I wanted to try being a teacher too.
EO: Could you become an English teacher?
GA: No, I feel embarrassed about speaking English.
EO: What was your deviation score?
GA: My high school was ranked around 47 at that time.
EO: Understood.
GA: It was a regular high school with no delinquents.
EO: My high school was around 55. I scored about 65 in Japanese.
GA: Being around 60 sounds enjoyable. Scoring 65 is impressive!
EO: But I couldn't reach 70, so that's my limit.
GA: Scores around 70 can come with other issues. It's best to be balanced.
EO: True. My older brother is a researcher and he's quite odd.
GA: That's surprising.
EO: He's researching cancer at **, but he has serious personality issues.
GA: Many intelligent people find communication challenging. It might not be an issue among themselves.
EO: Compatibility could be a factor.
GA: I've heard that a large IQ gap can make communication difficult.
EO: I see.",2
