1,"CF: Good evening!  
BW: Good evening. How are you handling the heat?  
CF: Thank you. Besides the cavities, I'm fine.  
BW: I have a cavity too and should visit the dentist soon.  
CF: Severe pain in June made me start going regularly.  
BW: I only go when absolutely necessary.  
CF: Regular check-ups are inconvenient.  
BW: Dental treatments and check-ups can be time-consuming.  
CF: With several cavities, I'll be visiting the dentist for a while.  
BW: I stopped after addressing my main concern.  
CF: I did that about three years ago.  
BW: Dental issues can recur quickly; finding a reliable dentist is important.  
CF: There are many dentists, making it hard to choose.  
BW: Reviews can help, but experiences vary.  
CF: Reviews and actual experiences can differ.  
BW: A popular dentist might not suit everyone.  
CF: I had that issue with my last dentist.  
BW: Food getting stuck after treatment can be a problem.  
CF: That is a common issue.  
BW: Sensitivity can occur after dental corrections.  
CF: Braces can cause sensitivity and are expensive.  
BW: They often don't respond much when reported.  
CF: Dentists are expensive, so it's frustrating when issues arise.  
BW: Issues should be addressed properly.  
CF: I find it hard to speak up.  
BW: My friend communicated their issues later on.  
CF: Were they able to respond?  
BW: Yes, but it required an additional fee.  
CF: An additional fee is concerning. Thank you for the information.  
BW: You're welcome. Thank you.",7
2,"CF: Good evening!
BW: Good evening. Do you exercise regularly?
CF: No, I don't.
BW: I also haven't been consistent due to a busy schedule.
CF: I tried water walking at the municipal heated pool and planned to go weekly.
BW: Is underwater walking effective for fitness?
CF: Yes, it's effective. I go back and forth in the 50m pool and sometimes use the flutter kick.
BW: Can you still swim using different strokes?
CF: I used to do the crawl and breaststroke, but probably not now.
BW: Swimming is more pleasant when it's not crowded.
CF: The municipal pool I go to is open until around 9 PM, so it's less crowded in the evening.
BW: Some pools have designated areas for swimming and walking.
CF: Yes, that's helpful.
BW: Keeping a routine is difficult.
CF: It takes determination to maintain consistency.
BW: Without a goal, it's challenging. I stretch at home occasionally.
CF: That's a good practice. I do simple stretches after long computer sessions.
BW: Prolonged computer use can cause stiffness.
CF: It affects blood circulation negatively.
BW: My shoulders and lower back are sore. I need to exercise more.
CF: It's hard to find time when busy.
BW: It often gets delayed.
CF: I understand.
BW: An app might help with consistency.
CF: Smartwatches and smartphones can manage routines well.
BW: They are convenient.
CF: I manage my sleep with my smartphone and check it daily.
BW: Monitoring sleep and heart rate is possible now.
CF: It's convenient. Thank you for the talk.
BW: Thank you for sharing.",11
3,"CF: Good evening.

BW: Understood. Koichi Sugiyama from Dragon Quest passed away.
CF: He was important.
BW: Games and their music are iconic. Thank you.
CF: Thank you.",25
4,"CF: Good morning. It's sunny and refreshing today.  
BQ: Good morning. It's raining here.  
CF: Is it a typhoon?  
BQ: Possibly.  
CF: Got it. It rained heavily here yesterday. Please stay safe.  
BQ: Thanks for the concern. There's been a lot of heavy rain recently.  
CF: Indeed, flooding is quite frightening.  
BQ: Have you experienced flood damage before?  
CF: Once, a nearby bridge collapsed. How about you?  
BQ: My town is fine, but the neighboring town often floods.  
CF: Cleaning up after a flood must be really hard.  
BQ: Yes, and I've heard the smell can be strong.  
CF: Especially in the summer when things spoil quickly.  
BQ: Does insurance cover flood damage?  
CF: I'm not sure, but I hope so.  
BQ: Fire insurance only pays out for total loss, which worries me.  
CF: That's quite concerning.  
BQ: Are you prepared for disasters?  
CF: I've done some stockpiling, but not enough.  
BQ: I haven't done much either. Should we stockpile more?  
CF: Yes, there are cookies that last five years.  
BQ: Some even rehydrate with water and seem quite tasty.  
CF: I've heard they are well-made and delicious. I'd like to try them.  
BQ: Getting used to the taste is important, but I hope we never actually need them.  
CF: Absolutely. Floods are scary, but earthquakes might be even scarier.  
BQ: A big earthquake is predicted. We need to take measures.  
CF: Every year I think, ""This year it will come!"" but my stockpile is still lacking.  
BQ: It's easy to avoid thinking about disasters.  
CF: I tend to ignore it. Thanks for the chat!  
BQ: Thank you.",6
5,"CF: Good morning.  
BQ: Good morning. Do you have any plans for Obon?  
CF: Normally, we would visit the grave, but due to COVID-19, we will not be doing it this year.  
BQ: Understood. I went there yesterday since I live nearby.  
CF: That sounds good. Was it hot at the cemetery?  
BQ: Yes, it was quite hot.  
CF: Your ancestors would appreciate your visit. Are you planning any outings besides Obon?  
BQ: I plan to visit a nearby hot spring.  
CF: Hot springs are nice. Do you go often?  
BQ: I go overnight about once a year, but I often go on day trips.  
CF: That's nice.  
BQ: Do you like hot springs?  
CF: I enjoy them. I used to visit super sento frequently.  
BQ: Super sento is comfortable and you can spend the whole day there.  
CF: I agree. Nowadays, some places look like manga cafes and seem fun.  
BQ: Yes, I liked taking naps in theater rooms.  
CF: I understand. It's nice.  
BQ: The food there, like ramen, is delicious.  
CF: Yes, snacks and beer are also good.  
BQ: It's enjoyable right after a bath.  
CF: That sounds like something I would enjoy.  
BQ: Some places also offer overnight stays.  
CF: I haven't stayed overnight, but it's convenient if you miss the last train.  
BQ: That's a good use case.  
CF: If I miss the last train, I’d prefer staying at a super sento.  
BQ: Manga cafes are cramped and only offer showers.  
CF: True. It's best to get home without staying over.  
BQ: Do you usually commute by train?  
CF: No, I work from home, so there’s no commute.  
BQ: Working from home sounds nice. Thank you.  
CF: See you later!",1
6,"CF: Good morning. Are you an early riser?  
BQ: Good morning. I wake up around 7:30.  
CF: I wake up at 5 a.m. on weekdays.  
BQ: That's early. Do you walk in the morning?  
CF: I'm busy with family tasks.  
BQ: Make sure to get some rest.  
CF: I wake up early to prepare bento lunches.  
BQ: Using frozen foods can ease the process.  
CF: Do you often use frozen foods? What's your favorite lunchbox item?  
BQ: I like grilled salted salmon.  
CF: A classic choice.  
BQ: It's good even when cold. What are your favorite bento side dishes?  
CF: I like kinpira and shibazuke.  
BQ: Sweet kinpira is nice.  
CF: White sesame seeds make it better.  
BQ: How long have you been making bento?  
CF: 13 years.  
BQ: Impressive.  
CF: Thank you. I'm not great at making tamagoyaki.  
BQ: Is tamagoyaki hard to make? Do you like it sweet or savory?  
CF: I prefer salty, but I make it sweet for my family.  
BQ: Any tips for making it like in stores?  
CF: Wrapping it well is hard.  
BQ: Any side dish you're confident in making?  
CF: Hamburger steak and kinpira.  
BQ: They seem harder than tamagoyaki.  
CF: I prepare them the day before.  
BQ: Prepared meals are convenient.  
CF: I like to sleep more. Thanks for the chat!  
BQ: Thank you.",5
7,"CF: Good morning. I thought I would buy something I want since payday is next week.
BQ: Good morning. What would you like to buy?
CF: It is a display that can be connected to a computer.
BQ: There are various types of displays. What kind are you looking for?
CF: I want to connect it to a laptop and have two screens.
BQ: A multi-display setup can increase efficiency. Do you have specific preferences?
CF: I want to watch videos while working.
BQ: That sounds practical. Have you found any suitable options?
CF: It's difficult to choose with so many options, isn't it?
BQ: A monitor arm could help with flexibility.
CF: It's something to consider.
BQ: I want to move it around a lot. Considering a Japanese-made one, but even used ones are expensive.
CF: That's quite a good price, isn't it? Worth considering.
BQ: Expensive options often perform better and reduce eye strain.
CF: I see, I didn't know that.
BQ: It's important to be mindful of eye strain during long computer use.
CF: I understand. I got blue light blocking glasses.
BQ: How effective are blue light blocking glasses?
CF: It's like wearing lightly tinted sunglasses.
BQ: Is there a noticeable difference without them?
CF: Yes, the brightness is different.
BQ: Does it feel darker with the glasses?
CF: Yes, compared to regular glasses, you can tell the difference.
BQ: I will consider getting a pair.
CF: Certainly! They reflect blue light depending on the angle, though.
BQ: That might look a bit unusual but interesting.
CF: When kids see it, they go ""Wow!""
BQ: It sounds like a scene from a movie.
CF: It does look that way! Thanks for the chat!
BQ: Thank you as well.",3

BZ: Nice breeze outside. I'll cut bellflowers for the grave.
CF: Bellflowers in the garden are lovely.
BZ: Replanted them, garden is full now.
CF: That sounds nice. Hard to garden on a condo balcony.
BZ: We have a small flower bed on the first floor.
CF: My cherry tomato plant withered recently.

BZ: Good to hear.",19
