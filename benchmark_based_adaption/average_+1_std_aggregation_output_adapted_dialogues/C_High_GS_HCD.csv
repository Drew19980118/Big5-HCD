DF: Is that so! Are there any dishes you often eat?
GS: I enjoy the hamburger there. How about you?
DF: Recently, I've been into young chicken prepared diavolo style.
GS: My friend recommended that before. Is it really delicious?
DF: Yes, it is tasty and also a good source of protein, as my gym trainer mentioned.
GS: I see! So, you exercise at the gym?
DF: Yes, I attend personal training sessions once a week.
GS: When I was a student, I used to exercise, but now I rarely do.
DF: I see. What activities did you engage in during your student days?
GS: I participated in track and field for six years.
DF: Track and field! Which events did you compete in?
GS: I mainly focused on the 100m and 200m sprints.
DF: You must be fast. That’s impressive.
GS: There were many fast runners, so standing out was tough.
DF: Yes, it is a popular event with many competitors.
GS: Exactly, reaching the finals was quite challenging.
DF: But it's commendable that you continued for six years!
GS: I started in my first year of junior high and continued until I had to prepare for entrance exams in my third year of high school.
DF: Consistency is admirable. What made you choose track and field?
GS: In 6th grade, I did well at a small track and field meet, and my teacher encouraged me to join.
DF: So, you have been involved in track and field since elementary school!
GS: Yes, because I could run a bit faster than others.
DF: I was usually one of the last, so I’m a bit envious.
GS: Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses.
DF: Indeed. Thank you for the enjoyable conversation!",1

GS: Scores are hard to improve.

DF: Good evening! How can I assist you today?
GS: When you were in elementary school, did you take any lessons or participate in any activities?
DF: Yes, I attended piano lessons, calligraphy classes, cram school, and played softball.
GS: Oh! I also took piano and calligraphy lessons!
DF: Acknowledged.
GS: I've been really feeling lately how important it is to have beautiful handwriting.
DF: Calligraphy classes often help develop beautiful handwriting.
GS: You mentioned that you also played the piano, so for how many years did you play?
DF: I learned piano from the age of 3 until I graduated from junior high school, over 10 years.
GS: That's impressive! So you must be quite skilled, right?
DF: I accompanied during chorus performances.
GS: If you can accompany, I think you are good enough!
DF: Understood. I focused on accompaniment.
GS: But it's nice to be able to play accompaniment. I only play solos.
DF: Do you still play now?
GS: I play occasionally. It's an electric piano, but since it's at my parents' house, I play it when I go back.
DF: Noted. I am unable to play currently.
GS: When you become busy, you don't have many opportunities to play, right...
DF: Correct. I am not sure if I can still read sheet music now.
GS: I see, I'm also not good at reading sheet music.
DF: Do you remember the music with your ears and eyes?
GS: It's more like I've played it many times and memorized it with my hands.
DF: Understood. Practice is key.
GS: Yes, I feel like I've improved by repeatedly practicing various things since long ago!
DF: Noted. Consistent effort is beneficial.
GS: Thank you. I can continue because it's something I like!

8,"GS: Please!  
FE: How can I assist you today?  
GS: What model of computer are you using?  
FE: I'm using Windows. How about you?  
GS: I also use Windows! I seriously considered switching to Mac, though.  
FE: I see. Macs have a cool design and smooth performance.  
GS: Isn't that right? I'm also imagining that it runs more smoothly than Windows.  
FE: Similar to the iPhone, Macs give a smooth experience when navigating.  
GS: Ah, that's great! I really like my iPhone because it's so good.  
FE: I had a chance to use a Mac once, and the screen quality was impressive.  
GS: The screen is beautiful, isn't it? On the other hand, are there any inconveniences?  
FE: Windows offers more customization options. Macs are less flexible in that aspect.  
GS: Ah, I see. But it's harder for viruses to get in because it's harder to modify, right?  
FE: Correct. In environments where many applications are needed, like a lab, Windows can be very useful.  
GS: So there are such advantages! I guess it has its pros and cons.  
FE: Exactly. In my research lab, almost everyone uses Windows.  
GS: I am also a science major, but I have started to wonder if Windows was the right choice after all.  
FE: I see. For those who use iPads, syncing issues often lead them to prefer Macs.  
GS: Since synchronization can be done with the iPhone as well, it must be the best. I admire it!  
FE: Yes, the seamless integration and features like AirDrop are excellent.  
GS: It's really great that the quality of photos and videos doesn't drop at all!  
FE: Currently, I send files through LINE, and the image quality reduces significantly.  
GS: That's right. When I sent a night view photo the other day, the image quality dropped a lot on LINE and I was shocked.  
FE: Night photos rely heavily on high quality. Sending them in original quality helps.  
GS: Even with the ORIGINAL, does the image quality not deteriorate?  
FE: Oh, is that so?  
GS: The other day it dropped! From 12 million to around 8 million.  
FE: That's a significant drop! I wasn't aware.  
GS: That's right. I'm shocked.  
FE: AirDrop seems to be the best method in that case.",1
