BJ: Do you prefer Japanese movies over Western ones?  
BQ: I prefer Japanese movies.  
BJ: Then U-NEXT is great because it has a lot of Japanese movies.  
BQ: It offers more titles than other subscriptions, though it's pricier.  
BJ: It can be cheaper if you share with your friends.  
BQ: I wasn't aware that was an option.

BQ: I see. Are you subscribed to any other services?  
BJ: I am subscribed to Netflix and Amazon.

BJ: There are a lot of interesting things on Disney Plus recently.

BQ: Yes, it's available on the platform.",9
3,"BJ: Hello!
BQ: Hello.
BJ: What is your favorite food?

4,"BJ: Good evening!  
BQ: Good evening. How can I assist you tonight?  
BJ: Did you have dinner?  
BQ: I ate sushi from the supermarket for dinner.  
BJ: Sushi sounds nice.  
BQ: It was quite delicious. What did you eat?  
BJ: I had a Chinese rice bowl.  
BQ: Chinese rice bowl sounds good. Was it from a restaurant?  
BJ: No, it was instant food. It wasn't very tasty.  
BQ: That's unfortunate. Quail eggs can sometimes improve the experience.  
BJ: I like quail eggs too. There were some small ones on it.  
BQ: There are various kinds of convenient foods.  
BJ: Recently, the quality is high. Convenience stores are astonishing.  
BQ: Their product development is impressive.  
BJ: Indeed. Do you get a chance to eat it?  
BQ: Occasionally, on my days off.  
BJ: It's delicious, isn't it? I like Seven the most.  
BQ: Seven-Eleven has good options. However, they sometimes use false bottoms in their packaging.  
BJ: That's right, and recently it has become really expensive.  
BQ: Prices have increased. Sometimes the quantity decreases while the price remains the same.  
BJ: The most surprising thing was that the fried chicken stick was 180 yen.  
BQ: That is surprising.  
BJ: When I was a student, I remember it being 100 yen.  
BQ: Coffee has also gradually increased in price.  
BJ: Oh, really? I didn't know that.  
BQ: It has gone up by about 10 yen. Convenience store items are generally expensive.  
BJ: Even so, people still buy them.  
BQ: It is concerning that continuous price increases might become difficult to keep up with.  
BJ: All these price increases are really frustrating.  
BQ: It is. A price reduction seems unlikely in the near future.",1
5,"BJ: Good evening!  
BQ: Good evening.  
BJ: What is the thing you want the most right now?  
BQ: I'm undecided. Should it be a car?  
BJ: Cool! Do you have a specific type in mind?  
BQ: I'm not sure. Maybe a sedan?  
BJ: Having a car can be pretty handy for a lot of things.  
BQ: That's true. Is there a car you would like to drive?  
BJ: I'd love to try a Beetle Cabriolet someday.

BQ: I don't know much either, but it looks stylish, which is enough for me.  
BJ: Definitely! I'm not sure about things like fuel efficiency yet.  
BQ: I've heard that most modern cars are pretty fuel efficient.  
BJ: I see. It would be nice to ride one someday!  
BQ: Yes, that's right. I'll make it my goal for a while.  
BJ: That's a good idea.  
BQ: Thank you. What do you want the most right now?

BQ: It's the ultimate item that can be used for anything.  
BJ: Actually, I'm thinking about getting married.

BQ: Are you thinking about wedding expenses?  
BJ: Yes, and living costs for two people, among other things.  
BQ: Finding a home can be a challenge. I hope you both find the right place.  
BJ: That's right. Thanks. Married people are truly amazing.

AU: I don't really like it, and if anything, I mostly watch videos.  
BJ: Are you referring to something like YouTube?

AU: That's it! It was fun back in the day, wasn't it? I loved that.  
BJ: There is a modern version of that, isn't there?  
AU: Yes. All the children have completely grown up. It's strange, but I watch them while remembering the old days.
