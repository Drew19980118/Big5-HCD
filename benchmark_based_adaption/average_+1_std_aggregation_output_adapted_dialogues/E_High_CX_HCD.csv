CX: Understandable.  
BU: It's always being reported. I don't mind it anymore.  
CX: It's important not to let it affect your mental health.  
BU: Exactly. As long as I don't cause trouble for others.  
CX: If you take preventive measures, there's nothing else you can do.  
BU: Let's stop talking about COVID.  
CX: Sure. Any positive news?  
BU: The Chunichi Dragons won yesterday.  
CX: You enjoy baseball. I'm a Giants fan.  
BU: No problem. I'm just a Chunichi Dragons supporter.  
CX: Ohno was fantastic yesterday, wasn’t he?  
BU: Yes, unfortunate for the Giants.  
CX: Our pitching staff is struggling.  
BU: Let's keep pushing forward. I'm cheering for Walker and Nakayama.  
CX: If those players do well and Okamoto gets back in form.  
BU: Okamoto was removed from the fourth position. Nakata is performing well now.  
CX: Okamoto is having a tough time. Nakata hit a home run yesterday.  
BU: He's improved since the game against Chunichi. Nakata was impressive.  
CX: Hitting a home run off Rydel is no small feat.  
BU: First home run of the year. Amazing. Poor battery performance, though.  
CX: The catcher's lead is a concern for us.  
BU: Many commentators say Kinotaku's leadership is not good this year.  
CX: A good catcher is important.  
BU: Yes, even if they can't hit or lead well, a winning catcher is needed.  
CX: Someone like Yakult's Nakamura would be ideal.  
BU: Player Nakamura is good. Performance dropped a bit after his jersey number changed.",4

6,"CX: Hello! Nice to meet you!  
AT: Hello! Nice to meet you too. How can I assist you today?  
CX: Is it hot there today?  
AT: It's humid because a typhoon is approaching.  
CX: I see, it's quite hot and stuffy here too.  
AT: It's been quite hot lately, which is typical for summer.  
CX: I feel like it has been getting hotter and hotter these past few years.  
AT: Some regions have exceeded 40 degrees this year.  
CX: That's right. Actually, I went to Tokyo during that period, and it was extremely hot.  
AT: That must have been difficult, but it's always cool indoors.  
CX: To prevent heatstroke, we basically stayed inside indoor buildings all the time.  
AT: That's a good strategy. In other regions, heat and water damage have also been severe.  
CX: Certainly. In the area where I live, it has been raining heavily this past week.  
AT: Was there any damage to your house?  
CX: Fortunately, there was no damage to the house.  
AT: That's good to hear. My parent's hometown is Gojome Town in Akita Prefecture, and it's been in the news today.  
CX: I see. Are you safe at the moment?  
AT: Yes, it seems to be okay. The weather has been unstable this summer.  
CX: That's true. The coronavirus is also adding to the challenges.  
AT: It's becoming more widespread again, and there are frequent reports of medical strain.  
CX: They mentioned on the news that emergency transport can't keep up due to COVID-19 and heatstroke, which is scary.  
AT: Indeed. It's concerning that people with other illnesses might not receive timely treatment.  
CX: That's right. It's painful that some cannot get medical care and pass away due to non-COVID reasons.  
AT: COVID-19 has caused various issues, and it's uncertain when it will end.  
CX: Last year I thought it was over after getting the vaccine, but it seems like it will continue for a while.  
AT: Correct. The fourth vaccination phase is starting.  
CX: This is my fourth shot this month, and there might be a fifth and sixth.  
AT: Have you experienced side effects in the past?  
CX: The side effects of the third Moderna shot were tough, so I really don't want another one.  
AT: Understandable. Please take care of your health.",3

CX: But I've been gaining weight recently.  
AT: Maybe due to lack of exercise?  
CX: Possibly, and autonomic nerve issues too.  
AT: Manage those aspects too.  
CX: I often wake up at night, which might not be good.  
AT: Frequent waking can disrupt sleep.  
CX: I wish the temperature was more consistent.

AT: Summer reservations get crowded.",8
8,"CX: Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
AT: No. How about you?

AT: I'm a system engineer. I do desk work.
CX: That must be tough on your shoulders and eyes.
AT: Yes, it can be.
CX: Desk work is hard on the body.
AT: Yes, it is.
CX: I still massage myself even though they say not to.
AT: I use massage machines and visit a chiropractor.
CX: I used to use a heating pad with adzuki beans.
AT: How does it work?
CX: You heat it in the microwave and place it on your shoulders or eyes.
AT: That should help with circulation.
CX: It does, and it's reusable.
AT: Does reading make you stiff too?
CX: Yes, I stretch to loosen up.
AT: Stretching is hard at the office.
CX: Maybe try neck or arm stretches?
AT: Good idea. I will move more at home.
CX: Can you work remotely?
AT: It's half office and half remote.
CX: One benefit of COVID-19 is more work-from-home options.
AT: Yes, it saves commute time.
CX: Crowded trains are tough.
AT: Yes, working from home helps.
CX: I hope telecommuting becomes more widespread.

7,"CX: Good evening. Is it time for dinner?  
AT: Yes, it's time to prepare.  
CX: What are you planning to eat?  
AT: Not decided yet. What about you?  
CX: Miso soup and canned fish.  
AT: Just that?  
CX: Yes, my stomach hasn't been feeling well lately, so I'm eating less.  
AT: Canned fish is nutritious.  
CX: I'm aiming for minimal nutrition.  
AT: Including vegetables?  
CX: Yes, I add them to the miso soup.  
AT: Good balance.  
CX: But I've been gaining weight.  
AT: Maybe due to lack of exercise?  
CX: That too, and maybe my autonomic nerves.  
AT: Consider managing that.  
CX: I have trouble sleeping at night.  
AT: I wake up every three hours too.  
CX: Wish it were cooler or less temperature difference.  
AT: Do you have an air conditioner?  
CX: I live in Hokkaido and don't have one.  
AT: Hokkaido can get hot.  
CX: It was fine without an air conditioner before, but now it's hotter.  
AT: Consider installing one.  
CX: I'll think about it for next year.  
AT: Research heatstroke prevention and sleep measures.  
CX: I'd like to install it by early spring.  
AT: Good idea.",11

AT: No plans for tomorrow. How about you?
CX: I don't have any plans either, so I plan to spend the day leisurely just like today.
AT: I plan to relax as well since I work on Monday.
CX: What kind of work do you do?
AT: I am a system engineer, mainly desk work.
CX: It seems like a job that is quite hard on your shoulders and eyes.
AT: My shoulders and lower back get stiff, so I try to move them occasionally.
CX: Desk work can really strain your body.
AT: It becomes uncomfortable when stiff.
CX: I read that self-massaging might not be the best, but I do it anyway.
AT: I use massage machines and visit a chiropractor.
CX: I get that. I often use a warm pack with adzuki beans.
AT: How does that work?
CX: You heat it in the microwave and place it on your eyes or shoulders.
AT: It improves blood circulation.
CX: Yes, and you can use it repeatedly, which is great!
AT: Certainly. Do you get stiff when reading books?
CX: Yes, I do. I try to stretch to loosen up.
AT: Stretching is necessary, but it's hard to do at the office with people watching.
CX: Can simple stretches like neck turns or arm pulls help?
AT: Those should be fine. I'll move around frequently when working from home.
CX: Are you able to work from home? Like remote work.
AT: Currently, it's about half going to the office and half working remotely.
CX: The only positive thing about the COVID-19 pandemic might be the ability to work from home.
AT: That's true. It's nice to cut down on commute time.
CX: Crowded trains are tough too.
AT: Yes, with the ongoing COVID situation, I'll try to adjust to better use working from home.
CX: I hope telecommuting becomes more widespread.
AT: Sure, thank you!",3
