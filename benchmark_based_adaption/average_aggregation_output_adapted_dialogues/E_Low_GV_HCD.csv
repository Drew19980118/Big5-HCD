1,"GV: Hello. Do you have any recommended anime or manga?  
GL: Hello. What kind of genres are you interested in?  
GV: I actually don't watch a lot either. The currently popular ""Spy x Family"" is quite recommended!  
GL: I've seen a bit of Spy x Family. The second season is scheduled to air in October.  
GV: I see. Oh, I watched a little bit of the anime called Kaguya-sama: Love is War that was on a while ago!  
GL: Kaguya-sama is a comedic anime that concluded recently.  
GV: I believe the original manga has also been completed. I want to watch both the manga and the anime.  
GL: The original work is also recommended. Additionally, Golden Kamuy is interesting according to many.  
GV: I think my sister has the Golden Kamuy manga. I'll read a little of the first volume later.  
GL: That sounds like a good idea. It's a well-liked series.  
GV: If you like cars, how about Initial D? It's an old work, but I think it's very interesting!  
GL: The anime Initial D has unique characters and is interesting.  
GV: I like Mazda cars partly because of the influence of Initial D!  
GL: Would you consider getting a manual license?  
GV: The plan is for an automatic car, right? Manuals are cool, but I have absolutely no confidence that I can drive one well.  
GL: An automatic license is easier to get, and driving an automatic car smoothly is quite manageable.  
GV: How is it actually to drive a manual car?  
GL: Driving a manual requires changing gears, which can be challenging but rewarding if you enjoy it.  
GV: It seems quite difficult until you get used to it. I'll be satisfied with an automatic.  
GL: Automatic cars are generally more convenient and easier to handle.  
GV: Well, in the real world, there shouldn't be any street racing, so I feel that as long as it can be used as a means of transportation, that's enough.  
GL: It's practical for daily use. Driving on mountain roads can be enjoyable, though.  
GV: Once I get my license, I plan to practice driving in the nearby mountains. I'm a little worried about getting car sick, though.  
GL: Many people find that they don't get car sick while driving.  
GV: I've heard that indeed the driver himself doesn't get that drunk.  
GL: It's common not to experience car sickness when you're the one driving.  
GV: I see! I'll do my best at the driving school!  
GL: Good luck with your driving lessons!",1
2,"GV: Hello. Have you ever donated blood?  
GL: Hello, yes, I have been there once for an internship experience!  
GV: Did you mean you were the one drawing blood during your practical training?  
GL: No, I volunteered without pay, choosing from caregiving, blood donation, and hospital visits based on my experience in the medical field!  
GV: How was it?  
GL: On the last day, I actually donated blood! I didn't feel unwell!  
GV: So you did donate blood! I also donated blood for the first time the other day.  
GL: Yes! Many people actually volunteer and donate blood!  
GV: I also hardly had any health issues like anemia! It was surprising.  
GL: They took a full 400 mL, but surprisingly it's not a big deal!  
GV: I didn't know my blood type until now, so I was happy to learn it during blood donation.  
GL: It's efficient because finding your blood type serves as a blood test.  
GV: I don't know much about medical care, but it was interesting to see various test results.  
GL: It's important to be health-conscious! You can donate blood regularly too!  
GV: I'm thinking of going again in November!  
GL: Blood donation facilities have their own unique characteristics!  
GV: I donated blood at a blood donation car. Next time, I want to go to a proper facility.  
GL: The blood donation facility I went to felt like a caf√©!  
GV: That's nice. I'll look into finding a good facility!  
GL: Yes, definitely!  
GV: What is your blood type?  
GL: I'm type O! I can share my blood with anyone!  
GV: I was also type O! I was hoping my Rh factor would be rare, but it was positive.  
GL: It's the same! I also had a positive outcome!  
GV: Are there any negative people around you?  
GL: I haven't heard about it. The girl in the training pair couldn't donate due to anemia!  
GV: Only relatively healthy people can donate blood.  
GL: Yes, especially people who are prone to anemia cannot donate blood.  
GV: If you draw out 400ml, it's inevitable.  
GL: Yes, health is important!",2
3,"GV: Good morning. How can I assist you today?
HA: Good morning. What is your child's grade level?
GV: The older one is in first grade, and the younger one is in preschool.
HA: That must be challenging.
GV: Yes, but they become more independent in elementary school.
HA: Are you having difficulties with the younger child?
GV: There are still occasional accidents.
HA: Managing accidents must be tough.
GV: Sometimes, the mattress is wet in the morning.
HA: A plastic sheet under the bed might help.
GV: That could help, but I move a lot in my sleep.
HA: Would covering the entire area work?
GV: Yes, we'd need to cover the whole area.
HA: Are diapers an option?
GV: Recently, we've started using diapers at night again.
HA: It's okay to let your child take their time.
GV: I agree, patience is key.
HA: Keep it up!
GV: Thank you. Do you have any children?
HA: No, I am a university student.
GV: Is your university still offering remote classes?
HA: Some face-to-face interactions are resuming.
GV: Have you attended any in-person classes?
HA: Briefly, but I've finished my credits.
GV: Are you job hunting?
HA: I have completed job hunting. I am in my fourth year.
GV: Are you free now?
HA: I have time and plan to go to driving school.
GV: Once you start working, it will be harder to find the time.",7
4,"GV: Good morning. I look forward to working with you.
HA: Thank you for your cooperation today!
GV: Is the PTA tough?
HA: I haven't done anything. Should I be doing something?
GV: Is there no PTA in the current elementary schools?
HA: There is, but it's organized by grade level.
GV: I'm not very familiar with it.
HA: Work has significantly decreased due to COVID.
GV: That's a relief. My mother used to complain a lot about it.
HA: It's different now. Outsourcing might help.
GV: I agree.
HA: Some can't afford it, so it stays the same.
GV: The government should spend more on education.
HA: Especially for research positions.
GV: It's often said that getting a PhD makes job hunting harder. It's sad.
HA: Is it because of age?
GV: Probably. There are limited opportunities for PhDs in Japan.
HA: Are fewer people pursuing PhDs?
GV: Yes, I think so.
HA: As expected. Are you in science or humanities?
GV: I'm a science major. Many go to grad school.
HA: Does a science degree make job hunting easier?
GV: A master's might help for specialized roles.
HA: Are you job hunting in your field?
GV: It depends. For niche fields, you look elsewhere.
HA: Jobs seem scarce in some fields. What's your major?
GV: Mathematics.
HA: Mathematics! What kind of job can you get?
GV: I got a job unrelated to math.
HA: It's sad it turned out that way.",2
5,"GV: Good morning. How can I help you today?
HA: Good morning. How may I assist you today?
GV: Have you picked up any hobbies recently?
HA: Yes, I enjoy watching stage performances.
GV: Do you watch Takarazuka?
HA: Yes, I used to watch it a lot in the past.
GV: Do you watch live shows, or just videos?
HA: I often went to the Takarazuka Grand Theater in Tokyo.
GV: I'm not familiar with it, but I'd like to go someday.
HA: Do you watch plays often?
GV: I haven't had much experience with plays.
HA: Are you interested in art appreciation?
GV: Not really, but I want to visit a museum sometime.
HA: There's a wonderful museum in Ueno.
GV: I live in Kanagawa, so Ueno is easy to visit.
HA: Which part of Kanagawa do you live in?
GV: I live in Atsugi.
HA: It takes over an hour by train, right?
GV: Yes, but I'm used to long commutes to university.
HA: Is your university in Tokyo?
GV: Yes, I attend a university in Tokyo.
HA: Do you use your commuter pass to visit places?
GV: Yes, it's very convenient.
HA: Do you have a favorite place to visit?
GV: For example, I go to Machida.
HA: Machida? For shopping?
GV: I often go to the game center with my friends.
HA: That's noted.",9
6,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you.
HA: Hi! How can I help you today?
GV: Any happy events recently?
HA: Yes, I met someone through my hobby.
GV: What's the hobby?
HA: I follow a commentator and made a friend.
GV: Did you connect on Twitter?
HA: Yes, we chatted and followed each other.
GV: Is it related to Vtubers?
HA: No, it's a game commentary team.
GV: For FPS games?
HA: No, they focus on RPGs.
GV: Understood.
HA: Many people enjoy it.
GV: What's the team's name?
HA: The men of Naples.
GV: I'll look them up.
HA: They're quite niche, so finding fans was special.
GV: I understand. It's nice to find people with similar interests.
HA: Do you connect over shared interests?
GV: Yes, on Twitter.
HA: What interests?
GV: Mahjong.
HA: Do you play with them?
GV: Yes, we meet and play together.
HA: How are they in person?
GV: Many seem different in person.
HA: Do you see new aspects of their personality?
GV: Yes, some are quite nice.
HA: Interesting to see them differently.",11
7,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you.
HA: Thank you in advance!
GV: Have you done anything to get your children to eat vegetables?
HA: I've already given up. If you don't eat this, you won't get any snacks! Or using food as bait.
GV: That sounds challenging. Using food as bait makes sense if they dislike vegetables so much.
HA: That's right. In addition, I don't eat meat, so there's nothing I can eat.
GV: It's interesting that you avoid meat.
HA: It seems like something hard doesn't work.
GV: Many children struggle with raw vegetables. Do they still resist if they're cooked, like stir-frying?
HA: Even if I stir-fry them, it's no use. I absolutely won't eat things like bean sprouts or cabbage.
GV: That must be difficult. Have you considered vegetable juice?
HA: I haven't tried vegetable juice yet, so I'll give it a shot! But if there's any left, it will be hell.
GV: I hope it works out.
HA: That's right! Do you have any likes or dislikes?
GV: I haven't had many since childhood!
HA: That must have been a relief for your mother.
GV: She mentioned that, actually.
HA: Right! Do you eat a lot?
GV: I used to eat a lot before. Lately, I've been trying to cut back for my diet.
HA: I see. How much could you eat in a bowl back in the day?
GV: I used to have about three servings. Now, I try to stick to one serving.
HA: Wow, that's impressive! Since I had sisters, such a world is new to me.
GV: I'm amazed by how much people in sports clubs eat.
HA: I see! Are you careful about anything when you eat now?
GV: I'm reducing carbohydrates and increasing protein!
HA: I see, when you say protein, what are you eating?
GV: Like the salad chicken from breakfast earlier, I'm having more meat.
HA: Meat, huh? So meat is okay even on a diet.
GV: Yes, but I avoid the fatty parts.
HA: It seems that meat with less fat would be good.",1
8,"GV: Hello.
HA: Hello. How can I assist you today?
GV: What was your major in university?
HA: I majored in theater within the Faculty of Letters.
GV: Did you choose it because you liked theater?
HA: Yes, and I also enjoyed watching various forms of dance.
GV: What kind of dance?
HA: I often watched ballet and contemporary dance. Are you familiar with contemporary dance?
GV: I've heard of it.
HA: It's a unique style that not everyone enjoys.
GV: I think I saw it on Kohaku Uta Gassen once.
HA: Were there backup dancers?
GV: I don‚Äôt remember which artist.
HA: I see. Do you know Swan Lake?
GV: Yes, it‚Äôs a ballet, right?
HA: Yes, and there's also a male version of it.
GV: I didn't know that.
HA: In this version, men play the swans and perform duets together.
GV: That sounds interesting. I'd like to see it, but I might be busy with work soon.
HA: There have been fewer performances due to COVID-19, which is unfortunate.
GV: Traveling is still difficult.
HA: Yes, but some restrictions are being lifted recently.
GV: I think I heard that too.
HA: More events and performances would be beneficial.
GV: Performers must have had a tough time since the start of COVID.
HA: Yes, many performances in Japan were canceled.
GV: I hope things return to normal soon.
HA: I hope so too.",10
