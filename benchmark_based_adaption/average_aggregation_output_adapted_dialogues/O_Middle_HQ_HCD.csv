1,"HQ: Hello  
GR: Hello  
HQ: How would you use 100,000 yen?  
GR: I would use the full amount to pay off my debt.  
HQ: Do you have debt?  
GR: Yes, it's from a scholarship.  
HQ: A scholarship can be tough.  
GR: I want to repay it quickly.  
HQ: There are scholarship exemptions, right?  
GR: Yes, but those who repay might miss out.  
HQ: Is it okay not to repay?  
GR: If it’s okay, I might not repay.  
HQ: Understood.  
GR: I also used benefits to repay my student loans.  
HQ: Really? I invested mine.  
GR: Has it increased?  
HQ: It increased a little.  
GR: That's nice. I envy that.  
HQ: Have you ever invested?  
GR: No, I haven't.  
HQ: Are you interested?  
GR: It feels a bit scary.  
HQ: It can sometimes result in losses.  
GR: I might study investment after repaying my loan.  
HQ: Will you take on the challenge?  
GR: Yes, to increase my money.  
HQ: That’s right.  
GR: They say to let money work for you.  
HQ: Yes, it’s important.  
GR: That’s right.",1
2,"HQ: Good evening.
GR: Good evening.
HQ: Do you have an ideal way to spend a holiday?
GR: Two days of a three-day weekend for travel, and one day for rest is ideal.
HQ: Traveling for all three days can be tiring, right?
GR: Correct. I prefer spending the first day doing household chores and relaxing at home.
HQ: Noted.
GR: How do you spend your holidays, Bask?
HQ: I like to spend my time slowly.
GR: Do you go out often?
HQ: Not really. There's nowhere specific I want to go.
GR: What do you do at home?
HQ: Mostly watching anime and cooking.
GR: Cooking? You must make some elaborate dishes.
HQ: I don't usually make elaborate dishes just for myself.
GR: Understood. It's more effort when cooking for someone else, isn't it?
HQ: Yes, I can't afford to make mistakes.
GR: True.
HQ: I've also started enjoying taking walks.
GR: It has gotten cooler, making it easier for walks, right?
HQ: Yes. It becomes difficult to take walks in winter, so I'm staying active while I can.
GR: In winter, you prefer to stay indoors, correct?
HQ: Yes.
GR: During winter, I spend time at home watching anime and dramas.
HQ: Especially around New Year's, it's common to stay inside and relax.
GR: The main activities are the first shrine visit or attending sales, right?
HQ: I usually shop online for New Year's sales.
GR: Do you shop online often?
HQ: Sometimes, it's more reliable to get items like lucky bags online.
GR: Understood.",2
3,"HQ: Good evening.
GR: Good evening.
HQ: Are there any moments when you feel like you've become an adult?
GR: Is it when I start to feel age in my face?
HQ: I am also concerned because my face is sagging.
GR: Sagging is challenging to address, isn't it?
HQ: There's not much we can do.
GR: I am troubled by severe rough skin and dark circles.
HQ: Have you considered visiting a dermatology clinic for cosmetic treatments?
GR: I want to, but it's too expensive for me to afford.
HQ: Yes, it is certainly costly.
GR: It's not easy to go there casually.
HQ: I have also thought about getting a thread lift.
GR: Have you done it before?
HQ: No, it costs around 100,000 yen but only lasts for about six months.
GR: The cost performance is too low.
HQ: That's right. It's not worth it, is it?
GR: Is there nothing else effective for sagging?
HQ: I've heard HIFU is also good, but it ultimately costs around 100,000 yen.
GR: How long does it last?
HQ: This will also take about half a year.
GR: That's also not cost-effective.
HQ: Beauty clinics make substantial profits, don't they?
GR: It would be better if the treatments were cheaper.
HQ: In South Korea, it seems to be less than half the price.
GR: Because it's a beauty powerhouse.
HQ: I'm envious.
GR: I wish Japan would be like that too.
HQ: That's right.
GR: We can only hope that it becomes cheaper.",1
4,"HQ: Good evening.  
GR: Good evening.  
HQ: Would you choose a low-paying but enjoyable job or a high-paying but boring job?  
GR: Is the salary high?  
HQ: Why is that important?  
GR: Without money, many compromises are necessary.  
HQ: Isn't it challenging to do a boring job five days a week?  
GR: A good salary would be motivating.  
HQ: So, money is the primary factor?  
GR: Yes. A job that's only enjoyable can exploit motivation.  
HQ: It's a significant issue nowadays.  
GR: Fun activities can be hobbies.  
HQ: True.  
GR: Which would you pick?  
HQ: If I can support myself, I'd choose a fun job.  
GR: Even with a lower salary?  
HQ: Yes, I need enjoyment to avoid feeling down.  
GR: Understood.  
HQ: I might consider a high-paying job if I could earn a lot.  
GR: There's always a risk of regret with either choice.  
HQ: Do regrets usually stem from missed experiences?  
GR: Desperate times change priorities.  
HQ: Agreed.  
GR: Illness or an economic downturn can make any job valuable.  
HQ: It's worrying to think of another financial crisis.  
GR: Job layoffs are frightening.  
HQ: We should develop technical skills and competencies.  
GR: Connections are crucial too.  
HQ: Absolutely, connections matter.  
GR: Yes.",4
5,"HQ: Good evening.
GR: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
HQ: Today was difficult because of a hangover.
GR: Did you consume alcohol yesterday?
HQ: Yes, I drank quite a bit after a long break.
GR: Hangovers can be quite challenging.
HQ: I lost the whole morning, which is unfortunate since it’s the last day of the long weekend.
GR: It seems like a missed opportunity.
HQ: I feel like I wasted something important.
GR: Have you considered an amino acid supplement from Ajinomoto? It helps with hangovers.
HQ: Is there such a product?
GR: Yes, you might find it useful.
HQ: I will look into it.
GR: Please do, it could help.
HQ: I didn’t used to get hangovers, but now my age seems to be affecting me.
GR: Have you observed any changes in your liver function?
HQ: The numbers are not as good as they used to be.
GR: Reducing alcohol intake might be beneficial.
HQ: I thought about it but still ended up drinking yesterday.
GR: Was there a specific reason?
HQ: No specific reason, just found a drink I liked at the store.
GR: It might tempt you to drink more.
HQ: I ended up drinking a lot.
GR: What type of alcohol was it?
HQ: It was sake.
GR: Drinking a lot of sake can be hard on your system.
HQ: Yes, it’s not the best way to drink.
GR: Do you require any further assistance?
HQ: No, thank you.
GR: Noted.",6
6,"HQ: Good evening.
GR: Good evening.
HQ: Do you have a partner?
GR: Not active here for a year.
HQ: Prioritize appearance or personality?
GR: Appearance initially.
HQ: Is appearance a deal-breaker?
GR: Yes, there are limits.
HQ: Clothes and hairstyles can change, body shape is harder.
GR: Body shape is harder to change quickly.
HQ: I dated someone overweight before.
GR: Did she lose weight?
HQ: No, we broke up after a year.
GR: Losing weight is difficult.
HQ: Eating was part of my job.
GR: That complicates things.
HQ: We could have eaten less.
GR: Was weight an issue for the breakup?
HQ: It was a factor.
GR: Understood.
HQ: Weight gain can continue.
GR: True, harder with age.
HQ: It affected the relationship.
GR: Appearance matters.
HQ: Some have thick beards.
GR: Consider hair removal.
HQ: Shaving issues, hair removal is better.
GR: Correct.
HQ: Beard removal is painful.
GR: Understood.",14
7,"HQ: Hello.
GR: Hello, how can I assist you today?
HQ: Are you going on a trip?
GR: ""I don't go very often, but it seems to be cheaper.""
HQ: It seems like the government is going to launch some kind of campaign.
GR: Is it different from the GOTO Travel program?
HQ: I haven't fully researched it yet, but it might be different.
GR: ""Did you go anywhere during the GOTO Travel campaign?""
HQ: I haven't traveled, but I did stay at a hotel.
GR: Has it become cheaper?
HQ: I was able to stay for about 2000 yen per night.
GR: That's quite affordable.
HQ: However, I could only use it once, so I wish I had used it more.
GR: ""Then, I want to make use of it this time.""
HQ: I see. I might want to go to a hot spring.
GR: Hot springs are nice. It's also getting colder around this time of year.
HQ: It has become the perfect season, hasn't it?
GR: Autumn weather can be unstable, so you might end up taking an open-air bath in the rain.
HQ: ""Well, that might be a good experience in its own way?""
GR: ""Is it possible that outdoor hot spring baths will be banned in the first place?""
HQ: On drizzly days we could normally get in, but I wonder how it would be in heavy rain.
GR: The hot water seems to get cold, doesn't it?
HQ: Right.
GR: If you were to go to a hot spring, where would you like to go?
HQ: Since sightseeing seems tiring, I prefer a place where I can focus solely on the hot springs.
GR: ""Then it seems like a place where you can enjoy various hot springs would be better than a sightseeing spot.""
HQ: I see. There will probably be fewer people if we don't go the mainstream route.
GR: ""If it's not the royal road, then where would it be?""
HQ: Well, I'm sure every prefecture has one.
GR: Certainly, that’s true.",1

GR: Hello  
HQ: Do you drive?  
GR: I don't have a license.  
HQ: Want to get one?  
GR: No need in Tokyo.  
HQ: Understood.  
GR: Do you drive?  
HQ: Yes, but not often.  
GR: Want a car?  
HQ: It's useful but costly.  
GR: Good for families.  
HQ: True, but cars aren't my hobby.  
GR: I'll buy one when self-driving is standard.  
HQ: Don't like driving?  
GR: Yes, afraid of accidents.  
HQ: Accidents are likely.  
GR: Especially fatal ones.  
HQ: Serious consequence.  
GR: Indeed.  
HQ: Even if it's a pedestrian's fault, the driver is blamed.  
GR: That's what I don't like.  
HQ: It's unfair.  
GR: Agreed.  
HQ: Even if someone jumps out, the driver is blamed.  
GR: Relatives might blame you too.  
HQ: Yes, could be traumatizing.  
GR: Impressive people manage to drive.  
HQ: They say you get used to it.  
GR: Adapting varies for everyone.",12
