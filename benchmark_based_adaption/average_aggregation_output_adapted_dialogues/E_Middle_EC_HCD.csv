1,"EC: Hello  
DG: Hello!  
EC: Recently, cooking every day has become quite difficult. Do you have any easy and frequently made dishes to recommend?  
DG: I've been eating somen noodles a lot lately. I've been trying different variations.  
EC: What kinds of variations can you do with somen?  
DG: You can try minced meat miso, like in tantanmen, or with tomatoes for an Italian twist.  
EC: Do you add things like meat miso and tantanmen directly on top of the somen noodles?  
DG: Yes, that's right. Sometimes I prepare it in advance, and for tantanmen, I use store-bought options.  
EC: Changing the flavor seems like it would keep somen noodles interesting.  
DG: I also tried a chijimi (Korean pancake) recipe from COOKPAD. It was good.  
EC: Do you mix it with flour and bake it?  
DG: I finely chopped boiled somen and added potato starch. It turned out chewy.  
EC: That sounds nice. I'll give it a shot next time.  
DG: Adding leftover green onions also worked well.  
EC: Green onions are great. Thanks.  
DG: You're welcome. COOKPAD makes it easy to cook anything.  
EC: Do you ever have any misses with COOKPAD?  
DG: Sometimes. I think it's because I don't follow the measurements strictly.  
EC: I often pick the wrong recipes and hesitate to try new things.  
DG: Have you had any particular failures?  
EC: The biggest failure was a rice cooker cake with canned peaches; it turned out mushy.  
DG: That sounds unfortunate.  
EC: It was quite a shock, though it was likely due to my method.  
DG: It might depend on the rice cooker.  
EC: Expecting to eat cake and being let down is quite disappointing.  
DG: You can't check progress with a rice cooker.  
EC: Also, a cheesecake made with pizza cheese turned out poorly.  
DG: You make a lot of sweets.  
EC: I'll avoid recipes that seem likely to fail and aim for success.  
DG: That's a good approach.",3
2,"EC: Hello!
DG: Hello!  
EC: Do you have any siblings?  
DG: No, I am an only child.  
EC: Understood. When I was younger, I admired being an only child.  
DG: How many siblings do you have?  
EC: I have one younger sister. We used to argue a lot, but we get along well now.  
DG: Noted. Being alone as an adult can be lonely.  
EC: Would you prefer a sister if you had siblings? My sister wanted an older brother.  
DG: Possessiveness could be a concern.  
EC: You might feel jealous of your brother's partner.  
DG: My friend finds it troublesome to be close with their single brother.  
EC: Being too close can be problematic. It might make it seem like there's no need for a romantic partner.  
DG: They spend time playing games and reading manga together. I'm concerned.  
EC: Noted.  
DG: Do you often meet your younger sister?  
EC: We live three hours apart by bullet train, so we don't meet often. But we stay in touch through LINE.  
DG: It must be challenging being far apart. Good to stay in touch.  
EC: Yes, it's enjoyable! Our family has a daughter and a son. Their future relationship is intriguing.  
DG: Indeed. Young people today seem less inclined toward marriage. A good sibling relationship is valuable.  
EC: I want them to get along, but seeing them fight sometimes makes me worry about their future relationship.  
DG: My friend used to fight with their sibling but changed over time.  
EC: That's surprising. I imagined the older brother always caring for his little sister.  
DG: Growing up is remarkable.  
EC: People change as they grow.  
DG: Considering having children, two seems ideal.  
EC: I see! If you have the means and energy, a larger family sounds lively.  
DG: Definitely. Costs of dining and outings are significant.  
EC: Noted. Thank you very much!  
DG: You're welcome.",12
3,"EC: Hello! Nice to meet you.
AF: Greetings.
EC: When I was parking, I accidentally hit the car and my mood dropped.
AF: That's unfortunate. Was it a new car?
EC: No, it was a used car from the beginning. But I'm worried about the repair costs.
AF: Is the damage extensive?
EC: It's not very big, but even to an amateur, it's clear that the parts are misaligned.
AF: Visible damage can be concerning.
EC: That's right. I'm also worried that the parts might slip and fall off.
AF: I understand. I had similar experiences when I was learning to drive.
EC: It's your parent's car, right? Did you get scolded?
AF: I initially claimed it was hit while parked.
EC: Understood.
AF: They knew it was me.
EC: Will it be found out?
AF: They believed I caused it because I was a new driver.
EC: Parental intuition is strong.
AF: I caused a significant accident, leaving the door mirror hanging.
EC: The mirrors hang down, huh. If it were a new car, I'd probably turn pale.
AF: I was very pale at that moment.
EC: Certainly, it must have been tough for your parents too.
AF: Any plans for a drive soon?
EC: I don't have plans to go for a drive. Do you?
AF: I'm thinking of an overnight trip during the latter part of summer vacation.
EC: Sounds good.
AF: I usually stay at places without meals and find local restaurants.
EC: That sounds enjoyable.
AF: Saving on hotel costs and enjoying the trip is efficient.
EC: I understand. Thank you for today.
AF: You are welcome.",2
4,"EC: Hello, thank you for your time today.  
AF: You're welcome. How can I assist you?  
EC: Corona is scary, isn't it?  
AF: Yes, it is. Wearing a mask in the heat can be tough.  
EC: Definitely! It feels like I'm going to get heatstroke.  
AF: Heatstroke is a concern. Going out with a mask in hot weather can be risky.  
EC: Without a mask, it might be a tough summer, don't you think?  
AF: The number of people wearing masks outdoors has decreased slightly.  
EC: Perhaps, but in rural areas, many still wear masks due to concerns about COVID-19.  
AF: In rural areas, the percentage of elderly people wearing masks has decreased.  
EC: Understood. It's changing gradually, isn't it?  
AF: I recently stopped wearing a mask outdoors and feel less conscious of being watched.  
EC: That must help reduce the worry about heatstroke.  
AF: This year was very hot, so I bought a parasol for children.  
EC: Children feel the heat too. Do many use parasols when commuting to school?  
AF: A few classmates have them.  
EC: It must be tough commuting in the heat.  
AF: In the morning it's fine, but I use a parasol when returning home.  
EC: It's hottest then. It's good you have a parasol to stay cooler.  
AF: Yes, children's parasols are light. I recommend them.  
EC: I'll check them out next time!  
AF: Definitely, they cost less than 2,000 yen.  
EC: That's good! Are you doing anything else to prevent heatstroke?  
AF: I use a cooling towel around my neck every day.  
EC: I've never used a cooling towel. Does it make your neck wet?  
AF: You wet and wring it out. It dries quickly in summer.  
EC: That sounds effective.  
AF: I bought it for children, but it's comfortable for adults too.  
EC: Understood. Thank you for the information.  
AF: You're welcome.",2
5,"EC: Hello, nice to meet you!
AF: Hello, how can I assist you today?
EC: I've been thinking about cleaning up the house, but I can't seem to get started.
AF: Which areas are you looking to clean up?
EC: There are toys and children's clothes that are no longer used. They hold memories, so it's hard to throw them away.
AF: Understood. Many people keep items like that for sentimental reasons.
EC: Do you have any regrets about throwing away unexpected things?
AF: Yes, but I usually take a photo before disposing of them.
EC: Photos are a good idea. That way, it's easier to remember them.
AF: Taking a photo while holding new items or artwork helps.
EC: It's a good idea to have the person hold it. Do you also take photos of crafts before disposing of them?
AF: Yes, I keep an album for such works. It's easy to look through it later.
EC: An album sounds great! I've thought about making one but haven't started yet.
AF: The key is to avoid accumulation. I place an order online immediately after taking the photos.
EC: I'm impressed by how quickly you get things done. Do you order immediately and store the photos as soon as they arrive?
AF: Yes, I give the artwork to the child and then dispose of it when it breaks.
EC: Thatâ€™s very helpful. Have you ever faced any issues for secretly throwing things away?
AF: Most people value the creation process more than the item itself.
EC: The peak of crafting is indeed when you finish making it.
AF: Correct. Sometimes, the process itself is the most enjoyable part.
EC: Especially with things like paper clay, right? I might start taking photos and then disposing of them.
AF: I recommend it. It helps keep the home tidy.
EC: A comfortable home is important. The children's room is so messy that just entering it can be disheartening.
AF: Sometimes, giving them a garbage bag and asking them to throw away unnecessary items works well.
EC: It's amazing that they'll throw things away! At our house, everything has memories, so we find it hard to let go.
AF: I tend to throw things away often, and my child might have adopted this habit.
EC: The way of tidying up seems to run in the family. My parents also have a hard time throwing things away.
AF: My mother was also the type to throw things away.
EC: Thank you for sharing such valuable insights.
AF: You're welcome. Glad to be of help.",2
6,"EC: Hello, nice to meet you.
AF: Hello, how can I assist you today?
EC: I'm thinking about buying a new computer. Can you provide the specs of your computer?
AF: I don't have exact specs, but it's running the latest version of Windows.
EC: Understood. I often experience issues with devices freezing or slow updates, which is frustrating.
AF: I usually buy affordable used computers, often for tens of thousands of yen.
EC: You buy second-hand? How do you choose where to buy it?
AF: I check prices on the Rakuten store and then have my husband confirm before purchasing.
EC: Your husband knows a lot about computers! It's good to have someone to check with.
AF: I rely on my husband for detailed specifications.
EC: At my place, I need to choose myself since I use it frequently.
AF: Consulting with a store might help you make a better decision.
EC: That makes sense. Consulting with a store might reduce the chances of making a mistake.
AF: Smartphones have high specs nowadays, and it can be confusing to choose.
EC: There are so many options. Iâ€™m interested in trying Google Pixel.
AF: I recently replaced my smartphone.
EC: Which smartphone did you switch to?
AF: I got the latest 5G model from Tone Mobile, but I'm not clear on what 5G offers.
EC: I've heard about 5G too, but it doesn't seem to be a game-changer yet.
AF: I haven't noticed much difference, except it runs smoother than my old phone.
EC: Since it's 5G, you'd expect even faster speeds, right?
AF: Does 5G affect speed? I wasn't aware of that.
EC: I thought so, but I'm not entirely sure.
AF: The cameras on modern smartphones take surprisingly good photos.
EC: I agree! But my phone's zoom function is disappointing because it's a cheaper model.
AF: For serious photography, I use a digital single-lens reflex camera instead of a smartphone.
EC: It's important to use the right tool for the right job.
AF: I don't keep up with new technologies much.
EC: Same here. Thank you for your help!
AF: You're welcome. Thank you!",1
7,"EC: Hello!
AF: Hello, how can I assist you today?
EC: Have you been watching any TV shows or anime recently?
AF: Yes, I'm currently watching Naruto and Bleach.
EC: Those are popular shows. I'd like to watch them too.
AF: Both have been adapted into long-running anime series.
EC: Are the anime series still ongoing?
AF: Naruto's anime adaptation is complete.
EC: That's helpful to know. I want to start watching it.
AF: The main character in Naruto is very popular.
EC: Does Naruto have a sequel series?
AF: Yes, it's called 'Boruto: Naruto Next Generations.'
EC: I wonder who Naruto marries.
AF: I won't spoil it for you. I recently started watching Bleach.
EC: The concept of Bankai is impressive.
AF: Jujutsu Kaisen is currently trending, but I prefer Bleach.
EC: I haven't seen Jujutsu Kaisen, but Bleach has distinctive characters.
AF: I got hooked on Bleach quickly and want to watch the movies too.
EC: There are movies as well? I didn't know that.
AF: Yes, the movies feature Fukushi-kun and Hana-chan in the lead roles.
EC: I want to see it. It should be available on Friday Roadshow.
AF: It is available on Netflix as well.
EC: I don't have Netflix, but I'll find a way to watch it. Thank you.
AF: You're welcome. Thank you too.",5
8,"EC: Good evening!
AF: Good evening!
EC: Do you have your air conditioner cleaned every year? It seems quite costly.
AF: I don't do it every year; it's about once every three years.
EC: That sounds reasonable. I was unsure because the company advised annual cleaning.
AF: It's about time, but rather, it's time to replace the air conditioner.
EC: Air conditioners are pricey, aren't they?
AF: I sometimes think that cleaning on my own with a spray I bought is enough.
EC: I've noticed those sprays at the pharmacy. Do they work well?
AF: I haven't tried it yet. I'm a little concerned it might break.
EC: That's understandable, you wouldn't want it to break.
AF: Somehow, I'd prefer to do the maintenance myself rather than outsourcing it.
EC: That makes sense. Saving money is always good.
AF: The more things you can do on your own, the more you can save.
EC: I agree! Do you find you're good at saving money?
AF: I'm not great at saving in small ways, so instead, I invest.
EC: You're into investing? Is it something like NISA?
AF: Yes, I am investing in both NISA and iDeCo, but within the limits of my savings and deposits.
EC: That's impressive. How did you learn about it?
AF: From books, and then I learned it while managing it.
EC: So you read and then practiced? Weren't you worried about losses?
AF: In actual shopping, there are times when you make mistakes and lose out. That's how I feel.
EC: That's insightful! It puts my mind at ease.
AF: Since it's within my own financial means, even if I lose money, it won't be a significant amount.
EC: I see. Keeping it to an acceptable amount sounds wise.
AF: I think so. And I am overwhelmingly bad at regular shopping and often fail.
EC: I understand. I'm feeling interested in investing now.
AF: While I can't easily recommend it, investing in Rakuten Points has low risk and is easy to start.
EC: I've heard about investing with Rakuten Points! I'll definitely look into it. Thank you!
AF: You're welcome, and thank you!",1
