1,"AX: Good evening.
AN: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
AX: Do you drink alcohol often?
AN: Yes, I do. How about you?
AX: Occasionally. I recently found an interesting bar.
AN: Please describe it.
AX: The patrons were mostly elderly, in their 70s or older.
AN: That's unusual.
AX: Their conversations were noteworthy. One woman needed stitches after a fall.
AN: That sounds serious. Is she okay now?
AX: Yes, but it was concerning.
AN: Falls can be dangerous at that age.
AX: The bartender seemed young compared to the patrons.
AN: Interesting observation.
AX: It was. I was cautious when I left.
AN: Safety is important.
AX: We need to be careful as we get older.
AN: Definitely. My husband once broke a tooth while drunk.
AX: That's risky. Be careful.
AN: We will. Thank you.",65
2,"AX: Thanks for your efforts. Excited to collaborate with you.  
AN: Thank you for your hard work. Please handle it properly.

AN: Beer and wine.  
AX: I enjoy standing wine bars.  
AN: I haven't been drinking outside much lately.  
AX: Since moving to Osaka, I haven't either. Only went twice to a unique bar.  
AN: Unusual to find such bars?  
AX: I went back to check it again.  
AN: An unexpected second visit?  
AX: It piqued my curiosity, so I went again.  
AN: Anything interesting the second time?  
AX: Same type of customers. Seems to attract regulars.  
AN: A bar for older regulars?  
AX: It felt odd since it was my first bar visit in Osaka in a while.  
AN: Don't be discouraged, many great bars are out there.  
AX: Really? Hard to believe.  
AN: Osaka has fantastic spots. Kyoto has great bars too.  
AX: Kyoto has a unique vibe.  
AN: Many bars with a great atmosphere. A whiskey bar in Kyoto was amazing.  
AX: Sounds authentic. I'd love to visit.  
AN: Visit if you get the chance.  
AX: I plan to explore more. Haven't been to Kyoto much.  
AN: COVID-19 made going out difficult.  
AX: Yes. Most shops were closed, didn’t feel like going out.  
AN: Most stores had their shutters down.  
AX: Yeah. Recently felt like going out, but with cases rising, it's tricky.  
AN: Things seemed to get back to normal.  
AX: That's right. Drinking at home is more common now.  
AN: Same here. Hopefully, daily life returns soon.",4
3,"AX: Good evening. Thank you.
BG: Good evening. The equipment from Kamakura Seisakusho is expensive.
AX: It looks heavy.
BG: Yes, it is.
AX: Understood. Can I change the topic?
BG: Yes.
AX: Any recent interviews at work?
BG: No.
AX: I interviewed someone funny once.
BG: Tell me more.
AX: She was 27. Her most enjoyable job was being a shrine maiden.
BG: Interesting.
AX: Yes. Something unusual happened then.
BG: What was it?
AX: Snot was dripping from her nose.
BG: Why?
AX: I didn’t ask.
BG: Noted.
AX: She wanted to continue as a shrine maiden.
BG: Why apply here?

BG: Outcome?
AX: Another was hired. Addressed through sales.
BG: Understood.",7
4,"AX: Good evening. Thanks in advance.
BG: Good evening. Are you afraid of anything?
AX: I try to be mindful of my words.
BG: I mean like ghosts or spooky stories.
AX: Oh, those? Is your sister afraid of them?
BG: No, but your language is fine.
AX: In Hakodate, people were influenced by Aomori culture.
BG: Like a religion?
AX: No, it’s about Itako. Are you concerned about that?
BG: Itako... That's scary. I get frightened easily.
AX: It's better not to be too curious.
BG: I'm more scared of the darkness after those stories.
AX: Yes, it’s unsettling. Such professionals can be intimidating.
BG: Have you met such people? Were you okay?
AX: Some people saw things and got scared; they even went to the hospital.
BG: That seems like a different kind of fear. It's unfamiliar to me.
AX: You can avoid it by being mindful of what you see and hear.
BG: What do you mean?
AX: Watching negative news can make you feel down.
BG: Yes, it does.
AX: News about rising prices and uncertainty can be really depressing.
BG: I stopped watching the news because it made me anxious.
AX: It's important to be cautious about what we take in daily.
BG: Understood.
AX: No problem. Information comes in like push notifications nowadays.
BG: There's so much I don't want to see that I avoid TV.
AX: Same here. We used to choose our own books and things. I worry about the kids too.
BG: I feel uneasy about a world where everything is online. We need balance.
AX: That's right. If you get tired eyes from the screen, it’s not good.
BG: Got it.",14
5,"AX: Good evening. Ready to start working together?
BG: Good evening. Ready.
AX: Have we talked about AI before?
BG: No, we haven't.
AX: Understood. Do you use AI regularly?
BG: No, I don't.
AX: AI chatbots became common during COVID-19.
BG: I use them often.
AX: The ""Do you need help?"" feature is on many websites now.
BG: Yes, it's common.
AX: It was bad in Japanese but has improved.
BG: Still some issues.
AX: They probably use cheaper systems.
BG: Higher quality ones are better.
AX: IBM's Watson is a common base for top chatbots.
BG: Watson is reliable.
AX: In Japan, Pepper-kun uses Watson inside.
BG: Seen Pepper in restaurants. Expensive to implement.
AX: Proper implementation costs millions.
BG: Large-scale integration is costly.
AX: They start with around 300 samples, using machine learning and deep learning.
BG: These methods enhance accuracy.
AX: Machine learning is like listening.
BG: It mimics listening.
AX: Deep learning differentiates contexts, like meanings of ""kiku.""
BG: Context is key for understanding.
AX: It processes binary data to make decisions.
BG: Fundamental to AI.
AX: AI has great potential.
BG: Yes, it does.",9
6,"AX: Good evening. Ready to work today?
AG: Good evening. Yes, I am.
AX: Many prefer cold things in summer. Do you?

AX: I prefer cold things in summer and warm things in winter. Do you eat ice cream?
AG: I try to avoid cold things but still eat ice cream. What about you?
AX: I eat ice cream too. There's an AI Expo here.
AG: Is it an event with various kinds of ice cream?
AX: Yes, ice cream from all over Japan, after three years. Are you interested in such events?
AG: It sounds interesting! Did you go?
AX: I went today. They had waffle cones with soft serve.
AG: Sounds good. But you can't eat too much, right?
AX: Right. I could only eat one, but there were many options. Any favorites you'd have?
AG: It's hard to choose just one. Yamanashi's fruit sherbets sound nice.
AX: Exactly. They had one with mandarin oranges and whipped ice cream.
AG: That sounds unique. What else did they have?
AX: They also had macaron ice, which was popular. Think they'll sell it at convenience stores?
AG: That would be convenient. I hope they do!",7

AG: Good evening. Ready to assist.
AX: Do you prefer hot drinks?
AG: Warm drinks. You?
AX: Either is fine. Do you drink coffee?
AG: Yes, 1 or 2 cups a day.
AX: I see. I recently spoke with the CEO of Starbucks Japan.
AG: Interesting.
AX: He said 7-Eleven coffee is delicious.
AG: Noted.
AX: He mentioned empathy among staff is up to each person.
AG: Was that helpful?
AX: If someone has an accident nearby, the clerk might give a free drink.

AX: Yes, it seems so.
AG: Noted.
AX: A while ago, when I went to Starbucks, I was impressed by something.
AG: What was it?
AX: A young girl who could only communicate in writing, likely because she was deaf, was a store clerk.
AG: Noted.
AX: She had a menu with cute illustrations to point at.
AG: Understood.
AX: The surrounding clerks helped only when she was in trouble.
AG: Noted.
AX: As a customer, I felt grateful.
AG: Positive customer service fosters a good environment.",11

AG: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
AX: Have you noticed shaved ice being sold during summer?
AG: Yes, I recently purchased some.
AX: Did you enjoy eating it?

AX: What kind of shaved ice was it?
AG: It had clear ice and homemade syrup from a cake shop.
AX: That's interesting. There's a shaved ice shop nearby as well.
AG: Have you visited it?
AX: Not yet. It's from a dumpling shop.
AG: What makes their shaved ice unique?
AX: Shaved ice nowadays comes with various toppings.
AG: I see. Go on.
AX: It’s topped with three-colored dumplings.
AG: That’s fitting for a dango shop.
AX: Yes, it's unique and quite intriguing.
AG: Is it like shiratama?
AX: I like white dumplings, but this one has three colors.
AG: Any other toppings included?
AX: No, but they offer fluffy and creamy variations.
AG: Influenced by Taiwanese shaved ice?
AX: Exactly. Have you tried Taiwanese shaved ice?
AG: I've seen it on TV but haven't tasted it. The mango flavor looks appealing.
AX: The presentation is impressive.
AG: Flavoring the ice itself is a novel idea.
AX: They actually flavor the ice? That's new to me.
AG: Yes, it keeps the ice fluffy and prevents it from melting quickly. I'd love to try it sometime.
AX: Got it. Thanks for sharing that.
AG: You're welcome.",13
