IM: Yes, it is. Are you doing anything to cope with the heat?  
HW: I've been using a cool towel that chills when wet.  
IM: What is a cool ring?

IM: That sounds useful.  
HW: Yes, the towel wets my neck, but the ring doesn't.  
IM: Wet clothes and bulky luggage are problems for me too.  
HW: Yes, carrying a lot in summer is inconvenient.  
IM: Traveling with lots of luggage is troublesome.  
HW: Compact luggage would be nice. Bringing your favorite drink helps.  
IM: Any recommendations?  
HW: I like jasmine tea or flavored tea powder. You might not like it.  
IM: What is flavored tea powder?  
HW: It's a powder with apple and vanilla that you mix with water.  
IM: That sounds convenient. I switched to water.  
HW: Water is healthy. Do you prefer hard or soft water?  
IM: I find hard water unpleasant.  
HW: Hard water isn't good for tea and feels different.  
IM: We had both types at home.  
HW: That's nice! People who drink hard water often focus on beauty.  
IM: True, hard water is good for cooking.  
HW: I didn't know that. Water is interesting.
