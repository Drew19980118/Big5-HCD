1,"GA: Please!
CB: How can I assist you?
GA: Do you play any games?
CB: No, but my kids play Minecraft.
GA: Only Minecraft? So we can't play together?
CB: One plays on PC, the other on an iPad.
GA: Are they in elementary school?
CB: Yes, one is in sixth grade, the other in first grade.
GA: Do all kids have iPads now?
CB: My iPad is mainly used by my kids.
GA: So, Minecraft works on an iPad.
CB: Yes, and the younger one likes a Minecraft personality.
GA: Because of the older sibling? I’ve never heard of them.
CB: They are popular, and I bought some merchandise.
GA: That popular, huh?
CB: Yes, my first grader even sleeps with a keychain of them.
GA: I looked it up. Thought they showed their faces.
CB: Only 2 of the 13 members do.
GA: Is it normal for first graders to get hooked?
CB: Mostly fourth or fifth graders. First grade is early.
GA: Fourth grade still feels early. I didn’t use the internet much back then.
CB: Main age range is fourth grade to university. Kids are into 2D characters.
GA: You see new sides of your kids this way.
CB: Yes, the older one matures fast, and the younger one shows advanced behavior.
GA: Check out Sutapora. A friend is a member; your kids might enjoy it!
CB: I’ll inform them.
GA: I sing in the 2D world and do game commentary too!
CB: Viewing now. Many subscribers.
GA: I haven’t supported them much, but they’re doing great.
CB: My child might like Kotaro. Acknowledged.",22
2,"GA: Hello. Nice to meet you.
EO: Hello! Nice to meet you!
GA: Did you have breakfast today?
EO: Yes, I am eating right now.
GA: I am also eating.
EO: What a coincidence. What are you eating?
GA: I am eating rice with raw egg.
EO: That sounds like a nutritious meal.
GA: I added olive oil, wasabi, and used noodle soup base instead of soy sauce. It’s highly recommended.
EO: I have not heard of adding olive oil and wasabi before.
GA: I might be the only one doing it here. I use them because I have a dull sense of taste.
EO: It sounds unique. I might try it next time.
GA: Olive oil alone is delicious too. What are you eating?
EO: Toast, boiled egg, grapes, and pumpkin salad.
GA: That sounds stylish.
EO: Thank you. It’s a bit embarrassing.
GA: I mean it. Is the salad leftover from last night?
EO: Yes, it is.
GA: That makes sense. Preparing it in the morning seems like a lot of work.
EO: I agree, making it fresh in the morning would be tough.
GA: I don’t usually cook, so it seems challenging.
EO: Do you cook at all?
GA: I live with my parents, so my mother cooks for me.
EO: That sounds nice.
GA: I am very grateful for her.
EO: Make sure to take care of your mother.
GA: Yes, I should cook sometimes.
EO: Cooking is a useful skill.
GA: I will practice.
EO: Good luck!",1
3,"GA: Good morning.  
EO: Good morning. How can I assist you today?  
GA: What are your hobbies?  
EO: I enjoy reading.  
GA: What types of books do you prefer?  
EO: Novels and parenting books.  
GA: I don't read often. Should I start?  
EO: Reading is a personal choice.  
GA: I prefer watching anime.  
EO: What anime have you watched?  
GA: I recently watched BLEACH.  
EO: BLEACH is well-known.  
GA: Yes, it’s an older series.  
EO: I collected the paperback versions.  
GA: It’s popular with certain generations.  
EO: The rescue of Rukia is memorable.  
GA: I’ve only seen up to the Arrancar arc. It’s intense.  
EO: The Arrancar arc is significant.  
GA: I often quoted BLEACH lines to my friends.  
EO: Like ""Bankai""?  
GA: Yes, exactly.  
EO: Understood.  
GA: I still feel young at heart.  
EO: Staying young at heart is good.  
GA: My friends agree.  
EO: Noted.  
GA: I’ll remember that.  
EO: Noted.",12
4,"GA: Thank you in advance!
EO: Nice to meet you. I listened to your song.
GA: Thanks.
EO: It sounded nice. Is this Kansai dialect?
GA: Yes, it is. I made it with Yashiki Takajin in mind because I'm from Kansai.
EO: I see. I am from Kansai too.
GA: I'm glad you listened.
EO: Impressive. Will you become a composer?
GA: Maybe in the future.
EO: Do you work on it daily?
GA: It varies. Lately, I lack motivation.
EO: Do your parents know about the music?
GA: No, they don't.
EO: Is it a secret?
GA: Yes, I don't discuss much with them.
EO: Understood.
GA: I shared a lot when I was little but stopped in junior high.
EO: Is it the same with your father?
GA: I avoid telling him unless necessary.
EO: Understood. Is he stricter?
GA: He's mellowed with age.
EO: Parents mellow with age. Is he strict-looking?
GA: Maybe a bit.
EO: We got disciplined for improper seating during meals.
GA: Scary. My dad once threw a cabbage at me.
EO: Why cabbage?
GA: It was nearby.
EO: Understood.",8
5,"GA: Hi.
EO: Hello.
GA: Can you share your family experiences?
EO: That is challenging.
GA: Apologies for asking.
EO: Are you referring to your current family?
GA: Yes, my current family.
EO: Understood.
GA: Do your children participate in activities or lessons?
EO: Art class and mini-basketball.
GA: Is mini-basketball similar to regular basketball?
EO: Yes.
GA: Are you athletic?
EO: No.
GA: Are they finding it difficult?
EO: No, I enjoy it.
GA: They might become sporty. Is this the same child who goes to art class?
EO: The eldest and second son go to art class. Mini-basketball is for the eldest.
GA: Understood. I used to quit lessons.
EO: Did you attend any classes?
GA: Abacus, English, and cram school. Only English continued.
EO: Are you good at English?
GA: Just pronunciation.
EO: I didn't like studying.
GA: I took English classes because a friend went too.
EO: Noted.
GA: I wish I had become fluent in English.
EO: Did you manage to become fluent?",14
6,"GA: Please!
EO: Thank you!
GA: What music do you listen to?
EO: Anime theme songs recently.
GA: Are they recent?
EO: Yes, like mixed nuts and Habit.
GA: I don't follow those much.
EO: My child watches Spy x Family. I'm rewatching Naruto.
GA: Does Naruto take a lot of time?
EO: Orochimaru is fighting the Third Hokage now.
GA: That's early in the series.
EO: I've watched a bit.
GA: Excluding fillers, it might take 2-3 years.
EO: Really?
GA: It was broadcast for 15 years.
EO: That's surprising.
GA: Taking it slow is fine.
EO: I'll do that. When did you become a shut-in?
GA: Since the COVID-19 emergency.
EO: That's recent.
GA: I slacked off since junior high, dropped out, and couldn't keep a job.
EO: I see.
GA: Yeah.
EO: I used to be late often too.
GA: If I was going to be late, I just didn't go.
EO: I was late but still went, usually by lunch.
GA: Should have done that. Reflection papers were a hassle.
EO: Agreed.
GA: Things might have been different without that system.
EO: Understood.",24
7,"GA: Please!  
EO: Nice to meet you.  
GA: What kind of part-time jobs have you done so far?  
EO: ""Izakaya, convenience store, family restaurant, home tutor, cram school teacher, cabaret club, apparel.""  
GA: ""They're all customer service jobs, aren't they? It must be tough if you're shy.""  
EO: Understood. Handling customer service can be challenging if you are introverted.  
GA: But I kind of understand that feeling. It's like you can talk more easily because they're a complete stranger, right?  
EO: Affirmative. Interacting with customers can be easier since they are different individuals each time.  
GA: That's right. When I worked part-time at a call center, I felt like my vocabulary improved and I could speak more clearly.  
EO: Noted. Working at a call center can enhance communication skills.  
GA: I remember being surprised at how unexpectedly easy it was when I tried working at a call center. It took a while to get used to the manual though.  
EO: Acknowledged. Learning the manual can take some time.  
GA: ""I think it depends on the place, but the call center I worked at was to support the staff, not the customers, so there weren't many complaints.""  
EO: Understood. Different call centers have varied functions and responsibilities.  
GA: ""I felt like I had something like that too.""  
EO: Understood. Please specify what other part-time jobs you have done.  
GA: Warehouse work, stocking shelves at a supermarket, also at a bread factory, game bug testing (I quit both of those in one day), I guess.  
EO: Confirmed. Your work experience seems to involve behind-the-scenes roles.  
GA: As far as I remember, I think it was mostly back-office work. So at first, before going to the call center, I had quite a bit of resistance.  
EO: Understood. Switching to a customer-facing role can be challenging.  
GA: I had never worked in customer service before, so I was extremely nervous, but I got used to it in less than a month.  
EO: Noted. Adapting to new roles can occur within a short period.  
GA: The call center job was the most recent and the one that lasted the longest. I was often praised at work, and I got along well with the employees too.  
EO: Confirmed. Positive feedback and good relationships with colleagues contributed to the longevity of your role.  
GA: The reason for quitting almost every part-time job is ""I lost to myself.""  
EO: Please clarify.  
GA: I'm sorry. I might just not be a morning person, but often my body wouldn't move before going to work.  
EO: Understood. Difficulty in starting the day could indicate underlying stress.  
GA: I don't think I'm stressed, but even though things should be going well, I suddenly stop.  
EO: Noted. Sudden stoppages despite smooth progress can be perplexing.  ",1
8,"GA: Please!
EO: Thank you in advance!
GA: Were you considered smart because you were tutoring and working at a cram school?
EO: I am only good at Japanese.
GA: Is it possible to have a part-time teaching job focusing only on Japanese?
EO: Yes, just teaching Japanese was fine.
GA: I thought you had to be good at all subjects.
EO: At cram schools, there are fixed times for Japanese and math.
GA: So, there were teachers who only handled math too.
EO: Correct. Tutors for elementary students might teach multiple subjects.
GA: If you could add exercise, it would be perfect.
EO: Unfortunately, exercise is not included.
GA: Everyone has some shortcomings. I wanted to try being a teacher.
EO: Have you considered teaching English?
GA: I felt embarrassed about saying I could speak English.
EO: What was your deviation score?
GA: The high school I entered was ranked around 47.
EO: Understood, 47.
GA: It was a regular high school, with no real delinquents.
EO: My high school was around 55. I got about 65 in Japanese.
GA: 60 seems enjoyable. To be 65, you must be very good!
EO: But I couldn't reach 70.
GA: People at around 70 start lacking in some areas. It's best to be balanced.
EO: True. My older brother is a researcher and smart, but eccentric.
GA: Surprising news again...
EO: He is researching cancer but has serious personality issues.
GA: Many smart people find communication difficult. It's less of an issue among intelligent people.
EO: Compatibility might be a factor.
GA: If the IQ gap is too wide, communication can be difficult.
EO: I see.",2
