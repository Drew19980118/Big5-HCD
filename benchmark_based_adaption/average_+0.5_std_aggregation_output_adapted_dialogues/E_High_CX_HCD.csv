1,"CX: Hello. How is the COVID-19 situation over there?  
BU: Hello. Are you asking about the infection situation around our area?  
CX: Yes, the situation in your area, such as the number of infections.  
BU: I don't watch the news about COVID-19 anymore. Even if I watch it, nothing changes.  
CX: I see. That might be a good thing. I tend to notice it.  
BU: Even if I'm not conscious of it, it's always being reported. I don't mind it anymore.  
CX: Yes, that's right. It's not good to let it affect your mental health by worrying too much.  
BU: That's right. I think it would be okay as long as I don't cause trouble for others when I'm infected.  
CX: Certainly. If you take preventive measures yourself, there's nothing else you can do about it.  
BU: Okay. Let's stop talking about COVID.  
CX: Understood. Is there any news that you are interested in right now? Preferably something positive.  
BU: I see. Are you referring to the fact that the Chunichi Dragons won yesterday?  
CX: You like baseball, don't you? I'm a Giants fan though. Sorry.  
BU: No, no, not at all. I'm just a baseball fan who supports the Chunichi Dragons.  
CX: Thank you very much. Ohno was amazing yesterday, wasn't he?  
BU: Thank you for knowing. It's a shame about the Giants.  
CX: The pitching staff is not very good, so we tend to lose close games.  
BU: Pitcher Hirauchi. Let's do our best. As for the Giants, I'm cheering for Walker and Nakayama.  
CX: That's right, if the players around there perform well and then Okamoto gets back in form.  
BU: Okamoto was removed from the fourth position. Nakata is doing well right now.  
CX: Okamoto is in quite bad shape. Yesterday, Nakata hit a home run. Quite a contrast.  
BU: He has improved since the game against Chunichi. Nakata was really cool.  
CX: I am very humbled, but I think it is quite good to be able to hit a home run off Rydel.  
BU: This is the first home run of the year. Amazing. Nakata is great too, but that was just poor battery performance.  
CX: I see, the catcher's lead is also a concern for us.  
BU: Many commentators are saying that Kinotaku's leadership is not good this year.  
CX: I see. You really want a good catcher, don't you?  
BU: Yes, that's right. Even if they can't hit or lead well, I want a catcher who can win.  
CX: I want a catcher like Yakult's Nakamura.  
BU: Player Nakamura is a good player, isn't he? It feels like his performance dropped a bit after his jersey number changed. Thank you!",1
2,"CX: Thank you in advance. Are there any long holidays like the Obon holiday?  
BU: There are no long holidays currently scheduled. Is there anything else you need to know?  
CX: I see. I don't have anything in particular either.  
BU: Are you off today?  
CX: Yes, I'm on a break. I lost my job due to COVID-19, so I'm off every day now.  
BU: That must be challenging. Are you currently looking for a new job?  
CX: Yes, but I have some time, so I'm planning to take it slow, maybe study a bit too.  
BU: It's good to go at your own pace. Do you have any preferences for your next job?  
CX: Thank you. I'm considering different options and taking time to think it through.  
BU: I understand. What kind of work did you do before?  
CX: I was a TV assistant director.  
BU: You worked in TV? Was it in Tokyo?  
CX: Yes, in Tokyo.  
BU: Did you work for a well-known TV company?  
CX: It was a production company, so the name might not be familiar.  
BU: I see. Who is the most famous person you have met?  
CX: Probably Banana Man, since we worked together.  
BU: That’s impressive.  
CX: Banana Man is very kind and funny.  
BU: They appear on various TV shows.  
CX: Yes, but Mr. Himura is quite quiet during breaks.  
BU: Many talents are like that.  
CX: Mr. Shitara makes small jokes even during breaks.  
BU: Sounds like a fun environment.  
CX: It is. It's very lively.  
BU: A good atmosphere makes for a good program.  
CX: Exactly. It was tough when the staff didn't get along.  
BU: That sounds difficult.  
CX: I try my best to prevent that from happening.  
BU: It's best to enjoy what you do. Thank you very much!",3
3,"CX: Hello. Any plans for today or tomorrow?
BU: No. Do you?
CX: No, just relaxing.
BU: Have you eaten rice?
CX: I'll have lunch soon.
BU: Decided what to eat?
CX: Pork shabu-shabu.
BU: Nice.
CX: Just boiled pork and bean sprouts.
BU: Do you make the broth yourself?
CX: No, just hot water.
BU: I think of shabu-shabu as a restaurant dish.
CX: I think of it as boiling water with meat and vegetables.
BU: Ponzu?
CX: Grated daikon radish sauce.
BU: With ponzu?
CX: Maybe. Not very ponzu-like.
BU: Refreshing? Like grated daikon radish?
CX: Yes, but I buy it pre-grated.
BU: Easier that way.
CX: Yes. Grilled fish with grated daikon and soy sauce is great.
BU: Good with Atka mackerel.
CX: Better with fatty fish.
BU: I don't often have grilled fish at home.
CX: I eat at set meal restaurants sometimes.
BU: Fish there is good. I'm getting hungry.
CX: What are you having for lunch?
BU: I don't eat lunch.
CX: I see. Have a good day.
BU: Thank you. Goodbye.",11

CX: Preparedness is important.  
CO: Yes, unpreparedness can lead to significant damage.  
CX: My home is on the second floor of an apartment, so I feel somewhat safe.

CX: That sounds bad.  
CO: Yes, I've been more careful since then.  
CX: With climate news about typhoons and heavy rains, I am concerned.  
CO: Is that so? The typhoon is in the Kanto region now, right?

CO: Since it's still ongoing, I'll stay home this time.

CO: Do you have any plans?
CX: I don't have an Obon holiday itself.
CO: Are you working?
CX: No, I'm taking a break from work now. So, I've been off all the time.
CO: I see.
CX: That's right. Also, since this summer is hot, it might be difficult to go outside.
CO: Certainly. It's important to stay safe.
CX: With the coronavirus situation, I'm wondering if I won't be able to do anything this summer.
CO: How long have you been resting?
CX: It has already been about two and a half years.
CO: That is a long time. What was your previous job?
CX: I was working part-time at a gas station, among other jobs.
CO: Juggling multiple jobs must have been busy.
CX: The work itself is easy, but working day and night was really tough.
CO: That sounds challenging. Are you still not looking for a job yet?
CX: Yes. I am currently carefully considering what to do next.
CO: It's a difficult time to move around with the coronavirus situation.
CX: That's really it. There are fewer job openings as well.

AT: It's becoming popular again; medical strain is often reported.  
CX: Emergency services are overwhelmed due to COVID-19 and heatstroke.  
AT: Other illnesses not receiving treatment is a concern.

7,"CX: Good evening. Is it almost time for dinner?
AT: Yes, it is time to start preparing dinner.

CX: Tonight, I’ll have miso soup and canned fish.
AT: Is that the only thing you’ll have?

AT: Could it be due to lack of exercise?

CX: I often wake up at night, making sleep difficult.
AT: Frequent waking can impact sleep quality.
CX: I wish it were cooler or had less temperature variation.
AT: Do you use air conditioning?
CX: I live in Hokkaido and don’t have an air conditioner.
AT: Summers in Hokkaido can be hot.
CX: It was manageable before, but now it’s hotter.

AT: Research heatstroke prevention and better sleep measures.

AT: That’s a good plan.",16
8,"CX: Thank you in advance. Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
AT: Sure. Here is the translated sentence:

AT: I have the same plan. I usually relax on Sundays since I work on Mondays.
CX: What kind of work do you do?
AT: I am a system engineer, mainly doing desk work.

AT: It does become uncomfortable and unpleasant.
CX: They say you shouldn't massage yourself too much, but I end up doing it anyway.

CX: That's essential. I often use a heating pad with adzuki beans.
AT: That's new to me. What is it like?
CX: You heat it in the microwave and place it on your eyes or shoulders.
AT: It seems effective for improving blood circulation.
CX: Yes, and it’s reusable too.
AT: Certainly. Doesn't your body get stiff when reading?
CX: Yes, it does. I do some stretching to loosen up.
AT: Stretching is necessary, but it's hard to do at the office.
CX: Maybe neck turns or arm stretches would be okay?
AT: That should be fine. I'll move around more when working from home.
CX: Can you work from home? Like remote work.
AT: Currently, it's half at the office and half remote.
CX: Is working from home a benefit from the COVID-19 pandemic?
AT: Yes, it cuts down on commute time and rushes.
