AR: Hello. Please let me know how I can assist you today.
ES: I'm feeling a bit nervous.
AR: Do you often feel nervous around new people?
ES: Yes, I do get quite anxious.
AR: I can relate. I manage fine with initial meetings, but I tend to get nervous during important events.
ES: I think that's similar to me! By ""important events,"" do you mean presentations?
AR: Yes, that's correct. I don't do it much now, but when I was younger, I used to write the character for ""people"" (人) on my palm.
ES: That brings back memories!
AR: It seems to be a common practice, right?
ES: I don't remember where I learned it, but I did it too! Also, imagining the audience as potatoes helps.
AR: That's another nostalgic method. It's nice when conversations match shared experiences.
ES: I agree! I wonder if kids today still do things like writing 人人人.
AR: My children are still quite young at 6 and 5 years old, so they don't understand it yet. It would be nice if they did those gestures when they grow older.
ES: Your children are quite young! It would be wonderful if you could teach them.
AR: We currently play games like Alpus Ichiman Shaku and Glico Pineapple Chocolate. It's fun to play together.
ES: Those games are timeless and enjoyable! Do you play outside?
AR: Yes, they prefer being outside, especially with all the extra energy since the coronavirus pandemic.
ES: A friend of mine also mentioned that raising a boy can be challenging due to their high energy levels.
AR: I notice a big difference when I see my child's female classmates; they are usually more calm, drawing or playing house.
ES: There's certainly a noticeable difference in how boys and girls play.
AR: I'd like to try matching outfits with a girl someday. Boys can be quite affectionate too.
ES: Is your child also quite affectionate?
AR: Girls seem more direct with their feelings. Sometimes, they still want to be held.
ES: I see! Being affectionate is indeed adorable.
AR: It definitely brings out my nurturing instincts. I'm sure fathers find their daughters equally charming.
ES: It seems common for mothers to bond well with sons and fathers with daughters. Kids are indeed wonderful.
AR: Their innocence feels refreshing, and it's as if I'm being cleansed. I don't want them to grow up too fast!
ES: The purity of children is truly special.
AR: It is invaluable! See you next time!",1

DN: There are high-speed buses with capsule seats between Aichi, Osaka, and Tokyo.  
ES: Is it completely private?  
DN: The capsule is shaped so you can stretch your legs and offers privacy.

DN: Yes, it’s been popular lately.

DN: No, I just play and then leave!",3
