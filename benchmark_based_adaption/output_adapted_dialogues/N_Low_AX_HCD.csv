AN: Thank you. Please take care.
AX: What kind of alcohol do you like?
AN: Beer and wine.
AX: I enjoy standing wine bars.
AN: I haven't been drinking outside lately.
AX: Since moving to Osaka, I haven't gone out much either. Only twice to a unique bar.
AN: You often find unique bars?
AX: No, I went again to check it out. It caught my interest.
AN: An unexpected second visit!
AX: Yes. I thought it was a coincidence and wanted to see more.
AN: Was the second visit interesting?
AX: The type of customers didn't change.
AN: It must be a bar for older regulars.

AN: There are better bars. Don't be discouraged.
AX: Is that so? It doesn't feel real yet.
AN: Both Osaka and Kyoto have good bars.
AX: Kyoto feels unique. The city's atmosphere is special.
AN: Many bars have a great atmosphere. A whiskey bar in Kyoto was the best.
AX: That sounds authentic. I'd like to visit.
AN: Please do if you get the chance.
AX: Sure. I'll explore more. I haven't been to Kyoto much.
AN: Due to COVID-19, it was tough to go out.
AX: That's right. Most shops were closed in the first year.
AN: Almost all stores had their shutters down.
AX: Recently, I felt like going out, but with cases rising, it's tricky.
AN: It seemed like things were getting better.
AX: That's right. Drinking at home is more common now.
AN: Same here. I hope normal life returns soon.",4
3,"AX: Good evening. Thank you in advance.
BG: Good evening. The equipment from Kamakura Seisakusho is expensive.
AX: If you carry that, it looks heavy.
BG: Yes, it is heavy.
AX: It's true. Can I discuss a different topic?
BG: Yes. Proceed.
AX: Have you recently had an interview or meeting with staff at work?
BG: No recent ones. I remember past ones.
AX: I once interviewed someone who made me laugh.
BG: What happened?
AX: She was a 27-year-old woman. I asked about her most enjoyable job.
BG: Your brother was the interviewer?
AX: Yes, I was there just in case. Guess what she said?
BG: What did she say?
AX: Her most enjoyable job was being a shrine maiden.
BG: A shrine maiden? Unexpected.
AX: Yes. When she answered, something strange happened.
BG: What happened?
AX: Snot was dripping from her nose to her mouth.
BG: Was it hay fever?
AX: I don't know. I couldn't ask.
BG: Understandable.
AX: I then asked what job she wanted next. It was shrine maiden again.
BG: Why apply for your brother's company?
AX: Shrine maidens retire at 26. I didn't know that.
BG: So she can't be a shrine maiden anymore. Passed?
AX: I declined. Another person was hired. I informed the sales department about the runny nose issue.
BG: Noted.",3
4,"AX: Good evening.
BG: Good evening. Is there anything you are afraid of?
AX: Recently, I’ve been cautious with my words to avoid misunderstandings.
BG: I was thinking more about ghosts and such stories.
AX: Oh, like that? Is your sister scary?
BG: Not really. Your language is fine.
AX: In Hakodate, some were influenced by their parents from Aomori.
BG: Like a religion?
AX: No, a job called Itako. Are you worried about such things?
BG: I’ve heard of Itako. It's scary.
AX: It’s best not to be overly scared or curious.
BG: The darkness after such stories is what scares me.
AX: It can be unpleasant. Such professions can be scary.
BG: Have you interacted with them? Were you okay?
AX: Yes, some saw things and were scared, and their son went to the hospital.
BG: That’s an unknown kind of fear.
AX: You can prevent it by being careful with what you see and hear.
BG: What do you mean?
AX: Watching news about Ukraine daily can make you feel down, right?
BG: Yes, it does.
AX: Seeing constant news about rising prices and uncertain futures can also be depressing.
BG: Yes. I stopped watching the news because it made me anxious.
AX: It’s important to be cautious about daily life inputs, including spiritual things.
BG: I see. Thank you.
AX: No problem. Information keeps coming like push notifications.
BG: There’s so much I don't want to see that I’ve come to dislike TV.
AX: Me too. Before, I could choose books myself. I’m worried about the kids.
BG: Yes, I feel uneasy about everything being online. We need balance.
AX: Indeed. Staring at screens can tire your eyes.
BG: Mine too. Hazuki Loupe is my friend.",2

BG: Got it.
AX: Deep learning distinguishes context.
BG: Quite specialized.
AX: It uses 0s and 1s for decisions.
BG: Fascinating.",9
6,"AX: Good evening. I look forward to working with you today.  
AG: Good evening. I look forward to working with you as well.  
AX: Many people prefer cold things in the summer; what about you?  
AG: Cold things can be harmful to the body, so I avoid them.  
AX: Are there warm alternatives you like?  
AG: Yes, I drink soup or room-temperature tea.  
AX: So does it not really matter whether it's summer or winter for you?  
AG: That's correct. How about you?  
AX: In the summer, I enjoy cold things, and in the winter, I prefer warm things.  
AG: Do you also eat ice cream?  
AX: I do eat ice cream. Do you?  
AG: Even though I avoid cold things, I still want to eat ice cream because it's delicious.  
AX: Absolutely. The AI Expo is currently being held in my area.  
AG: Is that an event featuring various kinds of ice cream?  
AX: Yes, ice creams from all over Japan have been gathered for the first time in three years.  
AG: Are you going to attend?  
AX: I actually went today.  
AG: How was it?  
AX: There were freshly baked waffle cones with buns and soft serve on top.  
AG: Understood.  
AX: I could only eat one, but there were many other options too.  
AG: It must have been hard to choose just one.  
AX: Indeed. In Yamanashi, they had various fruit sherbet ice creams.  
AG: Yamanashi is known for its delicious fruits.  
AX: They also had one entirely covered with mandarin oranges and whipped ice cream inside.  
AG: That sounds unique.  
AX: Absolutely. There was also something called macaron ice, and many women were queuing for it.  
AG: Maybe it will be sold in convenience stores eventually.  
AX: Convenience stores make it easy to buy things quickly.  
AG: Yes, that would be convenient.",8
7,"AX: Good evening. Thank you in advance.
AG: Good evening. How can I assist you?
AX: Speaking of which, do you prefer hot drinks?
AG: I prefer warm. How about you?
AX: I am fine with either. Do you drink coffee?
AG: Yes, 1 or 2 cups a day.
AX: I see. I listened to the CEO of Starbucks Japan a while ago.
AG: That sounds interesting.
AX: I called him at the office. He said the coffee at 7-Eleven is delicious.
AG: Noted. 7-Eleven coffee is highly recommended.
AX: He mentioned that cultivating empathy among staff members is left to each individual.
AG: Did you find that useful in practice?
AX: If there's an accident nearby, the clerk might give coffee based on their judgment.
AG: Clerks can offer free drinks on their own initiative.
AX: Yes, the clerk did it voluntarily.
AG: Would you do the same in their place?
AX: I think they talked to them but may not have made coffee. They were empathetic.
AG: I would likely hand it over regardless of the circumstances.
AX: That's suitable for Starbucks. It's good.
AG: I tend to react based on instinct too.
AX: A while ago, I was impressed by something at Starbucks.
AG: What impressed you?
AX: A young girl, likely deaf, communicated by writing but was a clerk.
AG: That is remarkable. There are people like that indeed.
AX: I couldn't hear, so she had an illustrated menu asking to point here.
AG: That is a thoughtful approach.
AX: The clerks only helped when I was in trouble and left me alone otherwise.
AG: That likely made it easier for them to work efficiently.
AX: I see. As a customer, I felt grateful.
AG: A positive atmosphere benefits both customers and staff.",4
8,"AX: Good evening. I'm looking forward to working with you.
AG: Good evening. How can I assist you today?

AX: What type of shaved ice was it?
AG: Clear ice with homemade syrup from a cake shop.
AX: Interesting. There's a shaved ice shop nearby.
AG: Have you tried it?
AX: Not yet. It’s from a dumpling shop.
AG: What's special about it?
AX: It’s topped with three-colored dumplings.
AG: That fits a dumpling shop.
AX: It sounds unusual, but I'm curious to try it.
AG: Does it have sweet red bean paste?
AX: I didn’t see any. There are also fluffy types now.
AG: Inspired by Taiwanese shaved ice.
AX: Have you tried it?
AG: I saw it on TV, but not yet. Mango flavor looks tempting.
AX: The visuals are impressive.
AG: Flavoring the ice itself surprised me.
AX: They flavor the ice. I hadn’t considered that.
AG: It keeps the ice fluffy. I'd like to try it.
AX: I understand now. Thanks.
AG: You're welcome.",7
