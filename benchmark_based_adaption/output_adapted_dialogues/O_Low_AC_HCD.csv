1,"AC: Hi there!  
AA: Hello!  

AC: I want to talk about my student days today!  
AA: Please proceed.  

AC: Let's talk about our student days!  
AA: Are you referring to classes?  

AC: Are you serious?!  
AA: I don't have other memorable experiences.  

AC: What about club activities or first love?  
AA: Please share about your student days.  

AC: Club activities were a highlight.  
AA: Noted.  

AC: And a bit of a romance with my senior.  
AA: Understood.  

AC: On my first date, I tripped on the stairs at the station.  
AA: Confirmed.  

AC: I have never been so embarrassed before or since!  
AA: That must have been awkward.  

AC: Yes, it was quite awkward and naturally faded away.  
AA: Acknowledged.  

AC: High school students don't have much adult composure.  
AA: Adult composure is valuable.  

AC: Is that so? How is your current romance?  
AA: I haven't been in love before.  

AC: Next time we meet, I'm going to ask you all about it.  
AA: We can continue next time.  

AC: Please look forward to it! Until next time!  
AA: Until next time!",5
2,"AC: Hello!  
AA: Hello!  
AC: Have you been to the 100 yen shop recently?  
AA: Yes, I bought cleaning supplies.  
AC: That's timely! What did you need to clean?  
AA: A water pipe. It's a cleaner you just put in.  
AC: I didn’t realize you could buy that for 100 yen!  
AA: Yes, but the quality might not be great.  
AC: True, you get what you pay for.  
AA: Exactly, not everything can be done with just 100 yen.  
AC: I learned that recently.  
AA: What happened?  
AC: I bought a calculator, but it broke within a month.  
AA: 100 yen, 30 days of use.  
AC: That’s frustrating.  
AA: It’s a tough lesson.  
AC: Spending more than 1,000 yen can make items last for years.  
AA: That’s an important insight.  
AC: Yes! Staying positive is important!  
AA: It’s enjoyable to explore the 100 yen shop.  
AC: I agree, there are many interesting items.  
AA: Yes, you can find many unexpected things.  
AC: And useful kitchen utensils too!  
AA: Yes, I buy a lot when I move.  
AC: What kind of things?  
AA: I bought tongs that can also cut and serve as a bowl.  
AC: That sounds useful! Is it big?  
AA: No, it’s a normal size but good for draining pasta.  
AC: I’ll look for it at Daiso next time!  
AA: Please do! Thank you!",4
3,"AC: Hello! Nice to meet you.  
AA: Hello.  
AC: Do you have insurance?  
AA: My mother set it up for me.  
AC: Your mom is kind and reliable.  
AA: But I’m often easy to deceive.  
AC: Is that so?  
AA: Yes. How about you?  
AC: I finally got one.  
AA: What kind of insurance?  
AC: Hospitalization insurance. I was considering a savings-based one.  
AA: Hospitalization insurance is necessary now.  
AC: Does it cover coronavirus?  
AA: Not sure, but if it’s excluded, that’s bad.  
AC: Have you ever been hospitalized?  
AA: No, I’m healthy.  
AC: That’s good! I’ve only been hospitalized once.  
AA: Why were you hospitalized?  
AC: Appendicitis. I was discharged quickly, but COVID-19 would take longer.  
AA: That must have been painful.  
AC: It gets better soon. A COVID-19 stay can last weeks.  
AA: That’s true. Finding a bed is tough.  
AC: I heard it’s really bad now.  
AA: It’s fully booked and dangerous.  
AC: That’s scary! I have to be careful.  
AA: Even if careful, it’s challenging.  
AC: Building physical strength and getting enough nutrition is important.  
AA: Let’s do our best. Thank you.  
AC: Thank you!",2
4,"AC: Hello. Thanks for your hard work!  
AA: Hello! Thank you for your hard work as well.  
AC: Did you do anything today?  
AA: I went shopping today.  
AC: Oh! What did you buy?  
AA: I thought about buying vegetables, but I didn't purchase any.  
AC: Were they expensive?  
AA: The prices were higher than I expected, so maybe next time.  
AC: Prices have been increasing for everything recently, haven't they?  
AA: Yes, everything is getting more expensive and it's troublesome.  
AC: Even summer vegetables should be cheaper now.  
AA: It seems that way, but the heat might be the cause after all.  
AC: That's very likely! Do you usually cook for yourself?  
AA: I do, but only a little.  
AC: Are you good at cooking?  
AA: Not really, I often struggle with getting the taste right.  
AC: When I cook, I usually season food to my own taste.  
AA: I understand. When my family tries my food, they sometimes give me a 'What?' look.  
AC: That sounds pretty nice! Do you use cookbooks or the internet for guidance?  
AA: I do, but if I get lazy and don't follow them properly, it shows immediately.  
AC: How about tasting your food while cooking?  
AA: I do, but it often tastes strange from the start.  
AC: Do you make adjustments?  
AA: When I try to adjust, it sometimes gets worse.  
AC: I understand that. The way we perceive taste can change with temperature.  
AA: Are you good at cooking?  
AC: No, I rely heavily on mentsuyu.  
AA: Mentsuyu is truly a lifesaver!  
AC: Exactly, mentsuyu is essential in Japanese cooking!  
AA: I completely agree! Thank you very much!",3
5,"AC: Hello!  
AA: How can I assist you today?  
AC: Have you been to an amusement park lately?  
AA: No, I haven't. Did you?  
AC: No, but I want to visit places like Disneyland.  
AA: During COVID-19, Disney wasn't very crowded.  
AC: Interesting! It might be a good time to visit.  
AA: It used to require reservations, but not anymore.  
AC: So, it was reservation-only for a while.  
AA: Yes, it was quite empty then.  
AC: I can't imagine an empty Disneyland!  
AA: Typically, there are long waits for rides.  
AC: Exactly! Without the wait, it would be great.  
AA: Do you prefer Disneyland or DisneySea?  
AC: I've never been to DisneySea.  
AA: Understood.  
AC: I used to live close by and got tired of the nightly fireworks.  
AA: Was it near Maihama?  
AC: Yes, being close made me hesitate to go. Seeing it from afar makes me want to visit.  
AA: Noted. Locals often visit less frequently.  
AC: Yes, exactly. That's why I've never been to Tokyo Tower.  
AA: Where do you live now?  
AC: I am at the westernmost tip of Kyushu.  
AA: Is it Kagoshima?  
AC: In that direction, but not near Sakurajima.  
AA: Understood. I am going to Kagoshima in October.  
AC: Great, have fun! The food there is delicious.  
AA: Noted. Have a nice day!",11
6,"AC: Hello, nice to meet you.  
AA: Hello, nice to meet you.  
AC: By the way, do you participate in hometown tax donations?  
AA: Considering it. Have you done it before?  
AC: Yes, I have.  
AA: What did you receive?  
AC: Aladdin's toaster.  
AA: Really? Can I get something like that?  
AC: Yes, I got it for 2000 yen.  
AA: Which city was it?  
AC: Hyogo. They make graphite heaters there.  
AA: Rakuten's hometown tax donation?  
AC: Yes, exactly that.  
AA: Rakuten does a lot.  
AC: Yes, I found it by chance while searching.  
AA: Lucky. Contributed and got Aladdin.  
AC: Yes, it was a great deal. Plus, I earned Rakuten points.  
AA: Rakuten has many campaigns. My money drains.  
AC: I understand. Shopping sprees are crazy.  
AA: I find more to buy, like pulling a string of potatoes.  
AC: Exactly! They keep coming. What is that phenomenon?  
AA: Rakuten's marketing is effective.  
AC: I think so too. One-day coupon is tempting.  
AA: Expiration dates are unfair!  
AC: Yes, be careful not to buy too much.  
AA: Need more money. Thank you very much!",4
7,"AC: Hello!  
AA: Good evening!  
AC: Is it already that time?  
AA: Yes, it seems like it.  
AC: The days have indeed become shorter recently.  
AA: Right, when is the best time to switch greetings?  
AC: Maybe when the evening chime rings?  
AA: So, 5 o'clock?  
AC: Right. Will the chime ring?  
AA: It doesn't ring on my end.  
AC: Oh, really? Is it because there are fields and such?  
AA: My friend's place gets affected. I wonder why.  
AC: When I heard it as a child, I hurried home.  
AA: There was a curfew, huh?  
AC: Yes, that's right. When playing outside, you lose track of time.  
AA: Indeed. How did we check the time back then?  
AC: I used to ask strangers for the time if I didn't have a watch.  
AA: That did happen. They would let us know. We can't do that now.  
AC: That's right! People are cautious about suspicious individuals!  
AA: Even looking without intentions, I'm afraid of being treated like a suspicious person.  
AC: I understand. I try not to stare at children.  
AA: It has become inconvenient, hasn't it?  
AC: Yes, it used to be normal to get scolded by strangers back in the day!  
AA: Yes, we were just talking normally.  
AC: So nostalgic.  
AA: The world has become convenient but equally inconvenient.  
AC: Yes. I miss when unknown old ladies would give us candy or tangerines.  
AA: Yes, that happened! We used to visit each other's houses to hang out.  
AC: Showa era, completely Showa era!  
AA: Nostalgic, I want to go back!  
AC: Okay! See you!",1
8,"AC: Good evening.  
AA: Good evening.  
AC: Have you decided on the menu for dinner tonight?  
AA: Not yet. Any suggestions?  
AC: Meat or fish?  
AA: Meat.  
AC: Chicken is a good option.  
AA: Chicken is healthy and affordable.  
AC: Yes, affordability is important.  
AA: Living alone taught me that.  
AC: I also buy chicken breast because it's economical.  
AA: Breast meat, definitely. Are you a fish person or a meat person?  
AC: I like grilled fish such as Pacific saury.  
AA: Grilled saury in autumn is nice.  
AC: Delicious with rice and beer.  
AA: Perfect autumn table.  
AC: Everything is delicious in autumn. Lots of fruits too.  
AA: Autumn has beautiful foliage, Harvest Moon, and delicious food.  
AC: New rice is also available.  
AA: New harvest rice is great.  
AC: It is very tasty.  
AA: Yes. I recently had some expensive rice, and it was amazing.  
AC: Really? Branded rice?  
AA: Yes, from a rice shop. I could tell in one bite.  
AC: One bite makes a difference. What brand?  
AA: Milky Queen.  
AC: That sounds delicious. From Hokkaido?  
AA: Not sure. The luxurious bag sold me.  
AC: I'll try buying that this fall.  
AA: Definitely.",5
