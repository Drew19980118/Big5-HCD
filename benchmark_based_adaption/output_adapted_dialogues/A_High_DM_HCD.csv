BP: It's about the Kamakura shogunate. Mr. Oguri plays Yoshitoki, the younger brother of Masako Hojo.
DM: Taiga dramas are very informative.
BP: Yes, but I watch explanation videos on YouTube to understand better.
DM: I also can't keep up when there are too many characters.
BP: This drama covers the Kamakura Shogunate and the 13 retainers, so there are many characters.
DM: YouTube explanations are useful. I might need notes to keep up.
BP: Indeed. Among the movies you've seen recently in the theater, which one was the best?

BP: I watched Kingdom's first part and am curious about the sequel. Was it grand?
