1,"GA: Please!
CB: Please!
GA: Do you usually play games?
CB: I don't play games, but my kids are always on Minecraft.
GA: Just Minecraft? We can't play together then.
CB: Older child uses the PC, younger one uses the iPad for cooperative play. I just watch.
GA: Wow. Are your kids in elementary school?
CB: Older one is in sixth grade, younger one is in first grade.
GA: Impressive they can use an iPad so well. Do most kids have one now?
CB: It wasn't meant for the child, but now my iPad is used by them.
GA: I see. So, Minecraft can be played on an iPad.
CB: Yes. Older child got into it and loves it. Younger one likes someone from Minecraft's Colorful Peach.
GA: Because of the older sibling? I don't know that person; first time hearing about them.
CB: It's popular, and there's merchandise too, which I had to buy.
GA: It's that popular, huh?
CB: My first grader loves it so much she sleeps with the keychain.
GA: I looked it up; different from what I expected. I thought it was someone who shows their face.
CB: 13 members, only 2 show their faces.
GA: So, some do show their faces. Common to get hooked from first grade?
CB: Research suggests most kids are around fourth or fifth grade, so first grade is early.
GA: Even fourth grade seems early. I didn't use the internet much myself.
CB: Main age range is from fourth grade to university students. Surprising to see children so into 2D.
GA: You can see unexpected sides of your children.
CB: Older one, being a boy, matures quickly. Younger one is precocious.
GA: There's a group called Sutapora. A friend is a member. Check them out! You might get hooked.
CB: I'll mention it to the child.
GA: I sing in the 2D world and do game commentary.
CB: Watching now. Popular, high subscribers.
GA: I haven't supported them much, but they are doing well.
CB: He says he might like Kotaro. Thanks!",2
2,"GA: Hello. Nice to meet you.
EO: Hello. Nice to meet you.
GA: Did you have breakfast today?
EO: Yes, I am currently eating.
GA: I am also eating right now.
EO: What are you having?
GA: I am eating rice with a raw egg.
EO: Nutritious.
GA: I added olive oil, wasabi, and used noodle soup base instead of soy sauce. I recommend it.
EO: Interesting combination.
GA: My sense of taste is dull, so I use both.
EO: I might try it.
GA: Olive oil alone is good too. What are you eating?
EO: Toast, boiled egg, grapes, and pumpkin salad.
GA: Sounds good.
EO: Yes.
GA: Is the salad from last night’s dinner?
EO: Yes.
GA: Seems like a lot of work.
EO: I do not prepare such dishes in the morning.
GA: I rarely cook, so it seems challenging to me.
EO: Do you cook at all?
GA: My mother cooks since I live with my parents.
EO: Understood.
GA: I appreciate her efforts.
EO: Care for your mother.
GA: Yes, I should cook occasionally.
EO: Cooking skills are beneficial.
GA: I will practice.
EO: Good luck.",7
3,"GA: Good morning.
EO: Good morning.
GA: What are your hobbies?
EO: I enjoy reading.
GA: That sounds interesting. What kind of books do you read?
EO: I read various genres, mainly novels and parenting books.
GA: I see... I don't read much myself. Should I start?
EO: Everyone has different preferences, and that's okay.
GA: I prefer watching anime over reading. Recently, I finished BLEACH.
EO: BLEACH is a classic series.
GA: Yes, it's quite old now.
EO: I used to collect the paperback editions.
GA: It really resonates with certain generations.
EO: Definitely. The rescue of Rukia is a memorable part.
GA: I haven't finished it, but I enjoyed the Arrancar arc.
EO: That part has great characters.
GA: I found myself quoting lines from BLEACH.
EO: Can you give an example?
GA: More like imitating their style of speaking.
EO: Something like ""Bankai""?
GA: Exactly, especially when gaming.
EO: My children do that too.
GA: I guess I'm still quite childish.
EO: Staying young at heart is a positive trait.
GA: My friends tell me the same thing. I'm thankful.
EO: It's good to have supportive friends.
GA: Yes, I'm lucky to have them.
EO: Let's keep that youthful spirit alive!",1
4,"GA: Thank you in advance!
EO: Hello! I listened to your song.
GA: Thank you, I appreciate it.
EO: It felt good to hear it. Is this Kansai dialect?
GA: Yes, that's correct. I'm from Kansai, and I had Yashiki Takajin in mind while creating it.
EO: Got it. I am also from Kansai, which makes me feel more connected to you.
GA: That's nice to know. I'm glad you enjoyed it.
EO: It's impressive that you made this yourself. Are you planning to become a composer?
GA: It would be nice to get used to it.
EO: I hope you do. Do you work every day?
GA: It varies a lot. Most days, I don't feel motivated and haven't been able to accomplish much lately.
EO: Have you told your parents about your composition?
GA: My parents are unaware of my music.
EO: Is that a secret?
GA: I don't talk about myself much with my parents.
EO: As a parent, that's a little concerning.
GA: When I was younger, I talked a lot. But since junior high, I stopped sharing my concerns.
EO: That's unfortunate. As a parent, I would want to know everything. Is it the same with your father?
GA: My mother can handle it to some extent, but I can't tell my father until I'm really pushed.
EO: Your father seems strict.
GA: He's mellowed out a lot with age.
EO: Yes, parents often do mellow out.
GA: I understand it's normal for parents to be strict, but sometimes I feel I'm just being cowardly.
EO: Is he also intimidating? My father is quite strict too.
GA: He can be intimidating.
EO: At our house, if we didn't sit properly at meals, we would get hit from behind.
GA: That's scary! My dad once threw a cabbage at me a long time ago.
EO: Why a cabbage?
GA: It was probably just nearby.
EO: That's quite funny.",1
5,"GA: Please!
EO: Nice to meet you!
GA: Tell me about your family memories.
EO: It's complex.
GA: Apologies for asking.
EO: Are you asking about your current household or birth family?
GA: Current household. It's hard to explain briefly, sorry.
EO: Understood.
GA: Do your children participate in any extracurricular activities?
EO: Apologies for the delay. They attend art class, and I'm heading to mini-basketball practice now.
GA: That sounds versatile. Mini-basketball is basketball, correct?
EO: Yes.
GA: Do you have good motor skills?
EO: No.
GA: Surprising. Are they facing challenges?
EO: No, I chose it and enjoy it.
GA: If they enjoy it, they'll likely become very athletic in the future. Is this the same child attending the painting class?
EO: The eldest and second son attend art class. Mini-basketball is only for the eldest son in elementary school.
GA: I see. Impressive, as I couldn't stick with lessons when younger.
EO: Did you learn anything?
GA: I tried abacus, cram school, and English conversation, but only stuck with the latter.
EO: Are you good at English?
GA: My pronunciation is decent, but not the rest.
EO: Understood.
GA: I attended English conversation classes for a childhood friend. Studying isn't my thing either.
EO: Understood.
GA: I wish I could speak English fluently.
EO: Did that happen?",5
6,"GA: Please!
EO: Thank you.
GA: What music do you listen to?
EO: Anime theme songs.
GA: Recent ones?
EO: Yes, like Mixed Nuts and Habit.
GA: Not familiar with recent ones.
EO: My child watches Spy x Family. I'm rewatching Naruto.
GA: Rewatching Naruto takes time.
EO: Orochimaru and the Third Hokage are fighting.
GA: That’s early in the series.
EO: I've watched a little.
GA: Could take 2-3 years without fillers.
EO: That long?
GA: Aired for 15 years.
EO: Surprising.
GA: Enjoy it.
EO: I will. When did you become a shut-in?
GA: During COVID-19.
EO: Recent.
GA: I started slacking in junior high, dropped out of high school, and couldn’t keep a part-time job.
EO: Tough situation.
GA: Yes.
EO: I was often late too.
GA: If late, I thought it was better not to go.
EO: I was late but went. I'd arrive at lunch break.
GA: Being late meant writing reflection papers.
EO: Yes, we wrote those.
GA: Things might have been different without that system.
EO: Indeed.",15
7,"GA: Please!
EO: Hello! How can I assist you today?
GA: What kind of part-time jobs have you done so far?
EO: I've worked in various roles: Izakaya, convenience store, family restaurant, home tutor, cram school teacher, cabaret club, and apparel.
GA: That sounds like a lot of customer service jobs. It must be challenging if you're shy.
EO: Yes, but work often requires stepping out of comfort zones.
GA: I kind of get that. Talking to strangers can sometimes be easier.
EO: Indeed, customer interactions can be distinct.
GA: When I worked at a call center, my communication skills improved. It was quite beneficial.
EO: Working at a call center sounds interesting.
GA: Surprisingly, it was easier than expected once I got used to the manual.
EO: Really? It seemed complex.
GA: It varies by place. The call center I worked at focused on staff support, not customer complaints.
EO: There are different types of call centers.
GA: I felt that way too.
EO: What other part-time jobs have you done?
GA: Warehouse work, stocking at a supermarket, bread factory, and game bug testing (I quit both in one day).
EO: Those are more behind-the-scenes roles.
GA: Mostly back-office work. I was initially resistant to the call center job.
EO: It's a job involving a lot of communication.
GA: I had no customer service experience, so I was nervous but got used to it in less than a month.
EO: Did you stick with it for long?
GA: Yes, it was my longest-lasting job. I got along well with colleagues and was often praised.
EO: Why did you quit?
GA: I often quit jobs because I ""lost to myself.""
EO: Can you elaborate?
GA: I struggled with getting up in the morning, which often led to me not going to work.
EO: Perhaps you were unknowingly accumulating stress?
GA: I don’t feel stressed, but I sometimes stop even when things are going well.
EO: It is quite curious.",1
8,"GA: Please!
EO: Thank you in advance! How can I assist you?
GA: ""Does the fact that you were doing tutoring and working at a cram school mean that you were smart?""
EO: I am proficient in Japanese. How can I help with that?
GA: Is it possible to have a part-time teaching job specializing in Japanese language?
EO: It is feasible to teach only Japanese.
GA: Wow! I had the impression that you had to be good at all subjects.
EO: At cram schools, subjects like Japanese and math are scheduled separately.
GA: There were also teachers who only handled math at my cram school.
EO: Correct. Tutors for elementary students might teach other subjects as well.
GA: If you could exercise with that too, wouldn't it be perfect?
EO: Unfortunately, exercising isn't part of the job requirements.
GA: Everyone has some shortcomings... I also wanted to try being a teacher.
EO: Have you considered being an English teacher?
GA: No way... I felt embarrassed saying I could speak English.
EO: What was your deviation score?
GA: The high school I entered was ranked around 47 at that time.
EO: Understood, 47. 
GA: ""It's a relatively average high school. No delinquent people, though.""
EO: My high school was around 55, and my score in Japanese was about 65.
GA: Around 60 seems enjoyable. To be 65, you must be outstanding!
EO: I couldn't reach 70, that's my limit.
GA: People around 70 may lack balance, so it's best to be neither too smart nor too foolish!
EO: That's true! My older brother is a researcher and he's very intelligent but has his quirks.
GA: Surprising news again...
EO: He researches cancer at ** but has serious personality issues.
GA: Many smart people find it hard to communicate. It might not be an issue among themselves though.
EO: Compatibility could be a factor.
GA: I've heard that if the IQ gap is too wide, communication becomes difficult.
EO: Understood.",1
