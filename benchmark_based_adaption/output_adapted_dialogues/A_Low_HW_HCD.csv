EU: Nice to meet you, please let me know how I can assist you.  
HW: It's a perfect day for sports, isn't it? Do you have any sports you're good at?  
EU: I'm not very skilled at sports, but I enjoy swimming. How about you?  
HW: Swimming, huh! Today is perfect for swimming! I play tennis as a hobby.  
EU: Tennis is interesting! It's known as the gentleman's game.  
HW: Yes, that's right. Skilled people have a gentlemanly form.  
EU: It seems quite hot in the summer; you might need to be careful. Tennis involves hard movements.  
HW: It's the kind of temperature today that makes you want to swim in the sea rather than play tennis. Have you gone swimming this year?  
EU: The only thing I've done is go to the local public pool with my child. We had originally planned to go to the river today.  
HW: The public pool looks fun! I'm envious.  
EU: Due to the coronavirus situation, it wasn't too crowded, which was good.  
HW: It's great that it wasn't crowded! I like the cool feeling of a private pool.  
EU: A private pool sounds nice!  
HW: When I was a child, there was a time when I arrived at the public pool first thing in the morning, and it was almost like having it all to myself. It left an impression on me because it felt different from usual.  
EU: Wow! Does ""first thing in the morning"" mean around 8 o'clock?  
HW: I think it was probably about that time. After that, I swam with a friend and ate ice cream. Don't you think there are a lot of ice cream vending machines at the public pool?  
EU: Yes, there's an ice cream vending machine. Cup noodles and such are also really delicious at that time.  
HW: You get hungry after swimming, don't you?  
EU: Everything I eat is really delicious. I feel like swimming now. Apologies for talking only about myself.  
HW: I like listening to people, so it's okay.  
EU: You are very kind. I'd love to hear more about tennis next time.  
HW: If it's about unusual tennis plays, I can always talk about them.  
EU: Rare play! That sounds interesting.  
HW: I'm having a good time with my tennis club friends. Could it make for an essay comic? Hahaha.  
EU: You're in a club! How serious! Are you an expert?  
HW: This is a beginner's tennis club that often makes funny mistakes. Let's talk again sometime soon!  
EU: I'd like that. Please let me talk with you again!

HW: What are you having for dinner tonight?

HW: Try banana bread with bananas and pancake mix.
IM: Looks easy to make.
HW: I will make it again when butter is cheaper.
IM: Is butter expensive now?
HW: Yes, ingredient prices are high due to living costs.
IM: I will buy finished products until it gets cheaper.
HW: I will too. Let’s talk again!
IM: Okay.",5
5,"HW: Thank you.  
IM: You're welcome.  
HW: I'm watching anime, any recommendations?  
IM: Demon Slayer.  
HW: Did you watch the anime or read the manga?

HW: Binge-watching is fun. Do you eat anything while watching anime?  
IM: Yes, potato chips.  
HW: What flavor do you like?  
IM: Lightly salted or limited edition.  
HW: I had thick-cut ridged potato chips.  
IM: I'll try them. They make your hands dirty.  
HW: When eating, you can't do other tasks.  
IM: Yes, touched my smartphone and it was a problem.  
HW: That must have been tough.  
IM: Now, I use wet tissues.  
HW: That's a good habit. Thanks.  
IM: Thank you.",8
6,"HW: Thank you in advance.
IM: You're welcome.
HW: It's hot every day, isn't it?
IM: Yes, it is. Do you have any tips to stay cool?
HW: I'm using a cool towel that gets chilly with water.
IM: What is a cool ring?
HW: It's a ring that freezes below 28°C and doesn't wet your clothes.
IM: Useful.
HW: Yes, it keeps the neck dry unlike towels.
IM: Wet clothes and bulky luggage are issues.
HW: Summer luggage can be heavy.
IM: Traveling with lots of luggage is troublesome.
HW: Compact luggage helps. I like carrying my favorite drink.
IM: Many drinks available. Any recommendations?
HW: Jasmine tea or flavored tea powder, but it may not be for everyone.
IM: I like jasmine tea. Flavored tea powder sounds interesting.
HW: There's an apple and vanilla-flavored tea powder at the supermarket.
IM: Convenient. I now prefer water.
HW: Water is healthy. Do you prefer hard or soft water?
IM: I find hard water unpleasant.
HW: Hard water isn't good for tea and feels different to drink.
IM: My mother liked hard water, so we had both at home.
HW: Understood.
IM: Hard water is suitable for cooking.
HW: I didn't know that. Water is more complex than I thought.
IM: The type of water used does vary.
HW: I'll look into it more.
IM: I will research it too.
HW: Thank you for the conversation.
IM: You're welcome.",10

HW: Do you like animals?  
IM: Yes, I like them so much that I even have pets at home!  
HW: What kind of animal do you have?  
IM: I have a cat at home! It’s a stray cat, so it doesn’t have a pedigree, but it’s just so cute and soothing.  
HW: Do you have a cat? What color is your cat?  
IM: It's a milk tea color! Are pets not allowed?  
HW: I have a cat allergy, so I can't keep one.  
IM: I see, that must be tough.  
HW: I watch cats on TV shows. Living with a cat seems fun.  
IM: It's fun, but taking care of living creatures can be challenging.  
HW: What kind of things are difficult, for example?  
IM: There are various difficulties, but the biggest one is not being able to travel, I suppose.  
HW: I see. Is traveling still difficult even with water dispensers and automatic feeders?  
IM: What, there is something that convenient! I didn't know.  
HW: I saw it on Amazon. The world is convenient.  
IM: If I have that, I might be able to go on a trip. I didn't know because I haven't used Amazon much.  
HW: I haven't used it either. Is your cat already big?  
IM: He is older in age and also quite a large, chubby cat.  
HW: Big cats are wonderful too. They have a different cuteness compared to kittens.  
IM: That's right, kittens are cute, but the feeling of holding a big cat is completely different.  
HW: Life with a cat seems fun.  
IM: These days, you can even watch it on YouTube, so even people who can't keep pets can enjoy it. Do you watch YouTube or anything like that?  
HW: Sometimes, I watch cat videos. There are also various cat toys.  
IM: There are lots of cat toys, but they get bored with them quickly, don't they?  
HW: That's a problem.  
IM: Therefore, we have a large amount of unused toys in our house. This is also one of the difficult things.  
HW: Thank you for the enjoyable conversation! Let's talk again!  
IM: Please do it again.",1
