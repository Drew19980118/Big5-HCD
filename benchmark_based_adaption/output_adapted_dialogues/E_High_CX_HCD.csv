CX: Just take preventive measures.
BU: Let’s move on from COVID talk.
CX: Got it. Any positive news?

CX: Do you follow baseball? I support the Giants.
BU: I support the Dragons.
CX: Ohno was good yesterday.
BU: Yes.
CX: Our pitching staff struggles.
BU: Hirauchi has had a tough time. Walker and Nakayama are notable players for the Giants.

BU: Okamoto was moved from the fourth position. Nakata is doing well now.
CX: Okamoto is struggling. Nakata hit a home run yesterday.
BU: He has improved since playing against Chunichi.
CX: It’s impressive to hit off Rydel.
BU: His first home run this year.
CX: The catcher's lead is a concern.
BU: Commentators criticize Kinotaku's leadership.
CX: You need a strong catcher?

CX: Like Yakult’s Nakamura.
BU: Nakamura’s performance dipped after his jersey number changed.",16
2,"CX: Are there any long holidays like the Obon holiday?

BU: Did you work for a well-known TV company?
CX: It was a production company, not very famous.
BU: Who's the most famous person you've met?
CX: Probably Banana Man.
BU: That's impressive. I like comedians.
CX: Banana Man is kind and funny.
BU: They appear on many TV shows.

CX: Mr. Shitara makes jokes even during breaks.
BU: Sounds like a fun work environment.
CX: It was lively and bustling.
BU: A good atmosphere makes for a good program.

3,"CX: Hello. Do you have any plans for today or tomorrow?  
BU: Hello. No specific plans. How about you?  
CX: I don't have anything either. I feel like just relaxing.  
BU: Understood. Have you eaten rice?  
CX: I'm planning to have lunch soon.  
BU: Have you decided what to eat?  
CX: Pork shabu-shabu, I think.  
BU: Noted.  
CX: It's just boiled pork and bean sprouts.  
BU: Do you make the broth yourself?  
CX: No, I just use hot water.  
BU: Acknowledged.  
CX: I just picture boiling water with meat and vegetables.  
BU: Do you use ponzu sauce?  
CX: I use a grated daikon radish sauce.  
BU: Is it mixed with ponzu?  
CX: Maybe, but it doesn't taste like it much.  
BU: It's refreshing. Do you like grated daikon?  
CX: I like it, but I don't usually grate it myself.  
BU: It's easier to buy it pre-grated.  
CX: True. Grilled fish with grated daikon and soy sauce is great occasionally.  
BU: Grated daikon and soy sauce pair well with fatty fish like Atka mackerel.  
CX: That sounds good! I think it tastes better with fatty fish.  
BU: It's delicious. I don't often eat grilled fish at home.  
CX: I only have it at nearby set meal restaurants occasionally.  
BU: The fish there is delicious.  
CX: What are you planning to have for lunch?  
BU: I usually skip lunch.

4,"CX: Hello. Is it hot over there?
CO: Yes, it is hot.
CX: Are you avoiding heatstroke?
CO: I'm being careful.
CX: Stay cool.
CO: Thanks. My friend had heatstroke recently.
CX: Is your friend okay now?
CO: Yes, but it was serious.
CX: Emergency transport can be difficult due to COVID.
CO: Yes, they hadn't been drinking enough water.
CX: Hydration is key.
CO: Yes, the doctor emphasized that.
CX: A typhoon is coming. Are you prepared?
CO: Yes. How about you?
CX: We're okay for now.
CO: Are you prepared for disasters?
CX: Not fully, but we have some supplies.
CO: Important to be prepared.
CX: True.
CO: It minimizes damage.
CX: My apartment is on the second floor, so we should be safe.
CO: That's good. Last year, signs flew around during a typhoon.
CX: That sounds bad.
CO: Yes, we're more cautious now.
CX: With climate news about typhoons and heavy rains, it's worrying.
CO: The typhoon is in the Kanto region now.
CX: It seems so. Events are being canceled.
CO: I'm worried about a friend in Kanto.
CX: Hope they stay safe.
CO: Yes, let's hope so.",7
5,"CX: Thank you in advance. Do you have something like an Obon holiday?
CO: Yes, I have a week off.
CX: That sounds nice! Do you have any plans?
CO: Nothing in particular.
CX: Is it difficult to make plans because of COVID-19?
CO: Yes, exactly. If it weren't for COVID-19, I would have gone somewhere.

CO: Do you have any plans?

CO: Is it work?
CX: No, I'm taking a break from work now. So, I've been off all the time.
CO: Understood.

CO: How long have you been resting?
CX: About two and a half years.
CO: That's quite a long time. What was your previous job?

CO: Certainly. Are you still not looking for a job yet?
CX: Yes. I am currently considering what to do next.
CO: Understood. It seems difficult to move around now with the coronavirus situation.
CX: That's really it. There are fewer job openings as well.

CX: I wonder what will happen next.
CO: I understand.",2
6,"CX: Hello! Nice to meet you!  
AT: Nice to meet you too. How can I assist you today?  
CX: Is it hot there today?  
AT: It's humid due to an approaching typhoon.  
CX: It's quite hot and stuffy here too.  
AT: That's expected in summer.  
CX: It feels like it has been getting hotter these past few years.  
AT: Some regions have reached over 40 degrees this year.  
CX: That's right. I went to Tokyo during that period, and it was extremely hot.  
AT: That must have been tough. It's cool indoors though.  
CX: To prevent heatstroke, we stayed indoors most of the time.  
AT: A wise decision. Many regions face intense heat and water damage.  
CX: Certainly. In my area, it's been raining heavily this past week.  
AT: Was there any damage to your house?  
CX: Fortunately, there was no damage.  
AT: My parent's hometown, Gojome Town in Akita Prefecture, is in the news today.  
CX: I see. Are they safe at the moment?  
AT: Yes, they are okay. The weather has been unstable.  
CX: That's true. The coronavirus situation is also concerning.  
AT: It's spreading again, causing medical strain.  
CX: Emergency transport can't keep up due to COVID-19 and heatstroke. It's scary.  
AT: It's tough for those who can't get treatment for other illnesses.  
CX: It's painful that people can't receive medical care and pass away due to non-COVID reasons.  
AT: COVID-19 has many variants. It feels never-ending.  
CX: Last year, I thought it was over after getting the vaccine, but it seems like it will continue for a while.  
AT: Yes, the fourth dose is approaching.  
CX: This is my fourth shot this month, but I expect a fifth and sixth time too.  
AT: This is already the fourth time? Any side effects previously?  
CX: The side effects of the third Moderna shot were tough, so I really don't want to get another one.  
AT: Understood. Please take care of your health.",4
7,"CX: Good evening. Is it almost time for dinner?  
AT: Yes, it's time to start getting ready.  
CX: What are you planning to eat?  
AT: I haven't decided yet. What will you eat?  
CX: I'll have miso soup and canned fish tonight.  
AT: Is that all?  
CX: Yes, I'm eating less at dinner lately because my stomach hasn't been feeling well.  
AT: I see. Fish is nutritious, and canned fish is easy and convenient.  
CX: I'm just trying to get the necessary nutrition.  
AT: Do you eat vegetables?  
CX: Yes, I'll add vegetables to the miso soup.  
AT: That's a good balance. Do you eat properly in the morning and afternoon?  
CX: Yes, I have a solid breakfast and lunch, and keep dinner light.  
AT: In that case, there's no problem. You just need to rest in the evening.  
CX: However, I've been gaining weight recently, which troubles me.  
AT: That could be due to lack of exercise.  
CX: Yes, and I'm wondering if my autonomic nerves are affected.  
AT: That makes sense. It's important to address that as well.  
CX: I often wake up in the middle of the night because it's hard to sleep, which might not be good.  
AT: I experience that too, waking up about once every three hours.  
CX: I wish it were a little cooler or that there was less of a temperature difference.  
AT: Don't you have the air conditioner on at home?  
CX: I live in Hokkaido and don't have an air conditioner at home.  
AT: Summers in Hokkaido can still be hot, and the rain and earthquakes have been intense.  
CX: In the past, I was fine without an air conditioner, but recently it's been especially hot.  
AT: Let's consider installing an air conditioner!  
CX: I'll seriously think about it next year!  
AT: It's a good idea to research measures this year for heatstroke prevention and better sleep.  
CX: Yes, I'd like to have the installation done around early spring.  
AT: Since reservations get crowded in summer, that's a good plan!",1
8,"CX: Thank you in advance. Do you have any plans for tomorrow?  
AT: No plans for tomorrow. How about you?  
CX: No plans either. I'll probably take it easy like today.  
AT: Same here. I usually relax on Sundays before Monday work.  
CX: What kind of work do you do?  
AT: System engineer. Mostly desk work.  
CX: That must be tough on your shoulders and eyes.  
AT: Yes, shoulders and lower back get stiff.  
CX: I used to do desk work too. It's hard on the body.  
AT: It becomes uncomfortable when stiff.  
CX: They say not to massage yourself too much, but I still do it.  
AT: I use massage machines and visit a chiropractor.  
CX: That sounds necessary. I used a microwaveable adzuki bean warmer for my shoulders.  
AT: What is that?  
CX: You heat it in the microwave and place it on your eyes or shoulders.  
AT: It improves blood circulation.  
CX: Yes, and it’s reusable.  
AT: Do you get stiff when you read books?  
CX: Yes, I do. I usually stretch to loosen up.  
AT: Stretching is necessary but hard at the office.  
CX: You could try turning your neck or pulling your arms back.  
AT: I'll move around frequently when working from home.  
CX: Have you been able to work from home often?  
AT: It's about half going to the office and half working remotely.  
CX: One good thing from COVID-19 is the ability to work from home.  
AT: Yes, it's nice to cut down on commute time.  
CX: Crowded trains are tough.  
AT: I'll optimize remote work with the ongoing COVID situation.  
CX: I hope telecommuting becomes more widespread.  
AT: Noted, thank you.",6
