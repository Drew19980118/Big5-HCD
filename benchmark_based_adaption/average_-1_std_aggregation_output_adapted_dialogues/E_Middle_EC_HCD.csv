1,"EC: Hello  
DG: Hello!  
EC: I’ve been finding daily cooking quite tedious lately. Are there any easy and frequently made dishes you can suggest?  
DG: ""Lately, I’ve been eating a lot of somen noodles. They can be prepared in various ways.""  
EC: How can you prepare somen in different ways?  
DG: You can add minced meat miso or tomatoes.  
EC: Do you add the meat miso and tomatoes directly onto the somen noodles?  
DG: Yes, exactly. Sometimes I use store-bought options.  
EC: That sounds great! Changing the flavors will make somen noodles enjoyable.  
DG: I also tried a chijimi (Korean pancake) recipe from COOKPAD.  
EC: Do you mix it with flour and bake it?  
DG: I finely chopped boiled somen, added potato starch, and it turned out chewy.  
EC: Chewy sounds nice! I’ll give it a shot next time.  
DG: Adding leftover green onions made it better.  
EC: Green onions are a great addition! I’ve got my menu planned for tomorrow’s dinner. Thanks!  
DG: You’re welcome. Cookpad makes it convenient to try out anything!  
EC: Does Cookpad ever have any misses?  
DG: That can happen. I don’t always pay attention to measurements.  
EC: I think you have a good sense for it. I often pick the wrong recipes.  
DG: I understand. Have you had any specific failures?  
EC: My biggest failure was making a rice cooker cake with canned peaches, and it turned out mushy.  
DG: That must have been disappointing.  
EC: Yes, it was still a letdown.  
DG: It might depend on the machine.  
EC: The anticipation of cake can make it disappointing when it doesn’t turn out well.  
DG: With a rice cooker, you can’t check the progress midway.  
EC: Exactly. Also, a cheesecake I made with pizza cheese had an unappealing taste.  
DG: You seem to experiment with a lot of sweets.  
EC: Thank you. I’ll avoid potential failures and aim for more successes.  
DG: That sounds like a good strategy.",4
2,"EC: Hello!  
DG: Hello!  
EC: Do you have any siblings?  
DG: I am an only child.  
EC: I see. When I was little, I admired being an only child.  
DG: How many siblings do you have?  
EC: I have one younger sister. We used to fight a lot when we were little, but now we get along well.  
DG: How is your relationship now?  
EC: We get along well now.  
DG: Do you prefer having a sister?  
EC: My younger sister once said she wanted an older brother.  
DG: Would that have changed your relationship?  
EC: Possibly, she might feel differently about having a brother.  
DG: My friend finds it troublesome to be very close with a sibling.  
EC: Sometimes being too close can be a problem.  
DG: They spend a lot of time together and understand each other well, but it causes concern.  
EC: Understanding each other well can be both positive and negative.  
DG: Do you meet your younger sister frequently?  
EC: It's about three hours by bullet train, so we don't meet often.  
DG: But you keep in touch through other means?  
EC: Yes, we communicate through LINE and other platforms.  
DG: That sounds effective.  
EC: Yes, it's fun to stay connected.  
DG: Relationships can evolve as we grow older.  
EC: I want my kids to get along but sometimes they fight.  
DG: My friend used to fight with his sibling but they get along now.  
EC: People can change a lot as they grow.  
DG: If you have children, how many would you like?  
EC: I think having five would be lively if financially possible.  
DG: That's something important to consider.  
EC: Yes, it's an expanding dream!  
DG: Thank you for sharing.",2
3,"EC: Hello! Nice to meet you.
AF: Hello, how can I assist you today?
EC: When I was parking, I accidentally hit the car and my mood dropped.
AF: I understand. Was it a new car?
EC: No, it was a used car from the beginning. But I'm worried about the repair costs.
AF: What kind of damage occurred?
EC: It's not very big, but even to an amateur, it's clear that the parts are misaligned.
AF: Are you concerned about visible damage and the functionality of the parts?
EC: That's right. I'm also worried that the parts might slip and fall off.
AF: That is a common concern.
EC: It's your parent's car, right? Did you get scolded?
AF: I mentioned it was hit while parked.
EC: Understood.
AF: They figured out it was me.
EC: Is it obvious?
AF: Yes, it seemed like a beginner's mistake.
EC: Parental intuition is amazing!
AF: The damage I caused was significant, like a hanging door mirror.
EC: The mirrors hang down, huh! If it were a new car, I'd probably turn pale.
AF: I was definitely pale when it happened.
EC: Certainly, it must have been tough for the parents too.
AF: Do you have any plans to go for a drive?
EC: I don't have plans to go for a drive. Do you?
AF: I'm planning an overnight trip later this summer.
EC: Sounds interesting!
AF: I usually stay without meals and find local restaurants.
EC: That sounds enjoyable!
AF: It is an effective way to save on hotel costs.
EC: I understand. Thank you for today.
AF: You're welcome!",6
4,"EC: Hello, thank you for your time today.  
AF: Thank you for reaching out.  
EC: COVID-19 can be quite concerning, can't it?  
AF: Yes, recently, wearing a mask has been tough because of the heat.  
EC: True, it feels like heatstroke is a real possibility.  
AF: I'm worried about getting mild heatstroke each year, especially when I have to go out with a mask on.  
EC: I understand. Without a mask, it can be uncomfortable with people looking, making summer harder.  
AF: Do you think the number of people wearing masks outdoors has decreased slightly?  
EC: In rural areas, many still wear masks due to COVID-19 concerns.  
AF: In my rural area, I've noticed fewer elderly people wearing masks.  
EC: I see, things are changing gradually.  
AF: I've recently stopped wearing a mask outdoors and feel less conscious about being observed.  
EC: That's good; it might help reduce heatstroke risks.  
AF: This year has been extremely hot, so I bought a parasol for children.  
EC: Children feel the heat too. Did you use a parasol for commuting to school?  
AF: A few classmates have parasols.  
EC: That makes sense; it must be hot for you when you commute.  
AF: In the morning it's manageable, but I use a parasol when I go back home.  
EC: It's hottest in the afternoon. Using a parasol seems like a smart way to stay cooler.  
AF: Yes, children's parasols are light and convenient.  
EC: I'll look for one next time I shop.  
AF: Definitely. I bought mine for less than 2,000 yen, so it's affordable.  
EC: That's great! Are you doing anything else to avoid heatstroke?  
AF: I use a cooling towel around my neck every day.  
EC: I've never tried one. Doesn't it make your neck wet?  
AF: You wet it and wring it out, but it dries quickly, especially in summer.  
EC: That sounds refreshing!  
AF: It's comfortable for both children and adults, even while doing chores.  
EC: I've learned a lot. Thank you!  
AF: You're welcome.",1
5,"EC: Hello, nice to meet you!  
AF: Hello, how can I assist you today?  
EC: I've been thinking about cleaning up the house but can't seem to get started.  
AF: What areas are you planning to clean up?  
EC: Toys and children's clothes that are no longer used. They hold memories, so it's hard to throw them away.  
AF: Have you thought about taking photos before disposing of them?  
EC: Photos are a great idea! It helps preserve the memories.  
AF: Yes, taking photos can help you remember them.  
EC: It's a good idea to take photos before getting rid of crafts and works.  
AF: You can create a digital album to look through anytime.  
EC: Creating an album for works sounds great! I've considered it but haven't started yet.  
AF: Avoid accumulation. Order prints online promptly after taking photos.  
EC: Do you order immediately and store them as soon as they arrive?  
AF: Yes, and I discreetly dispose of broken items.  
EC: That's helpful. Have you ever been scolded for secretly throwing things away?  
AF: Most people focus more on the creation process than the item itself.  
EC: Definitely, the peak of crafting is finishing it.  
AF: Correct. The process is often the most enjoyable part.  
EC: Especially with things like paper clay. I might take a photo and throw it away secretly.  
AF: I recommend it. Your home will be more organized.  
EC: It's important to have a comfortable home. Children's rooms get so messy, it's disheartening.  
AF: Give them a garbage bag and ask them to throw away what they don't need.  
EC: That’s a good approach. In our house, we can't throw anything away because everything has memories.  
AF: Regularly clearing items helps keep things in order.  
EC: Tidying up seems to reflect one's parents' habits. My parents also struggle with throwing things away, and so do I.  
AF: My mother also used to throw things away.  
EC: That’s interesting! Thank you for sharing this.  
AF: You're welcome, happy to help.",4
6,"EC: Hello, nice to meet you.  
AF: Hello, how can I assist you today?  
EC: I'm considering buying a new computer. Could you provide some information on the specs of your computer?  
AF: It runs the latest version of Windows.  
EC: Understood. My current devices often freeze or have slow updates, which is quite frustrating.  
AF: You might want to consider a budget-friendly second-hand computer.  
EC: Could you explain how to select a reliable second-hand computer and which store might be best?  
AF: Check Rakuten for prices and consult a technical expert to confirm the choice.  
EC: Noted, I’ll do that.  
AF: Yes, relying on a technical expert is always helpful.  
EC: At my place, I need to make the choice myself since I use the computer often.  
AF: Consulting with a store expert could help reduce mistakes.  
EC: Good point. Seeking advice from store personnel seems like a good way to make an informed choice.  
AF: Smartphones today are so advanced, making them difficult to choose from.  
EC: There are indeed many options. I'm interested in trying the Google Pixel.  
AF: I recently upgraded my smartphone.  
EC: Which smartphone did you switch to?  
AF: The latest 5G model from Tone Mobile.  
EC: I've heard a lot about 5G.  
AF: It runs smoother than my previous phone.  
EC: Does 5G actually affect speed? I’m not sure how significant the difference is.  
AF: Recent smartphones have surprisingly good cameras.  
EC: True, but my budget smartphone has a disappointing zoom function.  
AF: For serious photography, I prefer a digital single-lens reflex camera.  
EC: That seems like the right approach for high-quality photos.  
AF: I struggle to keep up with the latest technology.  
EC: Same here. Thank you very much for the information!  
AF: You're welcome. Thank you!",4
7,"EC: Hello.
AF: Hello.
EC: Watching any shows or anime?
AF: Yes, Naruto and Bleach.
EC: Both are great.
AF: Familiar with them?
EC: Read some of Naruto. Want to binge-read it.
AF: Both have long-running anime.
EC: Are they still airing?
AF: Naruto's anime is complete.
EC: Got it. I want to watch it.
AF: Naruto grows a lot.
EC: Understood.
AF: His growth is noticeable.
EC: There's a sequel, right?
AF: Yes, 'Boruto: Naruto Next Generations.'
EC: Acknowledged.
AF: Naruto's partner is surprising.
EC: Haven't reached that part yet.
AF: Noted. Started Bleach recently.
EC: Bankai is cool.
AF: Jujutsu Kaisen is popular, but I prefer Bleach.
EC: Haven't seen Jujutsu Kaisen. Bleach characters are distinct.
AF: Got hooked. Want to watch the movies.
EC: There's a movie?
AF: Yes, with Fukushi-kun and Hana-chan.
EC: Want to see it.
AF: It's on Netflix.
EC: Don't have Netflix. Will find another way. Thanks.
AF: You're welcome.",15
8,"EC: Good evening!
AF: Good evening!
EC: Do you have your air conditioner cleaned every year? It's expensive, isn't it?
AF: I don't do it every year; it's about once every three years.
EC: Once every three years is fine. The company told me it should be done every year.
AF: It might be time to replace the air conditioner.
EC: Air conditioners are expensive, aren't they?
AF: I sometimes think that cleaning on my own with a spray is enough.
EC: I've seen a spray at the pharmacy! Does it get clean?
AF: I haven't tried it yet. It might break.
EC: You're worried it might break, aren't you?
AF: I'd prefer to do the maintenance myself rather than outsourcing it.
EC: I see. It makes me want to save money.
AF: The more things you can do on your own, the more you can save.
EC: I think so! Are you good at saving money?
AF: I'm not good at saving money in small ways, so I invest instead.
EC: You're investing, right? Is it through something like NISA?
AF: I invest in both NISA and iDeCo, but within my savings limits.
EC: What did you study to learn this?
AF: Books and learning while managing it.
EC: You read the book and then put it into practice, right? Aren't you afraid of taking losses?
AF: In shopping, there are times when you make mistakes and lose out. That's how I feel.
EC: That's a useful perspective.
AF: Since it's within my financial means, even if I lose money, it won't be significant.
EC: So it's best to keep it to an amount that you can accept losing.
AF: I think so. I'm bad at regular shopping and often fail.
EC: I see! I'm starting to feel like I want to invest.
AF: Investing in Rakuten Points has low risk and is easy to start.
EC: I've seen information about investing with Rakuten points! I'll check it out. Thank you very much.
AF: You're welcome, thank you.",2
