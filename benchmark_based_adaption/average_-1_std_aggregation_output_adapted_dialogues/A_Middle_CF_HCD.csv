1,"CF: Good evening!
BW: Good evening. How are you dealing with the heat?
CF: Thanks for asking! Except for the cavities, I'm fine.
BW: I need to go to the dentist soon too.
CF: Severe pain in June made me start going.
BW: I usually wait until it’s necessary.
CF: Regular check-ups after treatment are a hassle.
BW: Dental treatments are lengthy and follow-ups are time-consuming.
CF: Yes. I have multiple cavities, so I'll be going for a while.
BW: I stopped going after an issue was fixed two years ago.
CF: I did the same three years ago.
BW: Dental problems often recur. Finding the right dentist is key.
CF: It’s tough with so many options.
BW: Reviews can help, but personal experience is crucial.
CF: True. Reviews can be misleading.
BW: Popular doesn't always mean best.
CF: My last dentist didn’t suit me either.
BW: Dental work can lead to food getting stuck, which is frustrating.
CF: That’s annoying.
BW: Braces can cause sensitivity.
CF: They are expensive and irritating.
BW: Reporting issues doesn't always help.
CF: Dental costs are high, which is tough.
BW: It's important to handle issues properly.
CF: Voicing concerns can be difficult.
BW: My friend communicated their issues later.
CF: Were they resolved?
BW: Yes, but with an additional fee.
CF: Understood. Thanks for the information.
BW: You're welcome.",12
2,"CF: Good evening!  
BW: Hello. Do you usually exercise?  
CF: No, I haven't had the time.  
BW: I also haven't been exercising regularly due to being busy.  
CF: I tried water walking at the municipal pool and planned to go weekly.  
BW: Is underwater walking effective exercise?  
CF: Yes, it is. I walk back and forth in the 50m pool and sometimes swim using the flutter kick.  
BW: Can you still swim normally?  
CF: I used to do the crawl and breaststroke, but probably not now.  
BW: It would be good to have space to swim.  
CF: The pool is less crowded in the evening; it's open until 9 PM.  
BW: Some pools have designated swimming and walking areas.  
CF: Yes, that's helpful.  
BW: Regular attendance can be challenging.  
CF: It takes determination to maintain the routine.  
BW: Without a goal, it's difficult. I just stretch at home sometimes.  
CF: I only stretch after long computer sessions.  
BW: Prolonged computer use can cause stiffness.  
CF: Yes, it affects blood flow.  
BW: My shoulders and lower back are sore too. I want to find time to exercise.  
CF: Finding time is difficult when busy.  
BW: It often gets postponed.  
CF: I completely understand!  
BW: An app might help maintain consistency.  
CF: Smartwatches and smartphones can help with that.  
BW: They're useful for tracking exercise.  
CF: I also use my smartphone to track my sleep.  
BW: These devices can monitor sleep and heart rate.  
CF: Yes, it's very convenient. Thank you for the talk!  
BW: You're welcome.",6
3,"CF: Good evening! Nice to meet you.
BW: Nice to meet you too. What have you been into recently?
CF: Casual cycling.
BW: What's pottering? I've never heard of it.
CF: It means aimlessly wandering around on a bicycle.
BW: Do you explore the city or nature?
CF: I prefer exploring the city.
BW: I'll check it out on YouTube.
CF: I recommend Shibuya pottering videos.
BW: Thanks for the tip. What are you into recently?
CF: Practicing the ukulele again.
BW: You play the ukulele? That's impressive!
CF: I used to play. I'm practicing again after watching videos.
BW: What songs are you practicing?
CF: Hawaiian and Western songs.
BW: That sounds cool. Do you listen to music?
CF: Yes, Japanese music and game soundtracks.
BW: What game soundtracks?
CF: From games like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger.
BW: Final Fantasy music is famous.
CF: Yes, I still enjoy it.
BW: Game music is wonderful. Koichi Sugiyama from Dragon Quest passed away.
CF: He was great. I hope his legacy continues.
BW: Indeed, game music is something Japan can be proud of.
CF: I agree. Thank you for the conversation!
BW: Thank you.",2
4,"CF: Good morning. It's sunny and refreshing this morning.
BQ: Good morning. It is raining here.
CF: Is it a typhoon?
BQ: Possibly.
CF: It rained heavily here yesterday. Be careful.
BQ: Thanks. Heavy rain is common lately.
CF: Yes, flooding is scary.
BQ: Have you experienced flood damage?
CF: A bridge over the nearby river collapsed once. How about you?
BQ: My town is okay, but the neighboring town floods often.
CF: Cleaning up after floods is tough.
BQ: Yes, and it smells bad.
CF: Things spoil quickly in summer.
BQ: Does insurance cover flood damage?
CF: I'm not sure. It's concerning.
BQ: Fire insurance usually requires total damage. I'm worried.
CF: Understood.
BQ: Are you doing anything for disaster prevention?
CF: I've prepared some stockpiles, but not enough.
BQ: We should prepare.
CF: Yes, some cookies last five years.
BQ: There are also ones rehydrated with water. They seem useful.
CF: I heard they're good. I'd like to try them.
BQ: It's good to get used to them. Hopefully, we won't need them.
CF: True. Floods are scary, but earthquakes are scarier.
BQ: A big earthquake is predicted. We have to prepare.
CF: I keep thinking ""This year will come!"" but I'm still not ready.
BQ: It's hard to think about disasters.
CF: I tend to avoid it. Thanks for the talk!
BQ: Thank you.",6
5,"CF: Good morning.
BQ: Good morning. It's Obon, do you have any plans?
CF: We should visit the grave, but due to COVID-19, we're not doing it this year.
BQ: Understood. I went yesterday since I live nearby.
CF: It's pretty hot at the cemetery, right?
BQ: Yes, it was very hot. I was drenched in sweat.
CF: Your ancestors must be pleased. Any other plans for the holidays?
BQ: I plan to visit a nearby hot spring.
CF: Do you go often?
BQ: I stay overnight about once a year, but frequently go on day trips.
CF: That sounds nice.
BQ: Do you like hot springs?
CF: Yes, I used to visit super sento a lot in the past.
BQ: Super sento is comfortable enough to spend an entire day there.
CF: Some places now are like manga cafes and seem fun.
BQ: I enjoyed taking naps in a theater-like room.
CF: Yes, it’s comfortable.
BQ: The rice dishes are delicious, like ramen.
CF: Snacks and beer are also good.
BQ: It's the best right after a bath.
CF: That could easily be me!
BQ: Some places also offer overnight stays.
CF: It’s convenient if you miss the last train.
BQ: Good to know.
CF: If I miss the last train, I'd prefer staying overnight at a super sento.
BQ: Manga cafes are cramped with only showers, right?
CF: Yes. It’s best to go home without staying over.
BQ: Do you usually commute by train?
CF: No, I work from home.
BQ: Working from home sounds nice. Thank you.
CF: See you later!",2
6,"CF: Good morning. Are you the type of person who gets up early and stays active in the morning?  
BQ: Good morning. I usually wake up around 7:30.  
CF: I see. I wake up around 5 a.m. on weekdays.  
BQ: That's early. Do you engage in any morning activities?  
CF: Ideally, I would take a walk, but I'm busy preparing things for my family.  
BQ: That sounds demanding. Try to rest when possible.  
CF: I wake up early to make bento. I value sleep, so I want to maximize it.  
BQ: Consider using frozen foods to simplify the process.  
CF: Do you use frozen food often? What do you prefer in your lunchbox?  
BQ: I prefer grilled salted salmon.  
CF: Understood. It is a classic choice.  
BQ: Even cold, it's still tasty. Do you have any favorite bento side dishes?  
CF: I like kinpira and shibazuke.  
BQ: Understood. I prefer sweet kinpira.  
CF: White sesame seeds enhance the flavor.  
BQ: How many years have you been making bento?  
CF: This is my 13th year.  
BQ: That’s over a decade of experience.  
CF: Thank you. Despite this, I find tamagoyaki challenging.  
BQ: Do you prefer sweet or savory tamagoyaki?  
CF: I prefer salty, but I make it sweet for the person eating it.  
BQ: I prefer sweet ones. How do you achieve the store-bought look?  
CF: Wrapping them well is difficult.  
BQ: Is there a bento side dish you're especially confident in?  
CF: Hamburger steak and kinpira.  
BQ: They seem more complex than tamagoyaki.  
CF: I prepare them the day before, so I only need to pack them.  
BQ: Prepared meals are convenient. Good strategy to prepare them ahead.  
CF: I could make it in the morning, but I prefer to sleep more! Thank you for the conversation.  
BQ: Thank you.",2
7,"CF: Good morning. I thought I would buy something I want since payday is next week.  
BQ: Good morning. What do you have in mind?  
CF: I want a display that can be connected to a computer.  
BQ: Displays are great. There are various types available.  
CF: I want to connect it to a laptop and have two screens.  
BQ: That’s a multi-display setup. It should make your work more efficient.  
CF: I also want to watch videos while working.  
BQ: That sounds nice. I’m also looking for a display but haven't found a good one yet.  
CF: It’s difficult to choose when there are many options.  
BQ: I am considering getting a monitor arm.  
CF: He’s impressive. I admire him.  
BQ: I want to move the monitor around a lot. I’m aiming for a Japanese-made one, but even the used ones are expensive.  
CF: That’s quite a price. It’s something to think about.  
BQ: I’ve heard it reduces eye strain significantly. Higher cost often means better performance.  
CF: I see, I didn’t know that.  
BQ: We should take care of our eyes when using the computer for long periods.  
CF: I understand. I got blue light blocking glasses.  
BQ: How effective are they?  
CF: They’re like lightly tinted sunglasses.  
BQ: Is there a noticeable difference when you don’t wear them?  
CF: The brightness feels different.  
BQ: So, it feels darker?  
CF: Yes, you can really tell the difference compared to glasses without blue light cut.  
BQ: I see. I’ll consider it as well.  
CF: Certainly! The only drawback is they can reflect blue light depending on the viewing angle.  
BQ: That sounds unusual. It might look a bit cool though.  
CF: When elementary school students see it, they think it’s cool.  
BQ: It sounds like the Terminator.  
CF: It looks like that, doesn't it! I couldn’t help but laugh. Thanks for the chat!  
BQ: Thank you as well.",1
8,"CF: Good morning. It's a bit cool this morning, isn't it?
BZ: Good morning. It's incredibly humid!
CF: I see! It might be because the weather is going to get worse.
BZ: That's right. I'll go visit the grave while the weather holds.
CF: Is it Obon now?
BZ: Yes. The sense of seasons is disappearing.
CF: Cemeteries are hot because there are no shaded areas, right?
BZ: Correct. You should go soon!
CF: It seems like going in the morning would be best. There's a typhoon here, so I'm staying home.
BZ: Ah, did the Kanto region get a direct hit today?
CF: Yes, but it's sunny now, so I'm not sure what will happen.
BZ: If we prepare, the typhoon might not come, right?
CF: That's true. We're quite well-prepared this time.
BZ: Yes. The typhoon is moving towards unprepared places.
CF: They might not come here. It's good, but a bit frustrating.
BZ: And then, if you're off guard, it will come!
CF: When you've used up all your stockpiled food, right? I understand!
BZ: In any case, let's hope it doesn't get worse!
CF: Thank you. I wanted to go out to eat, so I'll consider it while keeping an eye on the situation.
BZ: However, it is humid. The room temperature is already 31 degrees.
CF: That's high! It feels more humid here.
BZ: There is a nice breeze outside. I'll cut some bellflowers from the garden and take them to the grave.
CF: Having bellflowers in the garden is nice.
BZ: I liked them so much that I divided and replanted them many times. Now my garden is full of bellflowers.
CF: That's nice! I'm envious because it's hard to do that on a condominium balcony.
BZ: We live on the second and third floors. There's a small garden or flower bed on the first floor.
CF: Oh! I let my cherry tomato plant wither the other day.
BZ: That was unfortunate. Did you not eat any at all?
CF: Actually, I was quite satisfied with what I managed to achieve! I'll do my best next time. Thank you for the conversation!
BZ: Thank you very much, too!",2
