1,"AX: Good evening. Nice to meet you.
AN: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
AX: Do you drink alcohol?
AN: Yes, I do. How about you?
AX: Sometimes. I recently visited an interesting bar.
AN: Could you describe the bar?
AX: The customers were unique.
AN: How were they unique?
AX: Mostly people in their 70s or older.
AN: That’s unusual.
AX: Their conversations were surprising.
AN: What did they talk about?
AX: Someone mentioned they fell and needed stitches.
AN: That sounds serious.
AX: The entrance wasn't high, but it was startling.
AN: Is it safe for them to be drinking?
AX: It was a grandmother.
AN: She should probably rest.
AX: The bar is in Higashi-Mikuni. The bartender was in her 40s.
AN: Higashi-Mikuni has interesting shops.
AX: The bartender seemed younger compared to the customers.
AN: Someone in their 40s would indeed seem younger there.
AX: Yes, but the atmosphere wasn't very lively.
AN: Was it lively at all?
AX: Only for a moment. I was cautious when leaving.
AN: Good idea to avoid injuries.
AX: We're joining the ranks of older folks.
AN: My husband once got so drunk he broke his tooth.
AX: That’s dangerous. Take care.
AN: Will do. Let's both be careful.",10
2,"AX: Thank you for your hard work. Looking forward to collaborating.
AN: Thank you for your hard work. Please handle it!
AX: What kind of alcohol do you prefer?
AN: Beer and wine.
AX: Nice. I enjoy standing wine bars.
AN: Haven't been out recently.
AX: Same here in Osaka. Just twice.
AN: High rate for peculiar bars.
AX: Checked it out again.
AN: A second visit?
AX: Yes, it intrigued me.
AN: Any interesting events?
AX: Same type of customers. That's the place.
AN: Likely older regulars.
AX: Felt strange for my first Osaka bar visit in a while.
AN: Don't be discouraged, there are better bars.
AX: Is that so? Still feels unreal.
AN: Osaka has many good spots, and Kyoto has wonderful bars too.
AX: Kyoto has a great atmosphere.
AN: Many bars with great atmospheres. Wide whiskey selection in Kyoto.
AX: I'd like to visit.
AN: Please do if you can.
AX: Sure. I'll explore more. Haven't been to Kyoto much.
AN: COVID-19 made going out hard.
AX: Yes, most shops were closed in the first year.
AN: Almost all stores had shutters down.
AX: Recently felt like going out, but with cases rising, it's tricky.
AN: Just as shortened hours ended.
AX: Yes. That's why drinking at home is common.
AN: Same here. Hoping for normal life soon.",4
3,"AX: Good evening. Thank you in advance.
BG: Good evening. The equipment from Kamakura Seisakusho is too expensive.
AX: If you carry that, it looks heavy.
BG: It feels like you're carrying the device on your back, right? That seems exhausting because it's too heavy.
AX: It is. By the way, I just remembered something. May I talk about a different topic?
BG: Yes, please.
AX: Have you ever had an interview or meeting with any staff at work?
BG: Not recently, but I do have memories from the past.
AX: In the past, there was one interview that made me laugh.
BG: What happened? It sounds like a comedy sketch. Please tell me.
AX: There was a 27-year-old woman I interviewed. I asked her what the most enjoyable job she had so far.
BG: The interviewer is your older brother, right? Not the one being interviewed.
AX: Yes, that's right. I attended the interview just in case. Do you know what she said was fun?
BG: What could it be? Was it suspicious behavior?
AX: She said the most enjoyable job she ever had was being a shrine maiden.
BG: A shrine maiden? That's unexpected.
AX: Yes. And when she answered, something strange happened.
BG: Did she re-enact her work?
AX: That would have been interesting, but it was her face. It wasn't good.
BG: Not a re-enactment, but her face? How bad was it?
AX: Snot was dripping from her nose and had reached her mouth.
BG: Why? Was it hay fever?
AX: I don't know. I couldn't ask or look at her face after that.
BG: Right. I wonder if she noticed?
AX: I couldn't ask. Then, when I asked what job she'd like to try next, she said shrine maiden again.
BG: What was her reason for applying to your brother's company?
AX: Shrine maidens retire at 26. I didn't know that.
BG: So, she can't be a shrine maiden anymore. Did she pass the interview?
AX: I declined her, but another person was hired. Later, since she still had a runny nose, I asked the sales department to address it.
BG: Wow. You were lucky. You are a lucky woman.",1
4,"AX: Good evening. Thank you in advance.
BG: Good evening. Do you have any fears?
AX: I try to be careful with my words.
BG: How about ghosts in the summer?
AX: Ghosts? Is your sister scary?
BG: No, your language is fine. I need to be cautious.
AX: In Hakodate, some people were influenced by parents from Aomori.
BG: Like a religion?
AX: No, I worked as an Itako. Does that worry you?
BG: Itako sounds scary. I scare easily.
AX: Don't be too scared. Curiosity isn't good.
BG: It's the darkness after such stories that scares me.
AX: Yes, it's unpleasant. People in those professions can be scary.
BG: Have you met such people? Were you okay?
AX: Some saw things and were scared. Their son also went to the hospital.
BG: This feels like an unknown type of fear.
AX: You can prevent some fear by paying attention to what you see and hear.
BG: How so?
AX: Watching news about Ukraine daily can make you feel down.
BG: Yes, it does.
AX: Seeing news about rising prices can be depressing.
BG: I stopped watching the news because it made me anxious.
AX: It's important to be cautious about daily information, including spiritual matters.
BG: Got it. Thanks for explaining.
AX: No problem. Information keeps coming like push notifications.
BG: Yes, there's so much that I avoid TV now.
AX: Me too. I used to choose my own books. I'm worried about the kids.
BG: Everything being online is concerning. We need balance.
AX: Yes. Looking at screens can strain your eyes.
BG: Hazuki Loupe helps me.",7
5,"AX: Good evening. I look forward to working with you.
BG: Good evening. Thank you, likewise!
AX: Speaking of which, did we talk about AI?
BG: No, we haven't talked about that.
AX: I see. Do you have any opportunities to use or touch it closely?
BG: Hmm, no. It's far from cutting edge.
AX: It seems that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the chatbots at inquiry desks have rapidly started utilizing AI.
BG: Indeed, connection identified. I have utilized the inquiry desk frequently.
AX: Yeah. Recently, when you access the website, ""Do you need any help?"" appears at the bottom right, right?
BG: This feature requires user engagement at least once.
AX: It's annoying, right? It was originally terrible in Japanese, but it improved all at once.
BG: This feature is ineffective during critical situations.
AX: I think they are probably using a cheap type.
BG: Utilizing AI from a reputable company may offer better performance.
AX: Most good ones generally use IBM's Watson as their base.
BG: Confirmed: Watson is a reliable choice.
AX: Yes. The famous one in Japan is Pepper-kun.
BG: Pepper is commonly found in restaurants.
AX: That’s it. The appearance is a facade, and inside, it's just Watson.
BG: Implementing such systems can be costly.
AX: That would cost tens of millions if we tried to implement it properly.
BG: Implementation is time-consuming and complex.
AX: Trying out with 300 or so. It seems they are improving accuracy with both machine learning and deep learning.
BG: Understood. There is a tiered accuracy system.
AX: Listening, hearing, and trying to hear are analogous systems to machine learning.
BG: Understood.
AX: Deep learning differentiates between ""kiku"" meaning chrysanthemum, ""kiku"" meaning to listen, and ""kiku"" meaning to ask, as they are used in different contexts.
BG: This distinction is highly specialized.
AX: It seems that it can only understand 0 and 1, so it makes judgments by doing that in tens of thousands of ways.
BG: This process is fascinating upon detailed examination.",1
6,"AX: Good evening. Let's get started.
AG: Good evening. Ready to assist you.
AX: Many people prefer cold things in summer. Do you?
AG: I avoid them as they can harm your body.
AX: Do you have many warm alternatives?
AG: I usually choose soup or room-temperature tea.
AX: So seasons don't change your preferences much?
AG: Correct. How about you?
AX: I like cold things in summer and warm ones in winter.
AG: Do you enjoy ice cream too?
AX: Yes, I do. What about you?
AG: Yes, even though I try to avoid cold things, ice cream is delicious.
AX: Agreed. There's an Ice Expo happening near me.
AG: Is that an event with various ice creams?
AX: Yes, they gathered from all over Japan after three years.
AG: From all over Japan? Did you visit it?
AX: Yes, I went today.
AG: How was it?
AX: Fresh waffle cones with buns and soft serve on top.
AG: Sounds great. But you can't eat too much, right?
AX: Right. I could only eat one. Many other options were available.
AG: Hard to pick just one when everything looks good.
AX: Exactly. Yamanashi had various fruit sherbets.
AG: Yamanashi’s fruits like grapes, pears, and peaches are delicious.
AX: They also had one covered with mandarin oranges and whipped ice cream inside.
AG: That sounds unique and interesting.
AX: It was. They also had macaron ice, which was popular.
AG: I wonder if it will be sold at convenience stores.
AX: Convenience stores make buying easy. I hope so.
AG: That would be convenient!",3
7,"AX: Good evening. Thank you in advance.
AG: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
AX: Speaking of which, do you prefer hot drinks?
AG: I prefer warm drinks. How about you?
AX: I am fine with either. Do you drink coffee?
AG: Yes, I usually have 1 or 2 cups a day.
AX: I see. I had an opportunity to listen to the CEO of Starbucks Japan a while ago.
AG: That sounds interesting. How did that happen?
AX: I called him at the office. By the way, he said the coffee at 7-Eleven is delicious.
AG: That's good to know.
AX: He also mentioned that cultivating empathy among staff members is left to each individual.
AG: Did you find that useful?
AX: For example, if there is someone who has been in an accident nearby, the clerk will look out the window and hand over coffee based on their judgment.
AG: They offer free coffee in such situations out of empathy.
AX: Yes, it seems that the clerk did it voluntarily.
AG: Would you do the same?
AX: I think they went to talk to them, but I don't know if they were able to make coffee. They must have been very empathetic.
AG: That shows a great level of empathy indeed.
AX: That's suitable for Starbucks. I think it's good.
AG: Agreed.
AX: A while ago, when I went to Starbucks, I was impressed by something.
AG: What was it?
AX: A young girl could only communicate in writing, probably because she was deaf, but she was a store clerk.
AG: I see. That's admirable.
AX: At that time, I couldn't hear, so it was an original menu with a cute illustration asking to point here.
AG: That's a thoughtful approach.
AX: The surrounding store clerks only helped when I was in trouble and left me alone otherwise.
AG: That makes it more comfortable for everyone.
AX: I see. As a customer, I felt grateful.
AG: It seems everyone contributes to a positive atmosphere.",9
8,"AX: Good evening. I'm looking forward to collaborating with you.
AG: Good evening! I am here to assist you.
AX: In summer, shaved ice is popular at storefronts. Do you ever have it?
AG: I bought some recently as it looked delicious.
AX: Have you eaten it yet?
AG: Yes, it was made from water from a well-known source, which they froze.
AX: That sounds authentic. What kind was it?
AG: It had a clear taste with homemade syrup, sold at a cake shop.
AX: A cake shop? Interesting. There's also a nearby shaved ice shop.
AG: Have you visited it?
AX: Not yet, but it's sold at a dumpling shop.
AG: I wonder if there's something special about it.
AX: Shaved ice these days often has various toppings, right?
AG: Certainly, they focus on the presentation.
AX: This one is topped with three-colored dumplings.
AG: Three-colored dango! True to a dumpling shop.
AX: It's a lot, but it piques my interest.
AG: It seems like chilled zenzai. Is there shiratama?
AX: I like them, but I'm undecided because there are three colors.
AG: The texture might be similar to dumplings. Any sweet red bean paste?
AX: I didn't notice any. Recently, there are various kinds like fluffy and creamy ones.
AG: It's a trend from Taiwanese shaved ice.
AX: Have you tried Taiwanese shaved ice?
AG: I've seen it on TV. The mango flavor looks appealing.
AX: The visuals are striking.
AG: Flavoring the ice itself is surprising.
AX: Flavoring the ice? I never thought of that.
AG: It keeps the ice fluffy and prevents it from sinking in the syrup. I want to try it!
AX: I understand it now. Thank you.
AG: You're welcome! Hopefully, we can both try it someday.",1
