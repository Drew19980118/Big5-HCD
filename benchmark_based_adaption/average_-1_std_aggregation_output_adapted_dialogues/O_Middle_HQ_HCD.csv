1,"HQ: Hello  
GR: Hello  
HQ: How would you use 100,000 yen?  
GR: Pay off debt.  
HQ: Do you have debt?  
GR: Yes, a scholarship to repay.  
HQ: That must be difficult.  
GR: I want to repay it quickly.  
HQ: Are there scholarship exemptions available?  
GR: Yes, but those who repay early miss out.  
HQ: Would it be fair to default?  
GR: If it were fair, I wouldn't repay.  
HQ: I understand.  
GR: I also used benefits to repay loans.  
HQ: Interesting. I invested mine.  
GR: Did it increase?  
HQ: A little.  
GR: Good for you.  
HQ: Have you tried investing?  
GR: No.  
HQ: Are you interested?  
GR: Feels risky.  
HQ: It can be, but worth studying after your loan is repaid.  
GR: True, money won't grow otherwise.  
HQ: Exactly, let money work for you.  
GR: Correct.",8
2,"HQ: Good evening.
GR: Good evening.
HQ: Do you have an ideal way to spend a holiday?
GR: ""Two days of a three-day weekend for travel, and one day for rest is ideal.""
HQ: Traveling for all three days can be tiring, right?
GR: Understood. I want to spend the first day doing household chores and relaxing at home.
HQ: That makes sense.
GR: Do you have an ideal way to spend your holidays, Bask?
HQ: I prefer to spend time slowly.
GR: Do you go out at all?
HQ: I usually stay in. There’s nowhere specific I want to go.
GR: What do you do at home?
HQ: I watch anime and cook.
GR: Cooking? It seems like you can make elaborate dishes.
HQ: But I usually don’t put in much effort if it’s just for myself.
GR: I understand. It’s more motivating to cook for others, isn’t it?
HQ: Exactly, because I want it to turn out well.
GR: Absolutely.
HQ: I’ve also started enjoying taking walks recently.
GR: It’s cooler now, so it’s easier to go for a walk, isn’t it?
HQ: Yes. It’s harder to walk in winter, so I’m trying to stay active while I can.
GR: In winter, you tend to stay indoors, right?
HQ: Pretty much.
GR: In winter, I stay at home and watch anime and dramas.
HQ: During the New Year holidays especially, I stay under the kotatsu.
GR: The only things to do are visiting the shrine or hitting the sales.
HQ: I do my New Year’s shopping online.
GR: You shop online?
HQ: Yes, like lucky bags; they’re often more available online.
GR: Got it.",1
3,"HQ: Good evening.
GR: Good evening.
HQ: Do you ever feel like you've become an adult?
GR: When I see my face aging.
HQ: My face is sagging too.
GR: Hard to fix sagging.
HQ: Not much can be done.
GR: I also have rough skin and dark circles.
HQ: Have you tried dermatology treatments?
GR: Too expensive.
HQ: Yes, they are.
GR: Hard to justify the cost.
HQ: Thought about a thread lift.
GR: Have you tried it?
HQ: No, it's 100,000 yen and lasts six months.
GR: Not cost-effective.
HQ: Exactly, too costly.
GR: Any alternatives for sagging?
HQ: HIFU, but also 100,000 yen.
GR: How long does it last?
HQ: Around six months.
GR: Still not cost-effective.
HQ: Beauty clinics profit a lot.
GR: Prices should be lower.
HQ: Treatments are cheaper in South Korea.
GR: It's a big beauty hub.
HQ: Affordable options here would be nice.
GR: Hopefully, prices will drop.",10
4,"HQ: Good evening.  
GR: Good evening.  
HQ: Would you prefer a low-paying enjoyable job or a high-paying boring job?  
GR: Is the salary high?  
HQ: Why is that important?  
GR: Without enough money, life gets tough.  
HQ: Understood. But isn't it hard to handle a boring job every day?  
GR: Financial security matters.  
HQ: So, money is your priority?  
GR: Yes. Enjoyable jobs might exploit motivation.  
HQ: That’s a common issue.  
GR: Fun should be in hobbies.  
HQ: Agreed.  
GR: What's your choice?  
HQ: If I can sustain myself, I'd pick a fun job.  
GR: Even with a lower salary?  
HQ: Yes, I need enjoyment to avoid stress.  
GR: Makes sense.  
HQ: If the pay were much higher, I might reconsider.  
GR: Both choices might lead to regret.  
HQ: Would you regret not enjoying life?  
GR: Just having a job can be enough sometimes.  
HQ: True.  
GR: Like during illness or a recession.  
HQ: Another financial crisis is terrifying.  
GR: Restructuring is scary.  
HQ: Developing technical skills is crucial.  
GR: Connections are important too.  
HQ: Yes, they matter a lot.  
GR: Exactly.",4
5,"HQ: Good evening.
GR: Good evening.
HQ: Today was tough due to a hangover.
GR: Did you drink yesterday?
HQ: Yes, I did.
GR: Hangovers can be difficult.
HQ: The whole morning was unproductive. It was the last day of the long weekend.
GR: That's unfortunate.
HQ: Indeed, I regret it.
GR: Consider using the amino acid supplement from Ajinomoto to prevent hangovers.
HQ: Is that effective?
GR: Yes, it's recommended.
HQ: I'll research it.
GR: Please do.
HQ: I used to handle alcohol better, but now I feel my age.
GR: Your liver function might be declining.
HQ: My health metrics are worsening.
GR: In that case, reducing alcohol consumption might help.
HQ: I knew it was a bad idea but couldn't resist.
GR: Was there a specific reason for drinking?
HQ: I found a drink I like at the store.
GR: That can make it tempting to drink.
HQ: I ended up drinking a lot.
GR: What kind of alcohol was it?
HQ: It was sake.
GR: Drinking sake excessively isn't advisable.
HQ: Yes, it's a poor habit.
GR: Are you feeling better now?
HQ: Yes, I am.
GR: I'm glad to hear that.",1
6,"HQ: Good evening.
GR: Good evening.
HQ: Are you in a relationship?
GR: No, I haven't been here for about a year.
HQ: Which do you value more, appearance or personality?
GR: Initially, appearance.
HQ: If the appearance isn't appealing, is it a deal-breaker?
GR: Yes, there are limits.
HQ: Clothing and hairstyles can change, but other aspects are harder, right?
GR: Body shape can't change immediately.
HQ: I've dated someone slightly overweight before.
GR: Did they lose weight?
HQ: No, we dated for about a year, but it didn't work out.
GR: Weight loss is difficult, right?
HQ: I had to eat a lot for my job at a food company.
GR: That makes weight management tougher.
HQ: We could have adjusted eating habits.
GR: Was weight a reason for the breakup?
HQ: It was a factor, not the only one.
GR: It affects attraction, correct?
HQ: If gaining weight now, likely to gain more later.
GR: Losing weight gets harder with age.
HQ: It lessens appeal.
GR: I prefer well-groomed hairstyles and body shapes, including facial hair.
HQ: I know someone with a thick beard.
GR: Hair removal might help.
HQ: If shaving causes a blue tint, hair removal could be better.
GR: That's correct.
HQ: Beard hair removal is painful.
GR: It requires effort.",2
7,"HQ: Hello.
GR: Hello.
HQ: Planning a trip?
GR: No, but it's cheaper now.
HQ: There's a new government campaign.
GR: Different from GOTO Travel?
HQ: Not sure yet.
GR: Did you use GOTO Travel?
HQ: Stayed at a hotel, didn't travel.
GR: Was it affordable?
HQ: Yes, 2000 yen per night.
GR: That's cheap.
HQ: Only used it once, wish I used it more.
GR: I'll use it this time.
HQ: Good idea. Thinking of a hot spring.
GR: Hot springs are great for autumn.
HQ: Perfect season.
GR: Weather can be unstable; might bathe in the rain.
HQ: Could be interesting.
GR: Do you think outdoor baths close in heavy rain?
HQ: Open in light rain, heavy rain might be different.
GR: Water might get cold.
HQ: That's true.
GR: Where would you go for a hot spring?
HQ: Somewhere focused on hot springs, not sightseeing.
GR: A place with many hot springs would be better.
HQ: Less crowded if we avoid popular spots.
GR: If not mainstream, then where?
HQ: Every prefecture has such places.
GR: Noted.",10
8,"HQ: Hello
GR: Hello
HQ: Do you usually drive a car?
GR: I don't have a license.
HQ: Really? Have you considered getting one?
GR: Living in Tokyo, I don't really feel the need.
HQ: That makes sense.
GR: Do you drive?
HQ: I have a license, but I don't drive much.
GR: Do you want a car?
HQ: It would be convenient, but the maintenance costs are high.
GR: It could be useful for families.
HQ: Yes, if it were a hobby, I might get one, but it’s not.
GR: I'll buy a car when self-driving becomes standard.
HQ: Do you prefer not to drive yourself?
GR: Yes, it's scary to think about hitting someone.
HQ: An accident seems almost inevitable at some point.
GR: It would be fine to hit something minor, but a serious accident is no joke.
HQ: You'd face legal consequences, right?
GR: That's right.
HQ: Even if it's the pedestrian or cyclist's fault, the driver gets blamed.
GR: That’s what I dislike.
HQ: It does seem unfair.
GR: I think it is unfair.
HQ: Even if someone jumps out suddenly, we'd still be blamed.
GR: Relatives might severely blame you.
HQ: Yes, and witnessing it could lead to PTSD.
GR: It's impressive that people can drive despite these risks.
HQ: They say it becomes second nature with time.
GR: It doesn’t seem like that to me.",1
