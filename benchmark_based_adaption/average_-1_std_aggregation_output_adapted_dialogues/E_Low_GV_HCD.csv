1,"GV: Hello. Do you have any recommended anime or manga?
GL: Hello. I don't read manga often. Do you have any recommendations?
GV: I actually don't watch a lot either. The currently popular ""Spy x Family"" is quite recommended!
GL: Oh, I've seen a little bit of Spy x Family! Is the second season of the anime going to be broadcast?
GV: Yes, the second season is scheduled to air in October.
GL: I see. Oh, I watched a little bit of the anime called Kaguya-sama: Love is War that was on a while ago!
GV: Kaguya-sama is on my watch list!
GL: Really? I think it concluded recently. It had a comedic tone and was easy to watch!
GV: The original manga has also been completed. I want to check out both the manga and the anime.
GL: I wanted to see the original work! Also, another person I talked to recommended Golden Kamuy!
GV: My sister has the Golden Kamuy manga. I'll read the first volume later.
GL: Oh, really! Everyone was just saying it's interesting!
GV: If you like cars, how about Initial D? It's an old work, but interesting.
GL: I watched a bit of the anime Initial D. The characters are unique and interesting.
GV: I like Mazda cars partly because of the influence of Initial D.
GL: I see! If you were to get a license, would it be for manual?
GV: The plan is for an automatic car. I don't think I can drive a manual well.
GL: I have a manual license, but an automatic license is easier to get.
GV: How is it to drive a manual car?
GL: It was difficult to drive while changing gears!
GV: It seems quite difficult until you get used to it. I'll go with an automatic.
GL: It's not as hard to drive as in Initial D!
GV: In reality, there shouldn't be street racing, so as long as it can be used as transportation, it's enough.
GL: That's right. It's convenient!
GV: Once I get my license, I'll practice driving in the nearby mountains. I'm a little worried about getting car sick.
GL: Before I started driving, I used to get car sick, but not while driving.
GV: I've heard that the driver doesn't get car sick.
GL: I'm not very good at driving, but I've never gotten car sick.
GV: I'll do my best at the driving school!
GL: Yes! I wish you the best of luck!",1
2,"GV: Hello. Have you ever donated blood?  
GL: Yes, I have participated in an internship experience related to blood donation.  
GV: Did you actually draw blood during your training?  
GL: No, I volunteered without pay in caregiving, blood donation, and hospital visits based on my medical experience.  
GV: Understood. How was the experience?  
GL: On the last day, I donated blood myself. I felt fine afterward.  
GV: So you donated blood too! I recently did that for the first time.  
GL: It’s surprising to see many volunteers donating blood.  
GV: I also didn’t have any issues like anemia.  
GL: They took 400 mL, but it wasn’t a big deal.  
GV: I discovered my blood type during the donation.  
GL: Blood donation can reveal your blood type and serve as a health check.  
GV: I found the test results quite interesting.  
GL: It’s important to be health-conscious. Regular donations are beneficial.  
GV: I plan to go again in November.  
GL: Blood donation facilities have unique characteristics.  
GV: I donated at a mobile unit. Next time, I want to visit a facility.  
GL: The facility I visited felt like a café.  
GV: That sounds appealing. I’ll look for a good facility.  
GL: Yes, do that.  
GV: What is your blood type?  
GL: I’m type O, which can be given to anyone.  
GV: I’m type O too. I hoped for a rare Rh-negative, but it’s positive.  
GL: Mine is positive as well.  
GV: Do you know anyone with Rh-negative?  
GL: Not really. My training partner couldn’t donate due to anemia.  
GV: Only healthy individuals can donate.  
GL: Yes, those prone to anemia are ineligible.  
GV: Drawing 400 ml makes sense.  
GL: Health is important.",2
3,"GV: Good morning. How can I assist you today?
HA: Good morning! I'm here to help. What can I do for you?
GV: What is your child's grade level?
HA: The older one is in first grade, and the younger one is in preschool.
GV: That must be challenging at times.
HA: Yes, but they are learning many new things.
GV: Are there still difficulties with the younger child?
HA: Yes, there are occasional accidents.
GV: That sounds tough.
HA: Sometimes the mattress is wet in the morning.
GV: Have you tried using a plastic cover under the sheets?
HA: That might help, but my child moves a lot during sleep.
GV: That does seem challenging.
HA: Yes, we would need to cover the entire mattress.
GV: Have you considered using diapers?
HA: Recently, we've started using diapers again at night.
GV: It's okay to let your child transition at their own pace.
HA: Yes, patience is important.
GV: Keep up the good work.
HA: Thank you. Do you have any children?
GV: I am a university student.
HA: Is your university conducting remote classes?
GV: Face-to-face interactions are partially resuming.
HA: Have you attended in person yet?
GV: I did for a while. I've completed my credits and am not taking more lectures.
HA: Are you currently job hunting?
GV: Job hunting is finished. I am a fourth-year university student.
HA: Do you have free time?
GV: Yes, I plan to go to driving school soon.
HA: Good idea. It will be harder once you start working.",5
4,"GV: Good morning. Ready to begin?
HA: Thanks for your cooperation.
GV: Is the PTA difficult to manage?
HA: I haven't been very active. Should I be?
GV: Do current schools still have PTAs?
HA: Yes, it's organized by grades.
GV: I'm not familiar with it.
HA: COVID has reduced the tasks.
GV: That's good news.
HA: Outsourcing would be ideal.
GV: I agree.
HA: Some people can't afford it.
GV: The government should invest more in education.
HA: Especially in research roles.
GV: Job hunting is tougher after a PhD.
HA: Is it because of age?
GV: That's likely. Few places in Japan need a PhD.
HA: Are fewer people pursuing PhDs?
GV: Yes, it seems so.
HA: Are you in sciences or humanities?
GV: Sciences. Many go to grad school.
HA: Does a science degree help with job hunting?
GV: A master's can help for specialized roles.
HA: Are you looking for a job in your field?
GV: It depends. Some fields have fewer jobs.
HA: What’s your major?
GV: Mathematics.
HA: What jobs are available with that?
GV: I got a job mostly unrelated to math.
HA: Understood.",16

HA: There's a good one in Ueno.
GV: I live in Kanagawa, so it's easy to visit.
HA: Which part of Kanagawa?
GV: Atsugi.
HA: It takes over an hour by train, right?
GV: Yes. I'm used to long commutes.
HA: Crowded trains can be stressful.
GV: Yes, but I'm used to it now.
HA: Is your university in Tokyo?
GV: Yes, it is.
HA: Do you use your commuter pass to explore?
GV: Yes, it's convenient.

6,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you.  
HA: Hello. How can I assist you today?  
GV: Have there been any happy events recently?  
HA: I got to know someone through my hobby.  
GV: That sounds nice. What hobby is it?  
HA: I became friends with someone who likes the same commentator as I do.  
GV: Did you become friends on Twitter?  
HA: Yes, we followed each other after chatting.  
GV: Is it like a Vtuber?  
HA: It's a game commentary team.  
GV: Do you mean a team for FPS games?  
HA: No, it's for RPGs.  
GV: I see.  
HA: Yes, there are quite a few people.  
GV: What is the name of the team?  
HA: The men of Naples.  
GV: I'll look it up later.  
HA: It's quite minor.  
GV: That makes it special. I understand.  
HA: Do you connect over shared interests?  
GV: Yes, I often make friends on Twitter.  
HA: What prompted it?  
GV: A hobby. I meet people who play mahjong.  
HA: Do you play with them?  
GV: Yes, sometimes at mahjong parlors.  
HA: What was your impression when you first met them?  
GV: They often seem different in person.  
HA: Do you get to know their personality better?  
GV: Yes, some might be different online.  
HA: That's interesting.",2
7,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you.
HA: Thank you in advance!
GV: Have you tried different methods to get your children to eat vegetables?
HA: I’ve given up. If they don’t eat this, no snacks!
GV: Using food as a reward seems reasonable if they dislike vegetables.
HA: That’s right. Also, I don’t eat meat, so there’s nothing I can eat.
GV: Not eating meat is quite unique.
HA: Something hard doesn’t work.
GV: Many children find raw vegetables difficult. Would cooking them, like stir-frying, help?
HA: Even if I stir-fry them, it’s no use. They won’t eat bean sprouts or cabbage.
GV: Have you considered trying vegetable juice?
HA: I haven’t tried vegetable juice yet. I’ll try it, but if they don’t like it, it will be tough.
GV: I hope it works out.
HA: Do you have any food preferences?
GV: I’ve never had many since childhood.
HA: That must have been easier for your mother.
GV: Yes, my mother mentioned it was easier for her.
HA: Do you eat a lot?
GV: I used to eat more, but now I try to reduce my portions for my diet.
HA: How much did you used to eat?
GV: I could eat around three servings before. Now, I aim for one serving.
HA: Amazing! I had sisters, so your experience is different.
GV: Sports club members eat much more.
HA: Are you careful about anything when you eat now?
GV: I focus on reducing carbohydrates and increasing protein.
HA: What do you eat for protein?
GV: Like the salad chicken I had earlier, I eat lean meat.
HA: So meat is okay on a diet.
GV: Yes, I avoid the fatty parts.
HA: Less fatty meat seems good.",2
8,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you.  
HA: Hello. It's nice to meet you too.  
GV: What field did you major in at university?  
HA: I am a theater major.  
GV: I see! Did you study that field because you liked theater?  
HA: Yes, I enjoy theater. It is part of the Faculty of Letters.  
GV: Did you also enjoy watching various things besides Takarazuka?  
HA: Yes, I often watched dancing.  
GV: What genre is it?  
HA: For example, ballet or contemporary dance. Are you familiar with contemporary dance?  
GV: Yes, I have heard of it.  
HA: It's a style that doesn't appeal to everyone, so it might not be for everyone.  
GV: I remember seeing dancers performing that style at the Kohaku Uta Gassen. I don't mind it!  
HA: Is it similar to Nogizaka48's backup dancers?  
GV: I don't recall which artist it was.  
HA: Understood. Do you also know about Swan Lake?  
GV: I know the piece! Was it originally a ballet work?  
HA: Yes, it was. Did you know there is a male version of Swan Lake?  
GV: I didn't know that.  
HA: The male version features male dancers in the roles of swans, performing duets. This style aligns with current trends.  
GV: If I get the chance, I'd like to see it too. Once I get a job, I might have less time.  
HA: Due to COVID-19, there have been fewer performances in Japan, which is unfortunate.  
GV: Crossing borders is still difficult now, isn't it?  
HA: Yes. But recently, some travel restrictions have been lifted.  
GV: I think I heard similar news.  
HA: It would be great if performances increased in the future.  
GV: The performers must have struggled a lot since the start of COVID.  
HA: Many performances in Japan have been canceled.  
GV: I hope everything gets back to normal soon.  
HA: I agree. The situation has been quite challenging.  ",1
