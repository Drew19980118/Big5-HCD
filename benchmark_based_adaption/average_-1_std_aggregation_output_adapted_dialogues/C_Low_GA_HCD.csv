CB: It's popular. I bought the merchandise.  
GA: It's that big?  
CB: My first grader sleeps with the keychain.  
GA: I looked them up. Different than I expected.  
CB: Only 2 out of 13 show faces.  
GA: Interesting. Do kids often get hooked early?

EO: Yes, I am eating now.  
GA: Me too!  
EO: What are you having?  
GA: Rice with raw egg.  
EO: Simple and nutritious.  
GA: I added olive oil, wasabi, and used noodle soup base instead of soy sauce.  
EO: Unique combination.

EO: Strong flavors. Worth trying.  
GA: Olive oil alone is good! What are you eating?  
EO: Toast, boiled egg, grapes, and pumpkin salad.  
GA: Stylish breakfast.  
EO: Noted.

EO: Yes, it is.  
GA: Seems like a lot of work.  
EO: Not feasible in the morning.  
GA: I don't cook much, so it seems tough.  
EO: Do you cook?  
GA: My mother cooks for me.  
EO: Acknowledged.  
GA: I'm grateful to her.  
EO: Appreciate her.

EO: Good morning.
GA: What are your hobbies?

EO: Novels and books on parenting.
GA: I don't read much.
EO: Everyone has their own preferences.
GA: I prefer watching anime.
EO: What anime do you watch?
GA: Recently, BLEACH.
EO: BLEACH is nostalgic.
GA: It's been around for a while.
EO: I collected the paperback editions.
GA: A generational favorite.
EO: The rescue of Rukia is notable.
GA: I liked the Arrancar arc.
EO: The enemies are interesting.
GA: I quoted BLEACH lines with friends.
EO: Can you elaborate?
GA: Just imitating characters.
EO: Like saying ""Bankai""?
GA: Yes, while gaming.
EO: My children do that too.
GA: I feel childlike.
EO: It's good to stay young at heart.
GA: My friends agree.
EO: Keep that spirit alive.
GA: I will.
EO: Let's do that.",3
4,"GA: Thank you in advance!  
EO: Nice to meet you! I listened to your song!  
GA: Thanks a lot!  
EO: It felt really good. Is this Kansai dialect?  
GA: Yes, it is. I made it with Yashiki Takajin in mind since I'm from Kansai.  
EO: I'm from Kansai too, so it felt familiar.  
GA: That's good to hear. Glad you liked it.  
EO: It's impressive that you made this by yourself. Are you planning to be a composer?  
GA: It would be nice if I could.  
EO: I hope it works out. Do you work on music every day?  
GA: Not consistently, my motivation varies.  
EO: Have you told your parents about your music?  
GA: No, they don’t know about it.  
EO: That's a secret then?  
GA: Yes, I don’t discuss personal things with my parents much.  
EO: I understand.  
GA: I used to share everything when I was little, but not anymore since junior high.  
EO: That sounds lonely. Do you talk to your father?  
GA: I talk to my mom a bit, but rarely to my dad unless necessary.  
EO: Your dad seems stricter.  
GA: He has mellowed out with age.  
EO: Parents do mellow with age.  
GA: It's normal for parents to be strict. Maybe I’m just cautious.  
EO: Is your dad also strict? Mine is.  
GA: He might look a bit scary.  
EO: At our house, if we didn't sit properly during meals, we’d get hit.  
GA: That's intense! My dad once threw a cabbage at me.  
EO: Why a cabbage?  
GA: Probably because it was nearby.  
EO: Amusing.",3
5,"GA: Hello!
EO: Nice to meet you!
GA: Can you tell me about your family memories?
EO: That’s a challenging question.
GA: Sorry for asking that.
EO: Are you referring to your current household, not your birth family?
GA: Yes, exactly. It’s hard to explain briefly.
EO: Understood. It’s quite complex.
GA: Do your children do any extracurricular activities?
EO: I was at an art class, now heading to mini-basketball practice.
GA: That's diverse. Mini-basketball is basketball, right?
EO: Yes, that’s correct.
GA: Are you good at sports?
EO: Not really.
GA: That's unexpected. It seems tough.
EO: I chose it myself and enjoy it.
GA: If they enjoy it, they might become athletic. Is this different from the child in painting class?
EO: The eldest and second son attend art class. Mini basketball is for the eldest son in elementary school.
GA: I see. That’s impressive. I couldn’t stick with lessons.
EO: Did you learn something?
GA: I attended abacus, English, and cram school. Only the English class continued.
EO: Are you good at English?
GA: My pronunciation is decent; everything else isn’t great.
EO: I also disliked studying.
GA: I took English classes because of a friend. I don’t like studying.
EO: That’s an unusual reason.
GA: I couldn't help it; I was interested in my friend.
EO: Understood.
GA: I wish I could speak English fluently.
EO: Didn't that happen?",4
6,"GA: Please!  
EO: Thank you.  
GA: What music do you listen to?  
EO: Anime theme songs.  
GA: Older anime?  
EO: No, like Mixed Nuts and Habit.  
GA: Understood.  
EO: My child watches Spy x Family. I'm rewatching Naruto.  
GA: Rewatching takes time.  
EO: Orochimaru and the Third Hokage are fighting.  
GA: Early in the series.  
EO: I can only watch a bit.  
GA: Noted. 2-3 years without fillers.  
EO: That long?  
GA: Yes, it aired for 15 years.  
EO: Surprising.  
GA: Slow and steady works.  
EO: Agreed. Since when have you been a shut-in?  
GA: Since the COVID-19 emergency.  
EO: Recently?  
GA: I slacked off since junior high, dropped out of high school, and couldn't keep a part-time job.  
EO: Understood.  
GA: Yes.  
EO: I was often late too.  
GA: If late, I didn’t go.  
EO: I was late but went, sometimes at lunch.  
GA: More than five times, had to write reflection papers.  
EO: Understood. They required us to write them.  
GA: Different without that system.  
EO: Indeed.",22
7,"GA: Please!
EO: Nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?
GA: What kind of part-time jobs have you done so far?
EO: Izakaya, convenience store, family restaurant, home tutor, cram school teacher, cabaret club, apparel.
GA: Those are all customer service jobs. It must be tough if you're shy.
EO: Yes, but work tasks make it manageable.
GA: I understand. Sometimes it's easier to talk to strangers.
EO: Yes, customers are different.
GA: When I worked at a call center, my vocabulary and clarity improved.
EO: I have considered working at a call center.
GA: I was surprised by how easy it was. Getting used to the manual took time.
EO: Interesting. It seemed difficult.
GA: It varies. I supported staff, so fewer complaints.
EO: I see. Call centers have different functions.
GA: Yes, exactly.
EO: What other part-time jobs have you done?
GA: Warehouse, stocking shelves, bread factory, game testing.
EO: Those are behind-the-scenes roles.
GA: Yes, mostly back-office jobs. I initially resisted the call center.
EO: That involves talking to people.
GA: I was nervous but adapted within a month.
EO: Did you work there long?
GA: Yes, it was my longest job. I was praised and got along with coworkers.
EO: Why did you quit?
GA: I struggled with self-discipline and punctuality.
EO: That can indicate stress.
GA: I don't feel stressed, but sometimes I can't get going.
EO: Understood.",5
8,"GA: Could you please assist me with this?
EO: Thank you in advance!
GA: Does working at a cram school and tutoring mean you were smart?
EO: I am primarily skilled in Japanese.
GA: Can you work part-time as a teacher specializing in Japanese language?
EO: Yes, it was sufficient to teach only Japanese.
GA: That's surprising! I thought you needed to be good at all subjects.
EO: No, the time for Japanese and math was fixed at cram schools.
GA: It's true; there were teachers who only handled math as well.
EO: Correct. Tutors for elementary school students might teach subjects other than Japanese language arts.
GA: If you can add some exercise to that, it would be great, right?
EO: Unfortunately, exercise isn't included.
GA: Everyone has some limitations... I also wanted to try teaching.
EO: How about becoming an English teacher?
GA: No, I felt too shy to claim I could speak English.
EO: What was your deviation score?
GA: The high school I attended had a ranking around 47.
EO: 47, got it.
GA: It was a relatively average high school, without many delinquents.
EO: My high school was ranked around 55, and I scored about 65 in Japanese.
GA: Scoring around 60 seems ideal. Reaching 65 is impressive!
EO: However, I couldn't reach 70.
GA: People scoring around 70 may lack in other areas; it's best to stay balanced.
EO: Agreed. My older brother is intelligent but has peculiar traits.
GA: That's unexpected.
EO: He researches cancer at ** but has significant personality issues.
GA: Many intelligent people find communication challenging, especially if not among peers.
EO: Compatibility could play a role.
GA: I've heard a large IQ gap can make communication difficult.
EO: Understood.",1
