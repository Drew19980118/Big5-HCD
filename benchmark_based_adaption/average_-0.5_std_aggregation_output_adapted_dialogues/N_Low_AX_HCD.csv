1,"AX: Good evening. Nice to meet you.  
AN: Good evening. Nice to meet you.  

AX: Do you drink alcohol often?  
AN: Yes, I do. How about you?  

AX: Occasionally. I discovered an interesting bar recently.  
AN: What kind of bar is it?  

AX: The clientele was unique.  
AN: Who were the customers?  

AX: Mostly people in their 70s or older.  
AN: An elderly crowd!  

AX: Both men and women with fascinating conversations.  
AN: What were they discussing?  

AX: One mentioned falling and needing seven stitches.  
AN: A serious injury!  

AX: The entrance wasn't high, so I was surprised.  
AN: Safe for them to be drinking? Was it a man or a woman?  

AX: A grandmother.  
AN: She should rest at home!  

AX: The bar is in Higashi-Mikuni, and the bartender is a woman in her 40s.  
AN: Higashi-Mikuni has many interesting places.  

AX: Yes, on my way back from work. The bartender seemed younger compared to the clientele.  
AN: Surrounded by 70-year-olds, someone in their 40s would appear young.  

AX: It didn't feel lively to me.  
AN: Too subdued?  

AX: For a moment, yes. I was careful when leaving.  
AN: Injuries can be serious.  

AX: We're becoming part of the older generation.  
AN: My husband broke his front tooth when drunk once.  

AX: That's dangerous. Be careful.  
AN: Yes, let's stay cautious.",2
2,"AX: Thank you for your hard work. I look forward to working with you.
AN: Thank you for your hard work today. Please take care of it!
AX: What kind of alcohol do you like?
AN: Beer and wine.
AX: I enjoy standing wine bars.
AN: I haven't been drinking outside lately.
AX: I haven't been able to go much since coming to Osaka. Maybe only twice to a unique bar.
AN: Do you often encounter unique bars?
AX: No, I went back to check it out.
AN: An unexpected second visit!
AX: It bothered me, so I went again.
AN: Was it interesting the second time?
AX: The customers didn't change. It's that kind of place.
AN: It must be a bar for regulars.
AX: It felt odd since it was my first bar in Osaka for a while.
AN: There are many better bars. Don't be discouraged!
AX: Is that so? It still feels unreal.
AN: Osaka has good places, and Kyoto has wonderful bars.
AX: Kyoto has a great atmosphere, doesn't it?
AN: Yes, many bars with a great atmosphere. A bar with a wide selection of whiskey was the best.
AX: It sounds authentic. I'd like to visit.
AN: Please do if you get the chance.
AX: Sure, I'll try exploring. I haven't been to Kyoto much.
AN: COVID-19 made going out difficult, right?
AX: Yes. Most shops were closed in the first year.
AN: Almost all the stores were closed.
AX: Yeah. Recently, I felt like going, but with cases rising, it's tricky.
AN: It felt like just when business hours normalized, didn't it?
AX: That's right. Drinking at home is more common.
AN: Same here. I hope daily life returns soon.",3
3,"AX: Good evening. Thanks in advance.
BG: Good evening. Equipment from Kamakura Seisakusho is expensive.
AX: It looks heavy to carry.
BG: Carrying it on your back would be exhausting.
AX: True. Can I switch topics?
BG: Sure, go ahead.
AX: Have you had any recent interviews or meetings with staff?
BG: Not recently. I have memories from the past.
AX: I interviewed someone who made me laugh.
BG: What happened?
AX: I asked a 27-year-old woman about her most enjoyable job.
BG: Your older brother was the interviewer?
AX: Yes, I attended just in case. Do you know her answer?
BG: What was it?
AX: She said being a shrine maiden.
BG: Unexpected.
AX: Yes, then something strange happened.
BG: What happened?
AX: Her face was covered in snot, dripping to her mouth.
BG: Why?
AX: I don't know. I couldn't ask or look at her face.
BG: Did she notice?
AX: Not sure. I asked what job she'd like next. She said shrine maiden again.
BG: Why apply to your brother's company?
AX: Shrine maidens retire at 26.
BG: So she can't be a shrine maiden anymore. Was she hired?
AX: I declined her. We hired someone else. Informed the sales department.
BG: Understood. Thank you for sharing.",7
4,"AX: Good evening.  
BG: Good evening. Any fears you'd like to share?  
AX: I've been careful with my words recently.  
BG: I was thinking more about ghost stories, especially since it's summer.  
AX: Oh, like that? Are you scared of those?  
BG: Not really. Your language is fine. I should be careful too.  
AX: When I lived in Hakodate, people were influenced by parents from Aomori.  
BG: Is it religious?  
AX: No, it was a job called Itako. Are you concerned?  
BG: Itako? Sounds frightening.  
AX: It's better not to be too scared. Curiosity can be harmful.  
BG: I'm not curious. It's the darkness after such stories that scares me.  
AX: It is unpleasant. People in such jobs can be scary.  
BG: I've never met such a person. Were you okay?  
AX: Yes. Some people saw things and were scared, and a son was hospitalized.  
BG: That seems like an unusual fear. It's unknown to me too.  
AX: You can prevent it by being mindful of what you see and hear daily.  
BG: What do you mean?  
AX: Watching news daily can make you feel down, right?  
BG: Yes.  
AX: Constant news about rising prices can be depressing.  
BG: I stopped watching the news because it made me anxious.  
AX: It's important to be cautious about what we incorporate into our daily lives.  
BG: Thanks for explaining.  
AX: No problem. Information keeps coming in like push notifications nowadays.  
BG: True. There's so much I don't want to see that I've come to dislike TV.  
AX: Me too. Previously, I could choose books myself. I'm worried about the kids too.  
BG: The online world can be overwhelming. We need a good balance.  
AX: Exactly. Staring at screens can be tiring for the eyes.  
BG: I agree. Hazuki Loupe helps with that.",8
5,"AX: Good evening. I look forward to working with you.
BG: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
AX: Have we discussed AI before?
BG: We haven't covered that topic.
AX: Do you use AI often?
BG: Not frequently.
AX: During the COVID-19 pandemic, chatbots began using AI more extensively.
BG: I've used AI-based inquiry desks.
AX: Yes, many websites now ask, ""Do you need any help?"" automatically.
BG: It's useful to open them, despite the occasional annoyance.
AX: They've improved their language processing significantly.
BG: But they're still not very helpful in tough situations.
AX: That might be due to basic versions being used.
BG: High-quality ones are often from reputable companies.
AX: Most advanced systems use IBM's Watson.
BG: Watson is a reliable choice.
AX: In Japan, Pepper robots utilize Watson's AI.
BG: I have seen Pepper in some restaurants.
AX: The robot's exterior is just a shell; inside, it runs on Watson.
BG: Implementing such technology is expensive.
AX: Proper implementation costs millions.
BG: That's a significant investment.
AX: They enhance accuracy through extensive trials and learning processes.
BG: So, it improves over time.
AX: Yes, much like how humans learn contextually.
BG: Understood.
AX: AI differentiates similar words based on context through deep learning.
BG: That's quite advanced.
AX: It analyzes vast data sets to make accurate judgments.
BG: AI is indeed a fascinating field.",3
6,"AX: Good evening. I look forward to working with you today.
AG: Good evening! Likewise, I look forward to working with you.
AX: Speaking of summer, many people prefer to have cold things; how about you?
AG: I've heard that cold things can harm your body, so I try to avoid them as much as possible.
AX: Are there many warm things you prefer?
AG: I usually drink soup or room-temperature tea.
AX: I see. So does that mean it doesn't really matter whether it's summer or winter?
AG: Yes, indeed. How about you?
AX: In the summer, I can have cold things and in the winter, I have warm things.
AG: Do you also eat ice cream?
AX: Yes, I will eat ice cream too. Can't you eat ice cream?
AG: No, even though I try to cut back on cold things, I still end up wanting to eat ice cream. It's delicious, isn't it?
AX: That's right. Speaking of which, the AI Expo is currently being held in the area where I live.
AG: Does ""Ice Expo"" mean it's an event where various kinds of ice cream are gathered?
AX: That's right. It seems they have gathered from all over Japan, and it's the first time in three years.
AG: Amazing! From all over Japan!? Are you going there?
AX: Actually, I went there today.
AG: Oh! How timely! How was it?
AX: There were things like freshly baked waffle cones with buns and soft serve on top.
AG: That sounds luxurious! But you can't really walk around eating ice cream that much, right?
AX: I could only eat one. But there were various other things too.
AG: When there are so many delicious-looking options, it's hard to narrow it down to just one!
AX: That's right. In Yamanashi, they had various fruit sherbet ice creams.
AG: Yamanashi has delicious fruits like grapes, pears, and peaches. Just imagining them makes my mouth water!
AX: There was also one covered entirely with mandarin oranges and had whipped ice cream inside.
AG: That sounds like an unusual and rare ice cream!
AX: That's true. There was also something called macaron ice, and women were lining up in long queues for it.
AG: Indeed. It's an ice cream that women are likely to like. I wonder if they will eventually sell it at convenience stores?
AX: It's convenient to buy things at a convenience store, isn't it?
AG: Yes, I hope they will!",1
7,"AX: Good evening. Thank you in advance.
AG: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
AX: Do you prefer hot drinks?
AG: I prefer warm drinks. And you?
AX: Either is fine. Do you drink coffee?
AG: Yes, 1 or 2 cups a day.
AX: I recently listened to the CEO of Starbucks Japan.
AG: Interesting. What did you learn?
AX: He mentioned that the coffee at 7-Eleven is delicious.
AG: That's quite an endorsement.
AX: Empathy among staff is an individual effort.
AG: Did you find that information useful?
AX: For example, a clerk might offer coffee if someone nearby had an accident.
AG: They give a free drink by their own choice.
AX: Yes, the clerks do it voluntarily.
AG: Would you offer the coffee in that situation?
AX: They approached the person, but it's uncertain if they made the coffee. They seemed very empathetic.
AG: I would offer it, regardless of policy.
AX: That's suitable for Starbucks.
AG: Understood.
AX: A while ago, I was impressed at Starbucks.
AG: What impressed you?
AX: A young girl, probably deaf, could only communicate in writing and was a store clerk.
AG: That's remarkable.
AX: She used a menu with illustrations for communication.
AG: That's innovative.
AX: Other clerks helped only when needed; otherwise, she managed on her own.
AG: More comfortable for her.
AX: As a customer, I felt grateful.
AG: Customers and staff being considerate creates a good atmosphere.",5
8,"AX: Good evening. I'm excited to work with you.  
AG: Good evening! Looking forward to assisting you.  
AX: Have you ever tried shaved ice during summer?  
AG: Yes, recently.  
AX: Did you eat it already?  
AG: Yes, it used famous well water.  
AX: What kind was it?  
AG: Clear ice, homemade syrup.  
AX: From a cake shop? Interesting. There's a shaved ice shop nearby.  
AG: Have you been there?  
AX: Not yet. It's from a dumpling shop.  
AG: A dumpling shop? Interesting.  
AX: Shaved ice now often has various toppings.  
AG: Yes, for visual appeal.  
AX: They use three-colored dumplings.  
AG: Three-color dango, fitting for a dango shop.  
AX: It's intriguing.  
AG: Looks like chilled zenzai. Is it shiratama?  
AX: I like white dumplings but can't decide with the three colors.  
AG: Texture closer to a dumpling. Any red bean paste?  
AX: Didn't seem to have any. There are also fluffy and creamy types.  
AG: Yes, from Taiwanese shaved ice trends.  
AX: Have you tried Taiwanese shaved ice?  
AG: Saw it on TV, haven't tried. Mango flavor looks delicious.  
AX: The visuals are striking.  
AG: Flavoring the ice is surprising.  
AX: So, they flavor the ice? Hadn't thought of that.  
AG: Yes, it keeps the ice fluffy. I'd like to try it.  
AX: I understand now. Thanks for explaining.  
AG: You're welcome! Hope we both get to try it someday!",5
