1,"GV: Hello. Do you have any recommended anime or manga?  
GL: Hello. Do you have any recommendations?  
GV: I actually don't watch a lot either. The currently popular ""Spy x Family"" is quite recommended!  
GL: Oh, I've seen a little bit of Spy x Family! Is the second season of the anime going to be broadcast?  
GV: Yes, the second season is scheduled to air in October.  
GL: I see. Oh, I watched a little bit of the anime called Kaguya-sama: Love is War that was on a while ago!  
GV: I want to watch Kaguya-sama someday.  
GL: Really? I think it concluded recently. It had a comedic tone and was easy to watch!  
GV: The original manga has also been completed. I want to watch both the manga and the anime.  
GL: I wanted to see the original work! Also, another person I talked to recommended Golden Kamuy!  
GV: My sister has the Golden Kamuy manga. I'll read a little of the first volume later.  
GL: Oh, really! Everyone says it's interesting! Definitely!  
GV: If you like cars, how about Initial D? It's an old work, but interesting.  
GL: I watched a bit of Initial D. The characters are unique and it's quite interesting, isn't it?  
GV: I like Mazda cars partly because of Initial D!  
GL: I see! If you were to get a license, would it be for manual?  
GV: The plan is for an automatic car. Manuals are cool, but I have no confidence that I can drive one well.  
GL: I have a manual license, but an automatic license is easier to get!  
GV: How is it actually to drive a manual car?  
GL: I thought it was difficult to drive while changing gears! If you like it, I recommend it.  
GV: It seems difficult until you get used to it. I'll be satisfied with an automatic.  
GL: It's not as hard to drive as in Initial D! You can drive an automatic smoothly!  
GV: In the real world, street racing is not needed. It's enough if the car can be used for transportation.  
GL: That's right. It's usually convenient! But driving on mountain roads can be fun.  
GV: Once I get my license, I plan to practice driving in the nearby mountains. I'm a bit worried about getting car sick.  
GL: Before I started driving, I got pretty bad car sickness, but I don't get as car sick while driving.  
GV: The driver himself doesn't get that drunk.  
GL: Yes, I'm not very good at driving either, but I've never gotten car sick, so that's not a problem!  
GV: I see! I'll do my best at the driving school!  
GL: Yes! Best of luck!",2
2,"GV: Hello. Have you ever donated blood?  
GL: Yes, during an internship.  
GV: Did you draw blood?  
GL: No, I did caregiving and hospital visits.  
GV: How was the experience?  
GL: I donated blood on the last day and felt fine.  
GV: I donated recently too.  
GL: Many people volunteer to donate blood.  
GV: I didn't experience any anemia.  
GL: 400 mL is manageable.  
GV: I found out my blood type.  
GL: It also works as a blood test.  
GV: The test results were interesting.  
GL: Health awareness is important.  
GV: I'll go again in November.  
GL: Facilities vary.  
GV: I donated at a blood donation car. Next, a facility.  
GL: The facility I visited felt like a café.  
GV: I'll find a good facility.  
GL: You should.  
GV: What's your blood type?  
GL: Type O.  
GV: I'm type O too. Rh positive.  
GL: Mine is positive as well.  
GV: Know any Rh negative people?  
GL: No, but a partner couldn't donate due to anemia.  
GV: Only healthy people can donate.  
GL: Yes, anemia-prone people cannot donate.  
GV: Drawing 400ml requires good health.  
GL: Health is crucial.",26
3,"GV: Good morning. I look forward to working with you.  
HA: Good morning! How can I assist you today?  
GV: What is your child's grade level approximately?  
HA: The older one is in first grade, and the younger one is in preschool.  
GV: Understood. That must be challenging.  
HA: Yes, but they can do a lot more when they become elementary school students.  
GV: Are you still having a hard time with the younger child?  
HA: Yes, occasional accidents still happen.  
GV: Dealing with accidents sounds tough.  
HA: Sometimes, the mattress is soaking wet in the morning.  
GV: Laying a plastic bag under the sheets might help.  
HA: That sounds helpful! But my sleeping posture is unpredictable.  
GV: That does sound challenging.  
HA: Yes, so we have to cover the entire surface.  
GV: Do you use diapers?  
HA: Recently, we have started using diapers at night again.  
GV: It’s fine to let your child graduate from diapers at their own pace.  
HA: I agree. I need to be more patient.  
GV: Please keep doing your best!  
HA: Thank you! Do you have any children?  
GV: No, I am a university student.  
HA: Understood! Is your university still remote?  
GV: Some face-to-face interactions are resuming.  
HA: Have you attended any in-person classes?  
GV: I attended a few. Now that I’ve completed my credits, I’m not taking more lectures.  
HA: Are you currently job hunting?  
GV: Job hunting is already finished. I’m a fourth-year university student.  
HA: So do you have free time?  
GV: I have plenty of time. I am planning to go to driving school eventually.  
HA: That's a good idea! It will be harder to find time once you start working.",4
4,"GV: Good morning. I look forward to working with you.

HA: Thank you for your cooperation today! 

GV: Is the PTA tough? 

HA: I'm not sure if I should be doing something specific. 

GV: Is there no PTA in the current elementary schools? 

HA: It seems there is one, but it might be organized by grade level like a duty roster.

GV: I don't really understand it very well. 

HA: Due to COVID, the workload has significantly decreased.

GV: That is quite a relief. I remember my mother used to complain about it a lot in the past.

HA: Yes, times have changed. Outsourcing tasks seems like a good idea.

GV: I truly think that is the case.

HA: Some people might not be able to afford it, which could be why it ends up this way.

GV: I think the government should spend more money on education.

HA: Especially with research positions, more support would be beneficial.

GV: I've often heard that job hunting after getting a PhD is quite challenging. It's unfortunate.

HA: Is it because of age disadvantage?

GV: That might be the case. There seem to be few environments in Japan where one can fully utilize a PhD.

HA: Does that mean fewer people pursue doctoral programs?

GV: It seems to be few.

HA: That makes sense. Are you in the sciences or the humanities?

GV: I'm a science major! There are quite a lot of people going to graduate school.

HA: Does having a science degree make it easier to find a job? What about graduate school?

GV: There's not a significant difference, but having a master's degree might be advantageous for specialized roles.

HA: Are you looking for a job in your field of study?

GV: It depends on the field. For niche areas, you might need to consider other aspects.

HA: There seem to be fewer jobs in some fields. What is your major?

GV: I am majoring in mathematics.

HA: Mathematics! What kind of job can you get with it?

GV: I got a job at a company that's mostly unrelated to mathematics.

HA: It's unfortunate that it turned out that way.",1
5,"GV: Good morning. Thank you in advance.
HA: You're welcome! How can I assist you today?
GV: Do you have any hobbies you've been into recently?
HA: I've always liked watching stage performances.
GV: Do you watch Takarazuka or something like that?
HA: I used to watch Takarazuka a lot.
GV: Did you not only watch the video, but also actually go to the theater?
HA: Yes, I often went to the Takarazuka Grand Theater in Tokyo.
GV: Personally, I don't understand it at all, but I would like to go someday.
HA: Is that so? Do you not watch plays very often?
GV: As far as I remember, I don't have any such experiences.
HA: I see, are you not very interested in art appreciation?
GV: I don't really do that much. Since I have a lot of free time now, I'd like to visit a museum sometime.
HA: Museums are interesting. If you live near Tokyo, there's a wonderful one in Ueno.
GV: Since I live in Kanagawa, it's relatively easy for me to visit Ueno.
HA: That's nice! Which part of Kanagawa do you live in?
GV: I live in Atsugi.
HA: A friend lived in Atsugi. It takes more than an hour by train, right?
GV: That's right. However, since my commute to university is long, I'm used to spending long hours on the train.
HA: College students around the Kanto area are like that. But it seems like the crowded trains would be really stressful.
GV: There is a little stress. I've gotten used to it recently.
HA: I see. Is your university in Tokyo?
GV: Yes! I am attending a university in Tokyo.
HA: So do you sometimes get off somewhere with your commuter pass and go out to have fun?
GV: That's right! It's convenient because you can go to quite a few places just with a commuter pass.
HA: That makes sense. For example, what kind of city do you visit?
GV: Like Machida, for example.
HA: Machida? Shopping?
GV: I often play at the game center with my friends.
HA: Game centers still exist even now!",1
6,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you.  
HA: Ready to start?  
GV: Any happy events lately?  
HA: Met someone via a hobby.  
GV: What hobby?  
HA: Follow a commentator, met another fan.  
GV: On Twitter?  
HA: Yes, we follow each other.  
GV: Vtuber?  
HA: No, game commentary team.  
GV: FPS team?  
HA: No, RPG commentary.  
GV: Understood.  
HA: We're a group of four.  
GV: Team's name?  
HA: The men of Naples.  
GV: I'll look it up.  
HA: It's niche, finding friends was special.  
GV: I get it.  
HA: Connect through hobbies too?  
GV: Yes, on Twitter.  
HA: Your hobby?  
GV: Mahjong, meet players.  
HA: Play with them?  
GV: Yes, at parlors.  
HA: First impression?  
GV: They differ from online personas.  
HA: Explain.  
GV: Some seem unfriendly online but are nice in person.  
HA: Noted.",9
7,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you.  
HA: Thank you in advance!  
GV: Have you done anything to get your children to eat vegetables?  
HA: I've already tried using snacks as incentives.  
GV: That must be challenging. Do they respond to the snacks?  
HA: That's right. Also, I don't eat meat, so there's nothing I can eat.  
GV: Understood. It must be quite an adjustment to not eat meat.  
HA: Hard textures seem to be an issue.  
GV: Many children find raw vegetables difficult. What about cooked ones, like stir-fried vegetables?  
HA: Even if I stir-fry them, it's no use. I absolutely won't eat things like bean sprouts or cabbage.  
GV: Have you tried vegetable juice as an alternative?  
HA: I haven't tried vegetable juice yet. I'll give it a shot!  
GV: I hope it goes well for you.  
HA: Thank you! Do you have any likes or dislikes?  
GV: I don't have many since childhood!  
HA: That must have made things easier for your mother.  
GV: She did mention that it made things easier.  
HA: Do you eat a lot?  
GV: I used to eat more, but now I'm trying to eat less for my diet.  
HA: How much could you eat with a bowl back in the day?  
GV: I could eat about three servings before. Now, I try to stick to one serving.  
HA: Interesting. Do you monitor anything specific when you eat now?  
GV: I'm reducing carbohydrates and increasing protein.  
HA: When you say protein, what are you eating?  
GV: Like the salad chicken from breakfast earlier, I am eating more meat.  
HA: So meat is okay even on a diet.  
GV: Yes, but I avoid the fatty parts.  
HA: Meat with less fat would be good.",2
8,"GV: Hello.
HA: Hello. How can I assist you today?
GV: What did you major in at university?
HA: I majored in theater.
GV: Was it because you liked theater?
HA: Yes, I studied it in the Faculty of Letters.
GV: Did you enjoy watching other performances besides Takarazuka?
HA: Yes, I often watched dance performances.
GV: What kind of dance?
HA: Ballet and contemporary dance. Are you familiar with contemporary dance?
GV: I've heard of it.
HA: It's not for everyone, so it might not be easy to recommend.
GV: I saw something similar at Kohaku Uta Gassen. I don't mind it.
HA: Was it like Nogizaka48 with backup dancers?
GV: I don't remember the artist.
HA: Understood. Are you familiar with Swan Lake?
GV: Yes, I know it. Was it originally a ballet?
HA: Yes, it was. Did you know there's also a male version?
GV: I didn't know that.
HA: In that version, men perform as the swans and dance duets. It's a recent trend.
GV: I’d like to see it if I can. Once I start working, I won’t have much time.
HA: Due to COVID-19, there have been fewer performances in Japan.
GV: Is crossing borders still difficult?
HA: Yes, but some inspections were recently lifted.
GV: I've heard that too.
HA: Hopefully, more events will take place soon.
GV: Performers must have had a tough time since COVID started.
HA: Many performances in Japan were canceled.
GV: I hope things get back to normal soon.
HA: It is difficult but necessary to wait.",3
