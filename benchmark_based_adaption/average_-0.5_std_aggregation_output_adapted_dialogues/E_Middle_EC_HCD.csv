1,"EC: Hello  
DG: Hello!  
EC: Cooking every day has become a hassle lately. Can you recommend any easy and frequently made dishes?  
DG: Recently, I've been enjoying somen with various toppings.  
EC: What kind of toppings can you use for somen?  
DG: Minced meat miso for a tantanmen style or tomatoes for an Italian twist.  
EC: Do you put meat miso and tantanmen directly on the somen noodles?  
DG: Yes, you can prepare it in advance and add it, or use store-bought for convenience.  
EC: That sounds great! Changing the flavor will help keep somen noodles interesting.  
DG: I also tried a chijimi recipe from COOKPAD.  
EC: Do you mix it with flour and bake it?  
DG: I chopped boiled somen and added potato starch for a chewy texture.  
EC: Chewy sounds nice! I want to try it.  
DG: Adding leftover green onions made it better too.  
EC: Green onions are perfect! I've decided on tomorrow's dinner menu. Thanks.  
DG: You're welcome. COOKPAD is very convenient.  
EC: Do you ever get a miss with COOKPAD recipes?  
DG: Yes, sometimes. I don't always follow the measurements.  
EC: I think you have a good eye for it. I often pick the wrong recipe and struggle.  
DG: I see. Have you had any notable failures?  
EC: My biggest failure was a rice cooker cake with canned peaches that turned out mushy.  
DG: That sounds unfortunate.  
EC: Yes, it was quite shocking.  
DG: I've never made a rice cooker cake. It must be disappointing when it doesn't turn out as expected.  
EC: The expectation of enjoying a cake makes it more disappointing when it doesn't work out.  
DG: Definitely. With a rice cooker, you can't check the progress midway, right?  
EC: Also, the cheesecake made with pizza cheese had a disappointing taste.  
DG: You make a lot of sweets. They sound wonderful!  
EC: Thank you. I'll avoid likely failures and focus on success.  
DG: That's a good approach. Sometimes it's better to play it safe.",2
2,"EC: Hello!  
DG: Hello! How can I assist you today?  
EC: Do you have any siblings?  
DG: I am an only child. It can feel a bit lonely at times.  
EC: I see. When I was little, I admired being an only child.  
DG: How many siblings do you have?  
EC: I have one younger sister. We used to fight a lot when we were little, but now we get along well.  
DG: That sounds nice. Being alone as an adult can be lonely.  
EC: If you were to have siblings, would you have preferred a sister? My younger sister wanted a handsome older brother.  
DG: You might feel jealous of your brother's partner.  
EC: Ah, indeed. You might feel jealous of your brother's lover.  
DG: My friend finds it troublesome how close they are with their single brother.  
EC: Sometimes being too close can be a problem. Indeed, if siblings are too close, it might feel like you don't need a romantic partner.  
DG: They spend time together, which makes them feel understood by each other, but it also causes concern.  
EC: I understand your feelings of concern!  
DG: Do you meet your younger sister frequently?  
EC: It's about three hours by bullet train, so we can't meet often. But we do communicate through LINE.  
DG: I see, you are far apart. But it's fun to talk about various things!  
EC: Yes, it's fun! Our family has a daughter and a son, but it's a mystery what kind of relationship they'll have when they grow up.  
DG: It's good to have a harmonious relationship, especially since many young people today seem less interested in marriage.  
EC: Yes, I want them to get along, but when I see them fighting, it seems like they might sever ties in the future.  
DG: My friend used to get into fistfights with their sibling when they were little, but their relationship improved over time.  
EC: It's surprising. I thought it was a big brother who took good care of his little sister and a little sister who loved her big brother since they were young.  
DG: It can be surprising. People change as they grow.  
EC: That's really amazing. People change as they grow.  
DG: If I were to have children, I think having two would be ideal.  
EC: I see! If you have the means and stamina, having five would be lively.  
DG: The cost of dining and outings would be something to consider.  
EC: Dreams are expanding! Thank you very much!  
DG: You're welcome!",2
3,"EC: Hello! Nice to meet you.  
AF: Hello, how can I help you today?  
EC: I accidentally hit my car while parking, and now I feel down.  
AF: I’m sorry to hear that. What kind of damage did it cause?  
EC: The car was already used, but I'm worried about the repair costs.  
AF: Is the damage extensive?  
EC: Not very big, but the parts are misaligned.  
AF: Are you concerned they might fall off?  
EC: Yes, that’s a worry.  
AF: Have you had similar incidents before?  
EC: Did you get scolded when it happened with your parent's car?  
AF: They found out I caused the accident despite my excuse.  
EC: That’s clever. Did they believe your excuse?  
AF: No, they suspected me because I was a beginner.  
EC: Parental intuition is amazing.  
AF: Yes, especially when the damage was significant like the door mirror hanging down.  
EC: If it were a new car, I’d probably turn pale.  
AF: I was quite nervous when it happened.  
EC: Your parents must have been stressed too.  
AF: Do you have any plans for a drive?  
EC: No, I don’t. Do you?  
AF: I’m planning a trip during the summer vacation.  
EC: Sounds great! I’m jealous.  
AF: I usually explore local restaurants.  
EC: That sounds like a lot of fun.  
AF: Saving on hotel costs and enjoying local food is the best.  
EC: I agree! Thanks for today.  
AF: You’re welcome!",2
4,"EC: Hello, thank you for your time today.  
AF: Thank you.  
EC: ""Corona is scary, isn't it?""  
AF: It’s tough to wear a mask because it's hot.  
EC: True, it's challenging with the heat.  
AF: I get mild heatstroke every year, so I'm worried about wearing a mask.  
EC: That’s understandable.  
AF: Have you noticed fewer people wearing masks outdoors?  
EC: In rural areas, many still wear masks due to COVID-19 concerns.  
AF: In the countryside, fewer elderly people wear masks now.  
EC: Interesting, there's a gradual change.  
AF: I stopped wearing a mask outdoors and feel less watched.  
EC: That’s good, reducing heatstroke risk.  
AF: It's too hot this year, so I bought a parasol for children.  
EC: Do classmates use parasols too?  
AF: Some of them do.  
EC: Commuting in this heat must be tough.  
AF: In the morning it's fine, but I use a parasol in the afternoon.  
EC: Afternoon heat is intense.  
AF: Children's parasols are light; I recommend them.  
EC: I’ll check them out.  
AF: They’re less than 2,000 yen.  
EC: That’s reasonable. Are you doing anything else for heatstroke?  
AF: I wear a cooling towel around my neck.  
EC: Does it stay comfortable?  
AF: Wet it, wring it out, dries quickly in summer.  
EC: Sounds practical.  
AF: It's good for adults too, like during housework.  
EC: Thank you, I’ve learned a lot.  
AF: You’re welcome.",3
5,"EC: Hello, nice to meet you!
AF: Hello.

EC: I've been thinking about cleaning up the house but can't get started.
AF: What areas are you looking to clean?

EC: There are toys and children's clothes that are no longer used. They hold memories, so it's hard to throw them away.
AF: I understand. I've kept some of my baby's shoes and clothes from when they were little.

EC: Do you regret throwing away anything?
AF: Yes, but I took a photo before disposing of it.

EC: Photos are a good idea. That way, it’s easier to remember.
AF: When bringing home works or other items, I have them hold it and take a photo.

EC: That's smart. Do you also take photos of crafts before disposing of them?
AF: Yes, I have an album for those, so you can look through it anytime.

EC: Creating an album is great! I've thought about it but haven’t done it yet.
AF: Don’t let them accumulate. I order prints online the same day or the next.

EC: Impressive. Do you order immediately and put it away when it arrives?
AF: Yes, then I give the artwork to the child and dispose of it when it breaks.

EC: That’s helpful. Have you faced any issues for throwing things away secretly?
AF: Surprisingly, they only care about creating it.

EC: Indeed, the fun is in finishing the craft.
AF: Exactly. Sometimes making it is the only fun part.

EC: Especially with things like paper clay. I thought about taking a photo and quietly throwing it away.
AF: I recommend it; it keeps your home tidy.

EC: Maintaining a comfortable home is important. Rooms like the children's room are so messy it’s disheartening.
AF: I give them a garbage bag and ask them to throw away what they don’t need.

EC: Amazing that they throw things away! At our house, everything has memories, so it never ends.
AF: I throw things away often, so my child might have picked that up from me.

EC: Tidying up seems to resemble one’s parents. My parents also keep everything, and so do I.
AF: My mother was also the type to throw things away!

EC: Incredible! Thank you for sharing such valuable insights.
AF: The pleasure was mine.",2
6,"EC: Hello, nice to meet you.
AF: Hello, how can I assist you today?
EC: I'm considering buying a new computer. Can you tell me about your computer's specs?
AF: The operating system is the latest Windows.
EC: I often end up with devices that freeze or are slow to update. It's frustrating.
AF: You might want to look at cost-effective used computers.
EC: How do you choose a second-hand computer?
AF: Prices are checked on Rakuten.
EC: Your husband must be knowledgeable about computers.
AF: Yes, he confirms the choice.
EC: I have to choose myself since I use it often.
AF: Consulting with a store could help you decide.
EC: That makes sense. Consulting with the store could reduce mistakes.
AF: Smartphones are high-spec nowadays, which can be confusing.
EC: There are so many options. I'm interested in trying Google Pixel.
AF: I recently replaced my smartphone.
EC: What kind did you get?
AF: The latest 5G from Tone Mobile.
EC: I hear a lot about 5G, but it's hard to get excited about it.
AF: It mainly offers smoother performance.
EC: With 5G, you'd expect more speed, right?
AF: Is 5G related to speed?
EC: I thought it was, but I'm not sure either.
AF: Modern smartphone cameras take good pictures.
EC: Yes, though my smartphone's zoom is disappointing.
AF: For serious photography, use a digital single-lens reflex camera.
EC: It makes sense to use each device properly.
AF: I have trouble keeping up with new technology.
EC: Same here. Thank you very much!
AF: You are welcome. Thank you very much!",5
7,"EC: Hello!  
AF: Hello, how can I assist you today?  
EC: Have you been watching any TV shows or anime recently?  
AF: Yes, I am currently watching Naruto and Bleach.  
EC: Both are great! I want to watch them too.  
AF: Both have long-running anime adaptations.  
EC: Both have ended in the manga, but is the anime still ongoing?  
AF: The Naruto anime is complete.  
EC: I see. Now I want to watch it.  
AF: The main character, Naruto, grows significantly throughout the series.  
EC: I see, that's interesting!  
AF: Watching Naruto's development is quite a journey.  
EC: Naruto has a sequel, right?  
AF: Yes, 'Boruto: Naruto Next Generations'.  
EC: I might enjoy it from a different perspective!  
AF: Naruto's marriage partner was surprising.  
EC: I still don't know who it is!  
AF: I'll keep that a secret. I have just started watching Bleach recently.  
EC: Bankai is cool, isn't it?  
AF: Yes, Bleach has unique character designs.  
EC: I don't know Jujutsu Kaisen, but Bleach is interesting because all the characters stand out.  
AF: Bleach quickly hooked me, and I want to watch the movies too.  
EC: There's a movie too? I didn't know that.  
AF: Yes, it's available on Netflix.  
EC: I don't have Netflix. I will watch it someday. Thank you.  
AF: You're welcome.",4
8,"EC: Good evening!
AF: Good evening. How can I assist you?
EC: Do you clean your air conditioner annually? It seems costly.
AF: I clean it every three years.
EC: The company recommended yearly cleaning. I was unsure.
AF: You might need to replace it soon.
EC: Air conditioners are expensive.
AF: Using a store-bought spray can be a cheaper alternative.
EC: Are those sprays effective?
AF: I haven't used them. They might cause damage.
EC: That makes sense.
AF: I prefer to handle the maintenance myself.
EC: It’s a good way to save money.
AF: Self-maintenance reduces costs.
EC: Are you good at saving money?
AF: I focus on investing.
EC: Do you use NISA or something similar?
AF: Yes, I use NISA and iDeCo within my limits.
EC: How did you learn about investing?
AF: Through books and experience.
EC: Aren't you worried about losses?
AF: Losses are a part of it, similar to shopping mistakes.
EC: That’s reassuring.
AF: I keep my losses manageable.
EC: Keeping investments within acceptable loss limits is wise.
AF: Yes, though I'm not great at regular shopping.
EC: I'm interested in investing now.
AF: Consider Rakuten Points for a low-risk start.
EC: I’ll check it out. Thanks.
AF: You're welcome.",6
