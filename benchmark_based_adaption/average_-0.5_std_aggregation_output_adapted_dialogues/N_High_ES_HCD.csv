AR: Hello, nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?
ES: I’m feeling a bit nervous.
AR: Do you often feel shy around new people?
ES: Yes, I do.
AR: I understand. I also tend to feel nervous in new situations, especially during presentations.
ES: That sounds similar to me! Are you talking about presentations?
AR: Yes. I used to write the character for 'people' (人) three times on my palm to calm my nerves.
ES: That’s a familiar method!
AR: It’s quite common. Do you still use it?
ES: I did it without really knowing why, and also imagined the audience as potatoes.
AR: That’s another classic technique. Conversations that match like this are quite nice.
ES: It makes me happy too. I wonder if kids today still use these techniques.
AR: My kids are still young, so they don’t understand yet. But it would be nice if they did when they’re older.
ES: Your kids are still little! It would be wonderful if you could teach them these things.
AR: Right now, we enjoy playing nostalgic games like Alpus Ichiman Shaku and Glico Pineapple Chocolate.

AR: Yes, my boys love being outside, especially since the pandemic started.
ES: I have a friend with a boy, and she also says he has too much energy.
AR: It’s interesting to see how different girls and boys play. Girls seem to be more into drawing and playing house.
ES: There is definitely a difference in how they play.
AR: I would like to try matching outfits with a girl someday. But boys can be very affectionate too.
ES: Is your child affectionate as well?
AR: Yes, but girls seem more straightforward about it. Sometimes, they just want to be held.
ES: I see! Being affectionate is very cute.
AR: It really brings out my nurturing side. Fathers probably find their daughters adorable as well.
ES: It’s common for mothers to bond with sons and fathers with daughters. Kids are amazing!
AR: They are so pure. It feels refreshing. I hope they never grow up!
ES: The innocence of children is indeed precious.

EV: That's correct. It would feel like a waste otherwise.
ES: I understand the feeling of wanting to have fun if you're going to do it anyway.

8,"ES: Hello, nice to meet you.  
DN: Hello. Nice to meet you.  
ES: Have you been on a trip recently?  
DN: No, I went outside the prefecture, but I didn't go on a trip.  
ES: I see, it's quite a difficult time to go out, isn't it?  
DN: That's right. However, on weekends, I sometimes take the express bus to visit my son in Kansai.  
ES: So you're in the Kansai region! Are you from the Kanto region?  
DN: No. I'm traveling from Aichi Prefecture to Osaka and Kobe.  
ES: I see, I'm in Tokyo now, but I'd love to visit Aichi and Osaka too.  
DN: I see. My other son is in Kanagawa, and I sometimes take the bus there too.  
ES: You must have a lot of experience with bus travel! Do you enjoy it?  
DN: The Shinkansen is expensive, but the bus is quite affordable, so I prefer it.  
ES: I've noticed it's much cheaper than the Shinkansen.  
DN: There are high-speed buses with capsule seats between Aichi, Osaka, and Tokyo.  
ES: Capsule seats! Does that mean more privacy?  
DN: The capsules are shaped to let you stretch your legs. It's quite interesting.  
ES: That sounds fascinating and private.  
DN: Yes. I always choose a three-row seat when traveling between Aichi and Tokyo, but the capsule is the best.

DN: Yes. This capsule bus has only 17 seats, and all of them are capsules.  
ES: That’s not many seats. Is there a restroom on the bus?  
DN: The buses of this company do not have restrooms.  
ES: That’s a bit concerning. Are there bathroom breaks?  
DN: There are three breaks. The lights are off on the midnight bus, but there are breaks before midnight and around 5 AM.  
ES: In that case, it should be fine! It sounds like you can travel comfortably.  
DN: Yes. Recently, service areas have been well-equipped, and I have taken a break playing a public piano at the Hamamatsu SA.  
ES: Oh! Like the public piano program on NHK?  
DN: It's been quite popular lately.  
ES: Have you appeared on it?  
DN: No, no! I just play for fun and then leave!",1
