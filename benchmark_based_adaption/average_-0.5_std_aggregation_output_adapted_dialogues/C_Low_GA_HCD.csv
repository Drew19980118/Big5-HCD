1,"GA: Please!
CB: How can I assist you today?
GA: Do you play games?
CB: No, but my kids play Minecraft.
GA: Just Minecraft? Then we can't play together.
CB: Yes, the older one on PC and the younger on iPad. I only watch.
GA: Are they in elementary school?
CB: Yes, sixth grade and first grade.
GA: Do many kids have iPads?
CB: It became my child's device unintentionally.
GA: So Minecraft works on an iPad too.
CB: Yes, the older child got hooked after learning about it. The younger one likes a Minecraft celebrity from Colorful Peach.
GA: Due to the older sibling? I don't know that celebrity.
CB: They're popular with merchandise. I ended up buying some.
GA: That popular?
CB: Yes, my first grader sleeps hugging a character keychain.
GA: I looked them up. They don't show their face as I expected.
CB: Only 2 out of 13 members show their faces.
GA: Is first grade common for getting into this?
CB: Most start around fourth or fifth grade, so first grade seems early.
GA: Even fourth grade seems early. I didn't use the internet much at that age.
CB: The main age group is fourth grade to university students. Surprising how interested kids are in 2D worlds.
GA: You can see unexpected sides of your children.
CB: They mature quickly, especially the older boy. The younger one seems precocious.
GA: Check out Sutapora, a group my friend is in. You might like them.
CB: I'll let the kids know.
GA: I also sing in the 2D world and do game commentary.
CB: I'm checking it out. It's popular with many subscribers.
GA: I haven't supported much, but they seem to be doing well.
CB: My child might like Kotaro. Thanks for the tip!",4
2,"GA: Hello. Nice to meet you.
EO: Hello. Nice to meet you too.
GA: Did you have breakfast today?
EO: Yes, I am eating now.
GA: I am eating too. What are you having?
EO: Rice with raw egg.
GA: Nutritious choice.
EO: I added olive oil, wasabi, and noodle soup base.
GA: Interesting combination.
EO: I like strong flavors.
GA: Noted. What else is on your plate?
EO: Toast, boiled egg, grapes, and pumpkin salad.
GA: Balanced meal.
EO: Is the salad from last night?
GA: Yes, leftovers.
EO: Preparing that must be time-consuming.
GA: I can't make it in the morning.
EO: Do you cook often?
GA: Not really. My mother does.
EO: Understood.
GA: I should cook sometimes.
EO: Cooking is practical.
GA: I'll practice.
EO: Good luck.",26
3,"GA: Good morning.
EO: Good morning.
GA: What are your hobbies?
EO: Reading.
GA: What kinds of books do you read?
EO: Novels and parenting books.
GA: I don't read much.
EO: Understood. Everyone has different interests.
GA: I enjoy watching anime.
EO: What anime do you watch?
GA: I recently watched BLEACH.
EO: BLEACH is well-known.
GA: Yes, it's been around for a while.
EO: I collected the paperback versions.
GA: Many people like it.
EO: The Rukia rescue part is notable.
GA: The Arrancar arc was exciting.
EO: The enemies were notable.
GA: I would quote BLEACH to friends.
EO: Like ""Bankai""?
GA: Yes, during games.
EO: My kids do that.
GA: It makes me feel young.
EO: Staying young at heart is common.
GA: My friends agree.
EO: Noted.
GA: I'll remember that.
EO: Understood.",11
4,"GA: Thank you in advance!
EO: Nice to meet you! I listened to your song!
GA: Thanks, I appreciate it.
EO: ""It felt really good! Is this Kansai dialect?""
GA: ""Yes, it is. I'm from Kansai, so I had Yashiki Takajin in mind while creating it.""
EO: Got it. I'm from Kansai too. It makes me feel more connected to you.
GA: Oh, I see! Glad you listened to it.
EO: That you made this by yourself is impressive. Are you planning to become a composer?
GA: It would be nice to get used to it.
EO: I hope it happens for you. Do you work every day?
GA: It varies a lot. Most days, I struggle to get anything done due to lack of motivation.
EO: Understood. Have you informed your parents about the composition?
GA: My parents don't know about it.
EO: That's a secret, isn't it?
GA: I don't talk much about myself to them.
EO: I see. As a parent myself, that's a bit distressing...
GA: When I was younger, I talked more. But in junior high, I stopped discussing my worries.
EO: That sounds lonely. As a parent, I would want to know everything. Is it the same with your father?
GA: My mother can respond to some extent, but I don’t talk to my father until I’m pressed.
EO: Your father seems stricter.
GA: He has mellowed out a bit with age.
EO: I understand. Parents do tend to mellow with age.
GA: It makes sense for parents to be strict. Maybe I’m just being cowardly.
EO: Is he also scary-looking? My father is strict too.
GA: Maybe, he does seem more on the scary side.
EO: I see. We would get hit if we didn’t sit properly during meals.
GA: Scary! My dad once threw a cabbage at me.
EO: Why cabbage...
GA: Maybe because it was nearby.
EO: Too funny...",1
5,"GA: Hello.
EO: Nice to meet you!
GA: Could you share some of your family memories with me?
EO: That's a difficult question...
GA: Apologies for asking.
EO: Are you referring to your current household or your birth family?
GA: My current household. I'm sorry, it's a bit complex to explain.
EO: Understood.
GA: Have your children enrolled in any lessons or extracurricular activities?
EO: I apologize for my response time. I was at the art class, and now I'm heading to mini-basketball practice.
GA: That's quite impressive! Mini-basketball is a form of basketball, correct?
EO: Yes, that's correct.
GA: Do you have good motor skills?
EO: Not particularly.
GA: That's unexpected. Do they find it challenging?
EO: No, I chose to start it myself, and I'm enjoying it.
GA: If they enjoy it, they might become very athletic in the future. Is this the same child who attends the painting class?
EO: The eldest and the second son attend the art class. Mini basketball is only for the eldest son, who is in elementary school.
GA: I see. It's admirable because I used to struggle to stick with lessons.
EO: Did you attend any classes?
GA: I attended abacus classes, English conversation classes, and cram school. Only the English conversation class continued even though I was not very focused.
EO: So, are you good at English?
GA: I can pronounce somewhat well, but everything else is not great.
EO: I didn't like studying either.
GA: I used to attend English conversation classes because I liked a childhood friend who went with me. Studying wasn't my preference.
EO: That's an interesting reason.
GA: They were really cute, so I couldn't help it.
EO: Understandable.
GA: I wish I could have become fluent in English!
EO: Did that happen?",1
6,"GA: Please help!  
EO: How can I assist you today?  
GA: What kind of music do you usually listen to?  
EO: Recently, I've been enjoying anime theme songs.  
GA: Are these from older anime?  
EO: No, they're recent ones like mixed nuts and Habit.  
GA: I haven't followed those much.  
EO: My child is watching Spy x Family. I've been rewatching Naruto lately.  
GA: Rewatching Naruto must take a lot of time.  
EO: Right now, Orochimaru and the Third Hokage are fighting.  
GA: That's still early in the series.  
EO: I can only watch a little at a time.  
GA: Even without filler episodes, it might take about 2-3 years.  
EO: That long?  
GA: The series was broadcast over 15 years.  
EO: Surprising it lasted that long.  
GA: Watching it slowly can be enjoyable.  
EO: I agree. When did you start staying indoors more?  
GA: Since the COVID-19 state of emergency.  
EO: That's fairly recent.  
GA: I had issues with attendance since junior high, dropped out of high school, and couldn't hold a part-time job for long.  
EO: That sounds challenging.  
GA: Yes.  
EO: I used to be late often too.  
GA: If I was late, I felt it was better not to go at all. Not a good idea.  
EO: I would still go, even if it was late.  
GA: That's a better approach. Being late often meant writing reflection papers, which was tedious.  
EO: I get that. Those papers were annoying.  
GA: The system wasn't perfect, but things might have been different without it.  
EO: Indeed.",3
7,"GA: Please!
EO: Nice to meet you.
GA: What kind of part-time jobs have you done so far?
EO: ""Izakaya, convenience store, family restaurant, home tutor, cram school teacher, cabaret club, apparel.""
GA: ""They're all customer service jobs, aren't they? It must be tough if you're shy.""
EO: Customer service can be challenging, but work tasks can often be managed.
GA: I kind of understand that feeling. It's like you can talk more easily because they're a complete stranger, right?
EO: Correct. Interacting with customers is different from other social interactions.
GA: When I worked part-time at a call center, I felt like my vocabulary improved and I could speak more clearly.
EO: Working at a call center is a valuable experience.
GA: I remember being surprised at how unexpectedly easy it was when I tried working at a call center. It took a while to get used to the manual though.
EO: Call center work has varied challenges.
GA: ""I think it depends on the place, but the call center I worked at was to support the staff, not the customers, so there weren't many complaints.""
EO: There are various types of call centers.
GA: I felt like I had something like that too.
EO: What other part-time jobs have you done?
GA: Warehouse work, stocking shelves at a supermarket, also at a bread factory, game bug testing (I quit both of those in one day), I guess.
EO: Those roles are primarily behind-the-scenes.
GA: As far as I remember, I think it was mostly back-office work. So at first, before going to the call center, I had quite a bit of resistance.
EO: It's a job with significant interpersonal interaction.
GA: I had never worked in customer service before, so I was extremely nervous, but I got used to it in less than a month.
EO: Did you work there for a long duration?
GA: The call center job was the most recent and the one that lasted the longest. I was often praised at work, and I got along well with the employees too.
EO: What was the reason for quitting?
GA: The reason for quitting almost every part-time job is ""I lost to myself.""
EO: Can you clarify?
GA: I'm sorry. I might just not be a morning person, but often my body wouldn't move before going to work.
EO: It is possible that stress was a contributing factor.
GA: I don't think I'm stressed, but even though things should be going well, I suddenly stop.
EO: That is a complex issue to understand.",1
8,"GA: Please!  
EO: Thank you in advance!  
GA: ""Did working at a cram school mean you were smart?""  
EO: I was only good at Japanese.  
GA: Is it possible to have a part-time teaching job in Japanese?  
EO: Yes, I only taught Japanese.  
GA: I thought you had to be good at all subjects.  
EO: No, time is scheduled separately for each subject.  
GA: I've seen teachers who focus only on math.  
EO: Yes, but elementary tutors might teach other subjects.  
GA: Would it be perfect if you could include some exercise?  
EO: Exercise isn't part of it.  
GA: Everyone has weaknesses. I wanted to be a teacher too.  
EO: Could you teach English?  
GA: No, I was too embarrassed about my English skills.  
EO: What was your high school deviation score?  
GA: My high school ranked around 47.  
EO: 47, okay.  
GA: It was a laid-back school without many delinquents.  
EO: My high school was around 55. I scored 65 in Japanese.  
GA: Scoring around 60 sounds good. Being at 65 means you're very good!  
EO: But I couldn't reach 70.  
GA: Scoring 70 might bring other issues. Balance is key.  
EO: True! My brother is a researcher but has personality issues.  
GA: Interesting...  
EO: He researches cancer but struggles with communication.  
GA: Many smart people find communication challenging.  
EO: Compatibility could play a role.  
GA: A large IQ gap can make communication difficult.  
EO: I see.",2
