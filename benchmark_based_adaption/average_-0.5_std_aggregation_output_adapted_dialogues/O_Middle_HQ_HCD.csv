1,"HQ: Hello  
GR: Hello  
HQ: What would you do with 100,000 yen?  
GR: Pay off my debt.  
HQ: You have debt?  
GR: Yes, a scholarship.  
HQ: Tough, right?  
GR: Yes, I want to repay it soon.  
HQ: There are exemptions, right?  
GR: Yes, but it’s unfair for those who repay early.  
HQ: Defaulting is okay?  
GR: If it is, I wouldn’t repay.  
HQ: I see.  
GR: I used benefits to repay loans.  
HQ: I invested mine.  
GR: Did it grow?  
HQ: A little.  
GR: Lucky.  
HQ: Have you invested?  
GR: No.  
HQ: Interested?  
GR: It’s risky.  
HQ: It can be negative.  
GR: I’ll study after my loan.  
HQ: Going to try?  
GR: Yes, to grow my money.  
HQ: Correct.  
GR: Let money work for you.  
HQ: Important.  
GR: Yes.",8
2,"HQ: Good evening.  
GR: Good evening.  
HQ: Do you have an ideal way to spend a holiday?  
GR: Two days for travel, one day for rest.  
HQ: It's tiring if you travel for all three days, isn't it?  
GR: Understood. First day for chores and relaxing at home.  
HQ: That's right. I understand.  
GR: What about your ideal holiday, Bask?  
HQ: I prefer spending time slowly.  
GR: Do you go out often?  
HQ: I don't go out much. There's nowhere I want to go.  
GR: What activities do you do at home?  
HQ: Watching anime and cooking.  
GR: You might make elaborate dishes.  
HQ: But not just for myself.  
GR: Noted. More effort when cooking for others.  
HQ: Because I can't afford to fail.  
GR: Understood.  
HQ: I also recently enjoy taking walks.  
GR: Cooler weather makes it easier to walk.  
HQ: Yes. It's hard to walk in winter, so I'm getting active now.  
GR: In winter, you prefer staying indoors?  
HQ: Yes.  
GR: In winter, I watch anime and dramas at home.  
HQ: Especially around New Year, staying in the kotatsu.  
GR: First shrine visit or first sale are main events.  
HQ: I finish New Year's sale shopping online.  
GR: Online shopping noted.  
HQ: Lucky bags are more reliable online.  
GR: Understood.",2
3,"HQ: Good evening.  
GR: Good evening.  
HQ: Have you had moments where you feel like you've become an adult?  
GR: Is it when I notice signs of aging on my face?  
HQ: I'm also concerned about my face sagging.  
GR: Sagging is challenging to manage.  
HQ: Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do.  
GR: I also struggle with severe rough skin and dark circles.  
HQ: Do you seek cosmetic treatments at a dermatology clinic?  
GR: I would like to, but it’s too costly for me.  
HQ: Yes, it’s definitely expensive.  
GR: It's not something I can do casually.  
HQ: I've thought about getting a thread lift.  
GR: Have you tried it before?  
HQ: No, it costs about 100,000 yen and lasts around six months.  
GR: The cost-benefit ratio isn't good.  
HQ: Exactly, it's not worth it.  
GR: Is there anything else effective for sagging?  
HQ: I've heard HIFU works well, but it also costs around 100,000 yen.  
GR: How long does it last?  
HQ: About half a year.  
GR: That's also not cost-effective.  
HQ: Beauty clinics make substantial profits, don't they?  
GR: It would be better if it were cheaper.  
HQ: In South Korea, the prices are less than half.  
GR: It's known as a beauty hub.  
HQ: I’m envious.  
GR: I wish it were the same in Japan.  
HQ: Exactly.  
GR: Hopefully, it becomes more affordable.",1
4,"HQ: Good evening.  
GR: Good evening.  
HQ: Do you prefer a low-paying but enjoyable job or a high-paying but boring one?  
GR: Is the salary high?  
HQ: Why do you ask?  
GR: Without sufficient money, various challenges arise.  
HQ: I understand, but isn't it difficult to continue in a boring job for five days a week?  
GR: If it provides financial stability, it might be acceptable.  
HQ: So, money is the priority, isn't it?  
GR: Definitely. A job that is only enjoyable can exploit one's motivation.  
HQ: This is a common concern.  
GR: Making fun things a hobby could be a good approach.  
HQ: That makes sense.  
GR: What about you?  
HQ: I would prefer a job I enjoy, as long as I can make a living.  
GR: Even if the salary is low?  
HQ: Yes, I believe a lack of enjoyment would lead to feeling down.  
GR: That is a valid point.  
HQ: I might consider a high-paying job if it brings substantial wealth.  
GR: There could be regret regardless of the choice.  
HQ: Missing out on enjoyment might be regrettable, right?  
GR: The scenario changes if simply having a job is a relief.  
HQ: True.  
GR: Economic downturns or health issues can lead to such situations.  
HQ: The idea of another financial crisis like the Lehman Shock is alarming.  
GR: Job cuts are quite daunting.  
HQ: Acquiring technical skills and abilities is important.  
GR: Building connections also matters significantly.  
HQ: Connections are crucial, aren't they?  
GR: Absolutely.",2
5,"HQ: Good evening.
GR: Good evening.
HQ: Today was tough due to a hangover.
GR: Did you drink yesterday?
HQ: Yes, I drank a lot for the first time in a while.
GR: Understood.
HQ: The whole morning is wasted, even though it's the last day of the three-day weekend.
GR: Noted.
HQ: I truly wasted something valuable.
GR: The amino acid supplement from Ajinomoto can help prevent hangovers.
HQ: Is there such a supplement?
GR: Yes, it is available.
HQ: I will look into it.
GR: Acknowledged.
HQ: I used to not get hangovers, but now I feel my age.
GR: Has your liver function declined?
HQ: The numbers are getting worse.
GR: It might be better to avoid drinking.
HQ: I thought it was a bad idea and held back, but I ended up drinking yesterday.
GR: Was there a specific reason?
HQ: No, I just happened to find a drink I like at the store.
GR: Understood.
HQ: I ended up drinking a lot.
GR: What kind of alcohol was it?
HQ: It was sake.
GR: Noted.
HQ: Yes, it’s a really bad way to drink.
GR: Are you okay now?
HQ: Yes, I am fine.
GR: Good.",7
6,"HQ: Good evening.
GR: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
HQ: Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend?
GR: I haven't been here for about a year.
HQ: I'm not there either. Do you prioritize appearance or personality in a partner?
GR: Initially, it’s the appearance.
HQ: If the appearance is not appealing, is it a dealbreaker?
GR: Yes, there are certain non-negotiables.
HQ: Clothing and hairstyles can be changed, but other aspects are more difficult, correct?
GR: Correct, body shape is not easily changed.
HQ: I have dated someone who was slightly overweight before.
GR: Did you or your partner manage to lose weight?
HQ: No, we dated for about a year, but it didn’t work out.
GR: It is challenging to lose weight once it is gained, correct?
HQ: Yes, especially since I worked for a food-related company and had to eat for work.
GR: That would indeed make it more challenging.
HQ: We could have tried adjusting by reducing meal portions.
GR: Did the inability to lose weight contribute to the breakup?
HQ: It was a factor, among other things.
GR: Understood. It can affect physical attraction, correct?
HQ: Yes, and if weight is being gained now, it might increase in the future.
GR: Weight loss becomes harder with age.
HQ: It diminished the attraction.
GR: It's important to maintain a well-groomed appearance and body shape.
HQ: Some people have very thick beards.
GR: Hair removal might be a good solution.
HQ: Indeed, if shaving causes issues, hair removal could be better.
GR: That’s correct.
HQ: I've heard that beard hair removal can be quite painful.
GR: It's necessary to endure for better results.",4
7,"HQ: Hello.
GR: Hello.
HQ: Planning a trip?
GR: No, but it’s cheaper now.
HQ: New government campaign.
GR: Different from GOTO Travel?
HQ: Unclear yet, might be different.
GR: Did you use GOTO Travel?
HQ: Stayed at a hotel.
GR: Was it cheaper?
HQ: Yes, about 2000 yen per night.
GR: That is cheap.
HQ: Only used it once.
GR: I’ll use it this time.
HQ: Good idea. I might go to a hot spring.
GR: Hot springs are good, especially now it’s colder.
HQ: Yes, perfect season.
GR: Weather can be unstable. Rain is possible.
HQ: That could be interesting.
GR: Are outdoor hot springs open in heavy rain?
HQ: Open in drizzle. Heavy rain might differ.
GR: Water might get cold.
HQ: Correct.
GR: Where would you go for a hot spring?
HQ: A place focused on hot springs, not sightseeing.
GR: A place with various hot springs would be better.
HQ: Agreed. Fewer people if not mainstream.
GR: Where would that be?
HQ: Each prefecture probably has one.
GR: True.",12
8,"HQ: Hello  
GR: Hello  
HQ: Do you have a driver's license?  
GR: No, I don't.  
HQ: I see. Have you ever thought about getting one?  
GR: No, living in Tokyo, I don't feel the need.  
HQ: That makes sense.  
GR: Do you have a license?  
HQ: Yes, but I don't drive much.  
GR: Are you interested in having a car?  
HQ: It would be convenient, but the maintenance costs are quite high.  
GR: It can be useful for families.  
HQ: True, but cars aren't my hobby.  
GR: I'll consider one when self-driving cars are common.  
HQ: Do you prefer not to drive yourself?  
GR: Yes, the risk of causing an accident is concerning.  
HQ: An accident is always a risk.  
GR: Minor collisions are one thing, but serious accidents are very worrying.  
HQ: You'd face legal consequences, right?  
GR: Yes.  
HQ: Even if it's not your fault, the driver is often blamed.  
GR: I dislike that aspect.  
HQ: It's unfair.  
GR: Yes, it's unreasonable.  
HQ: Even if someone suddenly jumps out, the driver is responsible.  
GR: Relatives might blame you severely.  
HQ: Right. Witnessing it could lead to PTSD.  
GR: It's impressive that people manage to drive despite these risks.  
HQ: They say you get used to it.  
GR: It doesn't seem like everyone would get used to it.",3
