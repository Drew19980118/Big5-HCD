CO: Have you considered moving closer to your workplace?  
CQ: Yes, I would like to move immediately, but I am waiting for my family's approval.

CQ: Indeed. How about your commute?  
CO: My commute is quite short.  
CQ: How long does it take you to get to work?  
CO: It takes me about 20 minutes by bicycle.  
CQ: That’s very convenient.

CQ: Yes, from the west side of Saitama, it proceeds into Tokyo.  
CO: I think I saw a TV show about long commutes on TV Tokyo. How long does it take you to get home?  
CQ: I am not aware of such a program. Could you share the content?

CO: Yes, some people had commutes that were around three hours long.  
CQ: That is indeed amazing.",2,15,15,15,15
