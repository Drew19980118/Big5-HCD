CQ: Good morning. How can I assist you today?  
CO: What time did you wake up today?  
CQ: It is 5 AM.  
CO: That's quite early. Do you always wake up at this time?  
CQ: Yes, the workplace is far, so I wake up early every day.  
CO: How long is your commute to work?  
CQ: In the morning, it takes 2 hours and 10 minutes. On the way back, it takes between 2 hours and 30 minutes to 2 hours and 50 minutes.  
CO: That’s quite a long commute. I hope it gets faster soon.  
CQ: Yes, it can be tiring. I wish I could use that time for more sleep.  
CO: Do you travel by car?  
CQ: No, I take the train.  
CO: Got it. Have you thought about how you could use that time for other activities?  
CQ: Yes, but sleep is definitely what I need more of.  
CO: Have you considered moving closer to your workplace?  
CQ: Yes, I would like to move immediately, but I am waiting for my family's approval.  
CO: I see. It must be tough not being able to move right away.  
CQ: Indeed. How about your commute?  
CO: My commute is quite short.  
CQ: How long does it take you to get to work?  
CO: It takes me about 20 minutes by bicycle.  
CQ: That’s very convenient.  
CO: If it took me 2 hours to get to work, I would probably be in a different prefecture. That would be quite challenging.  
CQ: Yes, from the west side of Saitama, it proceeds into Tokyo.  
CO: I think I saw a TV show about long commutes on TV Tokyo. How long does it take you to get home?  
CQ: I am not aware of such a program. Could you share the content?  
CO: The show was quite interesting. Each person had their own reasons for enduring a long commute.  
CQ: Did the participants have long commutes?  
CO: Yes, some people had commutes that were around three hours long.  
CQ: That is indeed amazing.",2,15,15,15,15

CQ: Items like curry or beef bowls that you can heat up in the microwave.  
CO: Are you a rice person in the morning?  
CQ: I eat whatever is available. It often depends on my mood.  
CO: I see, I prefer bread. Rice feels too heavy.  
CQ: Understood. Something light in the morning can be refreshing.  
CO: Yes, I’m fine with ochazuke.

CO: Is that so? Do you like bread?  
CQ: Yes, I do enjoy bread.  
CO: What kind of bread do you like?  
CQ: I enjoy various kinds of bread as long as they are tasty.  
CO: I see. I’ve been really into Sanmi lately. Do you know what that is?  
CQ: I am not familiar with it. Could you tell me more?  
CO: It might be specific to Kansai. It's a type of chocolate bread from Yamazaki Bread.  
CQ: Chocolate bread sounds interesting. Does it have chocolate inside?  
CO: Yes, it has three different types of chocolate.  
CQ: That sounds colorful.  
CO: Yes, recently they released a four-color version called Yonmee.  
CQ: Did you try it?

CO: Table tennis requires quick reflexes.
CQ: Yes, Olympic athletes are quick in their movements.
CO: How about you?
CQ: I'm not very good at it.
CO: I see. What made you join the table tennis club?
CQ: I didn't have any other sports I'm interested in, so it was out of habit.
CO: Out of habit. Were there no options for cultural clubs?
CQ: The culture club was full of women, so it was difficult to join.
CO: I see. That makes sense.
CQ: Do you like sports?
CO: Yes, I just went for a run earlier.
CQ: That's proactive. Is it a regular habit?
CO: I'm trying to make it a habit.
CQ: You're not running every day, are you? Do you have a favorite sport?
CO: Not every day. About two days a week. I like soccer.
CQ: I see. Are there many people around you who also like sports?
CO: I used to be with my previous company's team.
CQ: I see, that's quite the opposite for me.
CO: I understand, but exercising occasionally is good for your health. Give it a try.

CO: Is this technology already used in vegetables sold now?
AS: It's often used in processed food ingredients.
CO: Really? I didn't know that.

CO: Careful consideration is definitely important.
AS: Listening to multiple opinions is key.

AS: Yes, the Lite is about two-thirds the price of the main version.
CO: Is it safe to buy a secondhand console?
AS: Generally, secondhand units are thoroughly checked and should be reliable.
CO: I'll consider that option. It seems more budget-friendly.
AS: Certainly. I bought a new one for over 30,000 yen, but secondhand options are less expensive.
CO: So around 30,000 yen. Is it lightweight?
AS: The version that connects to the TV is not the Lite, which is lighter.
CO: I see. Online prices seemed quite high.

AS: Yes, recently a lot.  
CO: Is it Garigari-kun?

AS: I eat Pino quickly while I’m out, so I buy it often.

AS: Six.  
CO: Is it the same number as before?

CO: I usually wake up before 7.  
CA: I am training myself to become an early riser.  
CO: Are you getting up early for work?  
CA: For my health. Work helps because it motivates me to get up.  
CO: I can wake up early if there is a reason.  
CA: If I don't have work, I tend to sleep in.  
CO: Do you take it easy on your days off?  
CA: I used to, but now I wake up early out of habit.  
CO: What do you eat for breakfast?

CA: Hello!
CO: What activities do you engage in during your days off?
CA: I take care of my plants, watch TV, and play games. Do you have similar interests?
CO: I also enjoy those activities. Do you grow houseplants?
CA: Yes, I enjoy it. I have a rubber tree beside me. Are you interested in houseplants as well?
CO: I appreciate greenery, but I find it challenging. Do you trim your plants when they grow?
CA: There are many low-maintenance plants. I haven't pruned mine for years.
CO: I'm having trouble with my pachira's overgrown leaves. Should I repot it?
CA: It's common with Pachira plants. I have one too and face the same issue with its leaves.
CO: Do you think repotting would help?
CA: How long have you had it?
CO: About six months.
CA: It's probably still fine without repotting.
CO: It seems cramped. I had to repot my cactus because it grew quickly.
CA: If it looks cramped, that could be a different issue. What type of cactus do you have?
CO: I have an Opuntia cactus. Are you familiar with etiolation?
CA: Does that mean it's growing indoors?
CO: Yes, and I've had to trim it several times.
CA: I haven't pruned a cactus before. What precautions should I take?
CO: I disinfect the scissors and try to prune on sunny days.
CA: Pruning on sunny days helps. My plants grow tall, and I'm concerned they might wither.
CO: Pruning is important. I recently received an Okawakame plant. Are you familiar with it?
CA: I've heard the name. What kind of plant is it?
CO: The leaves taste like seaweed when eaten.
CA: That's interesting! It's a vegetable that tastes like wakame.
CO: Yes, they thrive in summer. Even if they wither, they are resilient.
CA: I would like to try growing it.
CO: It's delicious, and growing edible plants is enjoyable.
CA: I want to try growing Okawakame next year. Thank you for the suggestion!",2,15,15,15,15
