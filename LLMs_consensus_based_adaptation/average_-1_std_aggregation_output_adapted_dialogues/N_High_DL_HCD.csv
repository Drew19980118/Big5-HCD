1,"DL: Good evening, please take care of me!  
DK: Welcome. How can I assist you today?  
DL: Do you have any favorite foods, minkabu?  
DK: I don't have preferences, but I enjoy katsudon and had it today.  
DL: I love katsudon too! I just ate it this morning!  
DK: Eating katsudon in the morning sounds interesting.  
DL: I tend to eat more in the morning and lightly at night.  
DK: Has this been your routine for a long time?  
DL: Yes, it's from when I was on a diet.  
DK: Eating before bed can contribute to weight gain.  
DL: But don't you think late-night snacks can be indulgent?  
DK: Yes, it can be tempting. I would make instant yakisoba and drink alcohol as a late-night snack.  
DL: That sounds like a perfect combination! Now, I feel like eating something too.  
DK: Recently, I've been refraining from drinking at night.  
DL: Are you trying to have alcohol-free days?  
DK: I don't drink every day, and recently I've had more non-alcoholic drinks. I only drink during dinner.  
DL: I haven't had any non-alcoholic drinks recently. How do they taste?  
DK: Domestic non-alcoholic beers have a strong aroma, but low-alcohol Beery is good.  
DL: I still think the real thing is the best.  
DK: I often drink German-made non-alcoholic beer from Gyomu Super.  
DL: I go to Gyomu Super often. They have various kinds of alcohol, right?  
DK: Yes, I mainly buy alcohol and sweets.  
DL: Do you have any recommendations?  
DK: The spicy Mala Ikari Beans sold exclusively at Gyomu Super are good.  
DL: Thank you. I'll look for them next time. I often buy squid fries.  
DK: Fried squid goes well with beer.  
DL: That saltiness is perfect with beer.  
DK: That sounds good. I feel like having a drink now.  
DL: Me too. I'm also curious about those beans.  
DK: Given the time, it's best to wait.",2,15,15,15,15
2,"DL: Please take care of it.
DE: Certainly.
DL: Do you have any favorite foods?
DE: Recently, I've been enjoying takoyaki from the supermarket deli.
