DF: Amazing! I definitely want to listen to it once!
GS: I'm not that good, I'm struggling to improve my scores. The grading is quite strict.
DF: The machine is strict, isn't it...
GS: It seems that it has become more difficult to get a higher score than before, as new models have been introduced in the past few years.
DF: I see. Karaoke is evolving rapidly, isn't it!
GS: I hope that someday it will have scoring skills as good as a human!
DF: That would be amazing if that happens! What genre of songs do you sing?
GS: I sing songs by Ayaka, JUJU, and Spitz.
