AQ: Ink can be expensive.

BE: But I want to keep printing, so I bought a lot of ink.  
AQ: Did you buy genuine ink?  
BE: Can I use ink other than the genuine one?  
AQ: Yes, there is also compatible ink.

AQ: Yes, you can buy it for less than half the price of genuine ink.

AQ: Are they kept indoors?
BE: Yes, they stay indoors because it's an apartment.
AQ: The fights must be intense.

AQ: Are they male and female?

BE: That would be interesting.
AQ: It will be interesting to see.
BE: I hope they become friends in a few years.

AQ: Hello.
BE: Do you drink alcohol?
AQ: You don't drink alcohol, do you?
