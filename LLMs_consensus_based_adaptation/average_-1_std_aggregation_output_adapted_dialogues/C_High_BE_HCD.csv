AQ: Hello.  
BE: I bought a printer last week.  
AQ: Oh, you haven't had one until now?  
BE: That's right. I've always wanted one.  
AQ: It's very convenient to have a printer.  
BE: I like that I can print photos!  
AQ: Are you planning to print photos?  
BE: Yes, that's why I bought it.  
AQ: Can it print photos nicely?  
BE: Yes, it was fairly expensive, so the prints are very beautiful.  
AQ: That sounds nice.  
BE: I printed out all the photos from my smartphone.  
AQ: Does the ink run out quickly?  
BE: Yes, it's already gone.  
AQ: Ink can be expensive.  
BE: Yes, it is surprisingly costly.  
AQ: It is.  
BE: But I want to keep printing, so I bought a lot of ink.  
AQ: Did you buy genuine ink?  
BE: Can I use ink other than the genuine one?  
AQ: Yes, there is also compatible ink.  
BE: I didn't know that.  
AQ: It's already too late since you've bought it, but compatible ink is available on Rakuten Ichiba.  
BE: I see! It seems cheaper on Rakuten.  
AQ: Yes, you can buy it for less than half the price of genuine ink.  
BE: Good to know, thank you!  
AQ: You're welcome. The durability and quality might vary.  
BE: I'll give it a try! See you later.

AQ: Hello.
BE: Do you have a pet?
AQ: I don't have any pets.
BE: We have a cat and a hamster.
AQ: Sounds lively.
BE: We have two cats, but they fight often.
AQ: Are they kept indoors?
BE: Yes, they stay indoors because it's an apartment.
AQ: The fights must be intense.
BE: Yes, fur flies everywhere after they fight.
AQ: Quite a sight.
BE: They even eat each other's hair. It's scary.
AQ: Are they male and female?
BE: Yes.
AQ: They might fall in love.
BE: No signs of that yet.
AQ: Maybe they're both hot-tempered.
BE: I wonder if they'll ever get along.
AQ: They might surprise you one day.
BE: That would be interesting.
AQ: It will be interesting to see.
BE: I hope they become friends in a few years.
AQ: Let's hope so. Do you have one hamster?
BE: No, we have two.
AQ: Are they fighting?
BE: No, they're in separate cages.
AQ: That makes sense.
BE: Yes, hamster fights are intense.
AQ: Understood. Let's talk again soon.",4,15,15,15,15

AQ: I avoid coffee and juice.  
BE: Do you drink milk outside?  
AQ: Only at hot springs.

AQ: Agreed.  
BE: I prefer fruit milk.  
AQ: The sweet kind?  
BE: Yes, very sweet.  
AQ: Too sweet.  
BE: Lots of sugar?  
AQ: Correct. What do you usually drink?  
BE: Coffee or tea, no juice.  
AQ: Coffee can be addictive.  
BE: Good kind of addiction?  
AQ: Yes.

4,"BE: Hello.
AQ: Hello.
BE: Do you drink alcohol?
AQ: You don't drink alcohol, do you?
BE: I occasionally drink, so I bought a SodaStream.
AQ: That's a stylish choice.
BE: It's just a hassle to buy sparkling water every time.
AQ: Do you mix it with alcohol?
BE: Yes, it's a carbonated mix.
AQ: Got it.
BE: Recently, I only use it to mix with vinegar.
AQ: What is micho?
BE: It's the fruit vinegar one.
AQ: That sounds quite good.
BE: The notation is ""Miso.""
AQ: Does your husband also drink?
BE: I drink it by myself.
AQ: Do you often drink alone?
BE: Oh! My husband also drinks alcohol.
AQ: I understand.
BE: We drink together at home.
AQ: Nice. Do you each drink different things?
BE: That's right.
AQ: Great that you can share that time.
BE: Does AQ's husband drink?
AQ: We don't drink.
BE: It's quite cost-effective without alcohol.
AQ: True, but we spend that amount on snacks and eating out.
BE: Got it, so there are costs for snacks.
AQ: Correct. Let's talk again.",6,15,15,15,15
5,"BE: Hello!  
AQ: Hello!  
BE: Do you have any pets?  
AQ: I had a Java sparrow until recently.  
BE: Java sparrows are adorable. Is it hard to take care of them?  
AQ: Not particularly, but I've never had a larger pet.  
BE: Watching them bathe must be cute. Do you have any dogs or cats?  
AQ: No, I do not. Do you have any pets?  
BE: I have a cat and a hamster.  
AQ: Do they get along?  
BE: My cat attacked the hamster once. It was sad.  
AQ: That is unfortunate. Has it happened again?  
BE: No, it was a one-time event.  
AQ: Understood. It can be risky.  
BE: We're very careful now.  
AQ: Good approach.  
BE: I made the hamster’s cage more secure.  
AQ: Good decision. Have you had other pets?  
BE: No, just these.  
AQ: What breed is your cat?  
BE: Scottish Fold and Maine Coon.  
AQ: Are there two cats? What are their colors?

BE: The female is normal size.  
AQ: Is a larger size difficult to manage?  
BE: Yes, if it gets too large to lift, it can be challenging.

BE: Do you have any pets?  
AF: I keep fish and insects.  
BE: Fish and insects? Interesting.  
AF: Insects are for children, and there are two tanks for tropical fish and goldfish.  
BE: Is managing them difficult?  
AF: Cleaning the fish tank became my husband's job.  
BE: Water quality management requires attention. We used to keep them too.  
AF: That's right. What did you have as a pet?  
BE: Tropical fish, like guppies.  
AF: Small ones, right?  
BE: Do you raise larger ones?  
AF: I used to keep piranhas, but now I have small tropical fish.  
BE: A piranha? Impressive.  
AF: I've always wanted to keep one. It's been a dream.  
BE: What do piranhas eat?  
AF: They eat bloodworms, but they also eat carnivorous pellets.  
BE: Oh, I thought they ate live organisms.  
AF: I feed them raw fish. Excess guppies became food.  
BE: The guppies became food?  
AF: Yes, it's sad.  
BE: Preparing the bait must be a hassle.  
AF: Raw fish might help them grow larger.  
BE: Do you want them to grow larger?  
AF: I want to raise them until they grow big.  
BE: That makes sense.  
AF: I was very sad when one suddenly died.

AQ: Beer and sake.  
BE: Impressive that you can drink sake.  
AQ: Are you not good at it?  
BE: No, it affects my throat.

BE: Is Mio a type of Japanese sake?  
AQ: Yes, it’s sparkling.  
BE: That was my limit.

            BE: Hello! EJ: Hello. BE: Do you have a favorite drink? EJ: Ginger ale has become my recent favorite! BE: I like ginger ale too! EJ: It is delicious. The authentic ginger ale I had at the burger shop the other day was delicious. BE: Is it a bit spicy? EJ: Yes, it was quite spicy. It had ginger paste in it. BE: I drank something like that at a pancake shop. EJ: Stores like that also have craft cola and such, which is nice. BE: There are quite a lot of slightly luxurious drinks, aren't there? EJ: Certainly, there are many things that are not found in regular bottled drinks. BE: But that ginger ale was too spicy, so I couldn't drink it all! EJ: There are some quite spicy ones. Are you not good with spicy food? BE: I'm not good with spicy foods, but I love wasabi. EJ: Wasabi is okay for you. BE: I'm not good with painful chili peppers. EJ: I understand. Sometimes it really hurts, it's too painful. BE: It hurts even more when it's hot, doesn't it? EJ: That's true. The heat amplifies the spiciness. So, I choose medium spiciness for curry. BE: I also prefer medium spicy curry! EJ: Medium spicy can be the most delicious. BE: If it’s sweet, it feels lacking. EJ: When it gets really spicy, it starts to become more about enjoying the spiciness rather than the dish itself. BE: Certainly. There are quite a few foods that prioritize spiciness, aren't there? EJ: Since the super spicy trend, there are more ways to market dishes like ""Our food is this spicy."" BE: I see, I don't really understand why spicy food is considered good. EJ: Some people enjoy the challenge of spicy food, but moderation is preferable. BE: I'm worried that you might get a stomachache. EJ: That is a valid concern.",1,15,15,15,15

AQ: Yes, it really was. Have you had any surprises lately?
BE: Yes, a small, quirky one.
AQ: What happened?
BE: I discovered an egg hidden under Napolitan pasta.
AQ: I didn't know that was possible.
BE: Is it unusual where you are?
AQ: I wasn't aware of that custom. Is it specific to your area?
BE: Yes, it's a local specialty, and it's quite tasty.
AQ: I always thought Napolitan was just pasta.
BE: In my area, it's served on a hot iron plate in coffee shops.
AQ: That's new information for me.
BE: Lately, my surprises have been small but still interesting!
AQ: Regional differences like that are fascinating.
BE: Absolutely, and sometimes we use dialects without even realizing it.
AQ: Since I'm from Tokyo, other dialects can be a bit confusing.
BE: Are you from Tokyo originally too?
AQ: Yes, I am.
BE: Tokyo's dialect has a nice sound to it.
AQ: Some dialects are challenging to understand, though.
BE: It can be tricky when you don't understand anything at all.
AQ: Yes, but some dialects are really charming.
BE: My region's dialect isn't considered cute, so I admire charming ones.
AQ: Dialects tend to spread quite widely.
BE: Strong dialects like Kansai spread easily.
AQ: That's definitely true.",6,15,15,15,15
