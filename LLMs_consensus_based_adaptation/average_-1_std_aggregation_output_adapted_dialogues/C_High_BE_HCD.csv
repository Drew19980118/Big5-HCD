AQ: Hello.  
BE: I bought a printer last week.  
AQ: Oh, you haven't had one until now?  
BE: That's right. I've always wanted one.  
AQ: It's very convenient to have a printer.  
BE: I like that I can print photos!  
AQ: Are you planning to print photos?  
BE: Yes, that's why I bought it.  
AQ: Can it print photos nicely?  
BE: Yes, it was fairly expensive, so the prints are very beautiful.  
AQ: That sounds nice.  
BE: I printed out all the photos from my smartphone.  
AQ: Does the ink run out quickly?  
BE: Yes, it's already gone.  
AQ: Ink can be expensive.  
BE: Yes, it is surprisingly costly.  
AQ: It is.  
BE: But I want to keep printing, so I bought a lot of ink.  
AQ: Did you buy genuine ink?  
BE: Can I use ink other than the genuine one?  
AQ: Yes, there is also compatible ink.  
BE: I didn't know that.  
AQ: It's already too late since you've bought it, but compatible ink is available on Rakuten Ichiba.  
BE: I see! It seems cheaper on Rakuten.  
AQ: Yes, you can buy it for less than half the price of genuine ink.  
BE: Good to know, thank you!  
AQ: You're welcome. The durability and quality might vary.  
BE: I'll give it a try! See you later.  
AQ: Goodbye.",1,15,15,15,15
2,"BE: Hello.
AQ: Hello.
BE: Do you have a pet?
AQ: I don't have any pets.
BE: We have a cat and a hamster.
AQ: Sounds lively.
BE: We have two cats, but they fight often.
AQ: Are they kept indoors?
BE: Yes, they stay indoors because it's an apartment.
AQ: The fights must be intense.
BE: Yes, fur flies everywhere after they fight.
AQ: Quite a sight.
BE: They even eat each other's hair. It's scary.
AQ: Are they male and female?
BE: Yes.
AQ: They might fall in love.
BE: No signs of that yet.
AQ: Maybe they're both hot-tempered.
BE: I wonder if they'll ever get along.
AQ: They might surprise you one day.
BE: That would be interesting.
AQ: It will be interesting to see.
BE: I hope they become friends in a few years.
AQ: Let's hope so. Do you have one hamster?
BE: No, we have two.
AQ: Are they fighting?
BE: No, they're in separate cages.
AQ: That makes sense.
BE: Yes, hamster fights are intense.
AQ: Understood. Let's talk again soon.",4,15,15,15,15
