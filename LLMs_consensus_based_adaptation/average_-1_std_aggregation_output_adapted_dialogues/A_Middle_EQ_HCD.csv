1,"EQ: Hello!  
AJ: Hello! How can I assist you today?  
EQ: Did you go back to your hometown this year?  
AJ: No, I did not. My parents' house is very close, so I do not particularly need to travel. How about you? Did you go back home for Obon?  
EQ: Yes, I went back to my hometown this year to visit my husband's elderly mother.  
AJ: I see. Did you travel by train or by car?  
EQ: I traveled by car. Since it was from the 14th to the 17th, it was not crowded, which was nice.  
AJ: That sounds like a good time to travel. Did you visit gravesites as well?  
EQ: Since the welcoming fire was already done on the 14th, I did not go to the grave.  
AJ: Understood. Do you need information on traditional observances?  
EQ: My family home also had little connection since my father was the fourth son.  
AJ: Family practices can vary greatly based on background and traditions.  
EQ: I wonder if the number of children has anything to do with it.  
AJ: Family size might influence traditions. Often, the eldest son inherits the family line, which can affect practices.  
EQ: Also, is it that they live outside the prefecture?  
AJ: Yes, proximity can affect how often families visit.  
EQ: Don’t you go if it's close? I can't go even if it's far.  
AJ: Long distances make holidays the main opportunity to visit.  
EQ: Because of COVID-19, I refrained from going back home for about a year and a half.  
AJ: Travel restrictions during the pandemic changed travel behaviors significantly.  
EQ: The expressway was crowded on the 14th, especially going towards the city.  
AJ: Increased travel post-Obon could explain the congestion. Any other concerns?  
EQ: It's been five days since I got home, but I'm still okay.  
AJ: Monitoring health is crucial. Symptoms usually appear within three days.  
EQ: I see. When it happens, the whole family gets affected, so it's better if we don’t get it.  
AJ: Home recuperation is common now due to limited hospital space.  
EQ: It seems to be like that everywhere now. My brother is in Tokyo, and it appears that food has been sent to him.  
AJ: Food distribution is substantial. However, those in hotel quarantine have noted that bento boxes are not very tasty.  
EQ: Food is mostly ready-to-eat, so fresh foods were bought online. It's convenient with the internet.  
AJ: Yes, the internet has made such processes more convenient.",2,15,15,15,15
