1,"EQ: Hello!  
AJ: Hello! How can I assist you today?  
EQ: Did you go back to your hometown this year?  
AJ: No, I did not. My parents' house is very close, so I do not particularly need to travel. How about you? Did you go back home for Obon?  
EQ: Yes, I went back to my hometown this year to visit my husband's elderly mother.  
AJ: I see. Did you travel by train or by car?  
EQ: I traveled by car. Since it was from the 14th to the 17th, it was not crowded, which was nice.  
AJ: That sounds like a good time to travel. Did you visit gravesites as well?  
EQ: Since the welcoming fire was already done on the 14th, I did not go to the grave.  
AJ: Understood. Do you need information on traditional observances?  
EQ: My family home also had little connection since my father was the fourth son.  
AJ: Family practices can vary greatly based on background and traditions.  
EQ: I wonder if the number of children has anything to do with it.  
AJ: Family size might influence traditions. Often, the eldest son inherits the family line, which can affect practices.  
EQ: Also, is it that they live outside the prefecture?  
AJ: Yes, proximity can affect how often families visit.  
EQ: Don’t you go if it's close? I can't go even if it's far.  
AJ: Long distances make holidays the main opportunity to visit.  
EQ: Because of COVID-19, I refrained from going back home for about a year and a half.  
AJ: Travel restrictions during the pandemic changed travel behaviors significantly.  
EQ: The expressway was crowded on the 14th, especially going towards the city.  
AJ: Increased travel post-Obon could explain the congestion. Any other concerns?  
EQ: It's been five days since I got home, but I'm still okay.  
AJ: Monitoring health is crucial. Symptoms usually appear within three days.  
EQ: I see. When it happens, the whole family gets affected, so it's better if we don’t get it.  
AJ: Home recuperation is common now due to limited hospital space.  
EQ: It seems to be like that everywhere now. My brother is in Tokyo, and it appears that food has been sent to him.  
AJ: Food distribution is substantial. However, those in hotel quarantine have noted that bento boxes are not very tasty.  
EQ: Food is mostly ready-to-eat, so fresh foods were bought online. It's convenient with the internet.  
AJ: Yes, the internet has made such processes more convenient.",2,15,15,15,15

EQ: That venue is quite large.  
BO: Yes, there were multiple stages, and I walked around all day.

BO: Indeed. I walked over 20,000 steps that day.

BO: Hello.
EQ: Are you experiencing any issues recently?
BO: My body feels heavier.
EQ: Does that mean you've gained weight?
BO: Yes, and I'm moving slower.
EQ: Do you know why?
BO: Probably due to lack of exercise.
EQ: Age sometimes makes me feel sluggish too.
BO: I used to be more active.

BO: That’s convenient.
EQ: Many elderly people go there, and the staff is friendly.
BO: Are the staff women as well?
EQ: Yes, everyone is.
BO: Sounds good. I wish there was one nearby.
EQ: Some gyms offer 30-minute sessions.
BO: There are many gyms, but not women-only ones.
EQ: It might not feel like a gym. It's the right amount of exercise for me.
BO: A hardcore gym might be too much for me.
EQ: I used to overdo it and get tired. This is just right.
BO: Exercising at your own pace is best.
EQ: It's convenient. Only takes an hour in total.
BO: That sounds efficient. I’ll look into it.
EQ: Please do. Exercise improves physical and mental health.
BO: Thank you for the suggestion.",5,15,15,15,15

EV: Puppies are cute.  
EQ: Yes, it was a puppy once, followed me everywhere.

EV: Hello, nice to meet you.
EQ: What drink do you like: coffee or tea?
EV: I drink more tea.
EQ: That's interesting. Which type of tea do you prefer?
EV: Barley tea.
EQ: Barley tea is perfect for summer, isn't it?
EV: Yes, but green tea upsets my stomach, so I can't drink a lot of it.
EQ: I understand. Warm green tea soothes my stomach when I drink it.
EV: Green tea has a diuretic effect, so I can't drink it in large amounts.
EQ: Green tea can help with constipation and warm green tea can prevent dehydration.
EV: I'll keep that in mind for next time.
EQ: I like coffee, but it makes me go to the restroom more frequently.
EV: I can relate. I used to drink coffee during exam periods.
EQ: You've been drinking it since you were young. Did the caffeine help you stay awake?
EV: Not really. It didn't work well for me. Maybe it's just how my body responds.
EQ: So caffeine didn't work as a stimulant for you?
EV: That's correct. I still felt sleepy.
EQ: So you can drink coffee before bed without any issues?
EV: Yes, I think it’s okay for me.
EQ: I wish I could do that. Coffee keeps me up all night.
EV: It affects some people more strongly.
EQ: I also find that it aggravates stomach pain when I have it.
EV: That must be difficult if you enjoy coffee.
EQ: It is. When that happens, I switch to green tea.
EV: I've stopped drinking coffee when I'm sleepy.
EQ: What do you drink instead?
EV: Water. It helps me sleep peacefully.
EQ: Water is universal. That might be a good choice.
EV: I prefer not waking up to use the toilet.",2,15,15,15,15
6,"EQ: Hello!
FW: Hello! How can I assist you today?
EQ: Do you often drink coffee or tea?
FW: Yes, I consume a significant amount. I prefer coffee, but I usually choose decaffeinated.
EQ: Is there a reason for choosing decaf?
FW: My body is sensitive to caffeine, which affects my sleep at night.
EQ: I can relate. I avoid coffee at night for the same reason.
FW: Do you enjoy tea as well?
EQ: Yes, I drink various types, though herbal teas aren't my favorite.
FW: Do you have a specific favorite?
EQ: I think green tea is my favorite. I'm quite fond of it.
FW: Any preference for the type of tea leaves?
EQ: Not really. My father’s family is from Shizuoka, so I've grown up drinking their tea.
FW: That sounds wonderful. I imagine people from Shizuoka have many opportunities to drink tea.
EQ: Yes, it's quite common. I’ve also tried Kukicha.
FW: I’m unfamiliar with Kukicha. Can you describe it?
EQ: It includes the stem part of the tea plant, not just the leaves.
FW: Interesting. Does it taste different?
EQ: It's lighter in flavor but very easy to drink.
FW: That sounds appealing. I recall seeing tea farmers in Shizuoka with very smooth skin.
EQ: Tea is good for beauty, probably due to the vitamins it contains.
FW: I’ve heard it has many vitamins.
EQ: Green tea is also good for my stomach.
FW: Does it help you feel better?
EQ: Yes, when I'm not feeling well, I avoid coffee and drink green tea to warm my stomach.
FW: That sounds beneficial. I usually drink cold brew, but with the colder weather, I will switch to hot tea.
EQ: In the summer, I mostly drink barley tea. Warm tea is more soothing.
FW: Warm tea is indeed comforting.
EQ: I need to buy more soon.
FW: That sounds like a good plan.",4,15,15,15,15

DF: Given its prevalence, infection isn't surprising.
EQ: At hair salons, they tell you not to wear a mask. Why is that?
DF: Masks can interfere, especially during coloring.
EQ: It might get in the way near the ears.
DF: Exactly. Some prefer silent salons if talking isn't comfortable.
EQ: I talk to my hairstylist, but mutual consideration is key.
DF: Speaking of salons, I recently got a short haircut.
EQ: How do you feel about it?
DF: It's much easier now.
EQ: Did something change your mindset?
DF: It's a change of pace.
