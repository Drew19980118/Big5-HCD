2,"DG: Nice to meet you!  
DV: Nice to meet you, hello.  
DG: Have you been into anything lately?  
DV: Watching quiz shows at home!  
DG: Quiz shows are quite popular these days. They seem educational.  
DV: I thought it might be good for brain activation.  
DG: Indeed. Even elementary school problems can be tough.  
DV: I understand! Even though I studied, I don't remember anything at all.  
DG: Exactly! While thinking, ""Did we really learn this?"" they watch.  
DV: I am worried that I might be overtaken by my child soon.  
DG: It must be quite a feeling when you have kids!  
DV: If someone said to me ""You don't even understand this?"", I would be so shocked that I wouldn't be able to sleep.  
DG: I'd feel frustrated too and probably hit the books.  
DV: But we gradually forget things that we don't use regularly, don't we?  
DG: That's right. By the way, what was your favorite subject?  
DV: I liked mathematics.  
DG: Oh! I'm the opposite!  
DV: I liked the part where there is a definitive answer!  
DG: People who like math often say that. It's fair.  
DV: In Japanese language subjects, the answers are ambiguous or vary depending on the grader.  
DG: True. There is that perspective too.  
DV: I feel like there are a lot of ""this isn't wrong either, but..."" situations.  
DG: Yes, I enjoyed reading books and thinking deeply about various things.  
DV: I also used to love reading books! During my student days, I would often spend a lot of time in the library.  
DG: I understand. Recently it has decreased, but I wasn't good at classical literature.  
DV: Classical Japanese was certainly difficult.  
DG: I quickly got bored with kanji drills too. There are many interesting learning materials now.  
DV: There are various types of drills nowadays, aren't there?  
DG: It sounds fun, listening to my friend who has become a mother.  
DV: I need to buy one for the kids soon.",1,15,15,15,15

DV: Hello!  
DG: What time does ""good evening"" start?  
DV: The evening news usually airs around 5 PM or 6 PM.  
DG: I wasn't thinking about it in terms of the news schedule!  
DV: It typically starts around 5 PM.  
DG: I just thought that overseas, people always say ""hello.""  
DV: Japanese can be quite complex.  
DG: Yes, with all its nuances, it can be tough for learners.  
DV: Different ways of speaking can change the impression.  
DG: There are so many homophones, it's overwhelming.  
DV: It can be challenging for non-native speakers to learn Japanese.  
DG: I was glad when I was told my Japanese sounded clear on the phone while I was abroad.  
DV: Have you traveled overseas? Which country did you visit?  
DG: I stayed with a host family in Australia.  
DV: Understood.  
DG: As an only child, having siblings was a new experience.  
DV: Was it a long-term stay or short-term?  
DG: It was during high school, and I experienced severe homesickness.  
DV: Initially, it's fun, but over time, one might start missing home.  
DG: Yes, and the different food made me feel lonely.  
DV: Did you miss rice?  
DG: I started to miss Japanese food, especially fish! There was a lot of meat.  
DV: Is it true that Australia, despite being surrounded by the ocean, has more meat dishes?  
DG: There was a lot of Aussie beef and lamb steak.  
DV: Both are popular and common.  
DG: The lower fat content made me lose weight when I returned!  
DV: It's healthier but can be a bit dry.

DG: Do you attend live concerts?
DV: ""I usually watch DVDs instead.""
DG: That can be more comfortable.
DV: Live concerts can be overwhelming for me.
DG: I understand. Every artist has their unique style.
DV: I went to a female artist’s concert once, and the crowd’s enthusiasm was intense.
DG: Was it the passion of the fans?
DV: Both men and women had incredible enthusiasm.
DG: It sounds like an idol concert. I’m not really into that.
DV: ""I felt out of place, so I prefer watching DVDs.""
DG: I get it. I once attended a Yuzu concert and felt overwhelmed by the energy.
DV: Yuzu’s concerts seem more relaxed.
DG: They’re very skilled, but their energy was surprising!
DV: I wonder if all live performances are like that.
DG: I’d prefer a concert where I can sit and listen calmly.
DV: Yes, I’d like to attend a seated concert too.
DG: Standing for long periods can be tiring. I prefer not to.
DV: ""It’s tough to sit when everyone else is standing.""
DG: True. I feel the same way.

DV: Yes, and there are feeding experiences too.  
DG: I wish I could try that sometime.  
DV: It's definitely memorable.  
DG: I like watching the shark tank to cool off.  
DV: Some sharks are known to be gentle.  
DG: I find hammerhead sharks fascinating with their unique head shape.  
DV: Their square-shaped heads are quite distinctive.  
DG: My friends call me a vacuum cleaner because of that!  
DV: That's an interesting nickname.  
DG: Yes, it's kind of endearing.  
DV: My child likes whale sharks.  
DG: They are big and gentle! I haven't seen one in person.

DG: I've been opting for comfortable shoes lately.

DV: I've also been choosing sneakers more frequently. It's always important to consider the hem.

DG: It can be hard to pick a place on social media.
DV: We eat what the children want, so not many Italian places.
DG: So, it's more likely to be a family restaurant?
DV: Yes, usually family restaurant chains.
DG: I should eat spicy foods while I can.
DV: Conveyor belt sushi is good for kids, but my child doesn't eat sushi.
DG: I see. Preferences and allergies might play a role.
