1,"DM: Good evening.
BP: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
DM: Have you done any shopping recently?
BP: Yes, I recently purchased a neck cooler and have been using it frequently.
DM: What exactly is a neck cooler?
BP: It’s a device you chill and wear around your neck to maintain a comfortable cool sensation. It has become quite popular recently.
DM: Is it similar to a towel made from a special material?
BP: The material is said to be used in space, and the coolant pack inside the ring provides the cooling effect.
DM: This is new to me. I’d like to try it out.
BP: You can purchase one for about 1000 yen on Qoo10.
DM: That’s quite affordable! Is there a limit to how many times it can be used?
BP: It solidifies quickly even in the refrigerator and can be used almost indefinitely. However, it's recommended for indoor use or on the balcony.
DM: That’s impressive. Does it get warm quickly in hot places?
BP: It lasts about 2 hours but is best for moderate cooling. For outdoor activities, I recommend a cooling towel or patch.
DM: I understand. It could help save on electricity costs at home.
BP: It’s useful for times when you’re alone, doing tasks like hanging laundry, and undecided about using the air conditioner.
DM: I live alone, and my recent electricity bill was quite high.
BP: It’s common for the cost to increase by around 1000 yen.
DM: That’s a significant increase. Going out also costs money, doesn’t it?
BP: Yes, you can visit public places like libraries or shopping malls.
DM: True, I went to the shopping mall today, and it was very crowded.
BP: I see. If you drive, there’s gas to consider, and you might end up making purchases.
DM: I often buy things I don’t need when I go out, haha.
BP: I can relate. My money seems to disappear at the mall.
DM: I love books and usually buy one when I visit a bookstore.
BP: I enjoy reading too. Recently, I mostly borrow books from the library.
DM: Libraries are convenient, but it’s hard to borrow popular books.
BP: You can reserve books, but it might take several months before you can borrow them.
DM: It makes you want to read it right away, doesn’t it?
BP: I agree. Thank you for the conversation today.",1
2,"DM: Good evening.
BP: Good evening.
DM: Thanks in advance.
BP: Did you have dinner?
DM: Not yet.
BP: Hungry? Are you okay?
DM: Lunch was late, so I'm fine.
BP: We made zucchini ratatouille.
DM: Summer vegetables are great!
BP: They help prevent fatigue.
DM: Seasonal vegetables taste great.
BP: A pressure cooker makes it quickly.
DM: Does it usually take long?
BP: It needs to simmer.
DM: Got it. I made corn rice.
BP: With a rice cooker?
DM: Yes, using fresh corn.
BP: I'll try it.
DM: Include the core for better flavor.
BP: Understood.
DM: The core's broth enhances the taste.
BP: My kids like corn. Thanks.
DM: What other summer vegetables are common?
BP: Tomatoes, eggplants, okra, bitter melons.
DM: I like tomatoes. How do you eat them?
BP: Fresh and in ratatouille.
DM: Fresh tomatoes are better than canned.
BP: Yes, but vegetables are pricey.
DM: Watch out for summer fatigue.
BP: Be careful. Thanks.",11
3,"DM: Good evening.  
BP: Good evening! How can I assist you today?

DM: Do you like movies?  
BP: Yes, I watch them on platforms like Amazon Prime.

DM: Why don't you go to theaters often?  
BP: I haven't had the chance. The last movies I watched were Aladdin, Frozen 2, and the final of Kaguya-sama.

DM: I watched Aladdin too. How did you find it?  
BP: The visuals were fantastic.

DM: I go to the movies often because there's a theater nearby.  
BP: That sounds convenient. I'm planning to see Tang this summer.

DM: Ninomiya-kun's acting is impressive, isn't it?  
BP: Yes, his performance in ""My Family"" was excellent. I'm excited for this movie too.

DM: Do you have a favorite actor?  
BP: Recently, Shun Oguri and Mikako Tabe.

DM: Shun Oguri is quite popular.  
BP: Yes, I took many pictures at the Izu Taiga Drama Museum.

DM: What's the current Taiga drama about?  
BP: It's about the Kamakura shogunate. Shun Oguri plays Yoshitoki.

DM: Taiga dramas seem informative.  
BP: Yes, I also watch explanation videos on YouTube.

DM: I find it challenging to keep up with many characters.  
BP: This drama features many characters, including the 13 retainers.

DM: I might need those videos too.  
BP: Which recent movie did you enjoy the most?

DM: Kingdom 2 and Jurassic Park were great.  
BP: I watched the first Kingdom. Was the second one as impressive?

DM: Yes, it was best seen in a theater. The impact was incredible.  
BP: I should watch movies like Kingdom in the theater.

DM: I watch action movies in theaters and others at home.  
BP: That makes sense. Have a great day.",10

CN: Hello
DM: What time did you wake up today?
CN: I woke up at 8 o'clock.
DM: You wake up early.
CN: I took a nap after that.
DM: If I take a nap, I find it hard to sleep at night.
CN: Understood. What time did you get up today?
DM: I woke up at 10 o'clock today.
CN: Is that your usual time?
DM: On weekdays, I wake up around 7 o'clock, but I sleep in on my days off.
CN: Holidays do tend to have later wake-up times.
DM: The weather was bad today, so I didn't feel like getting up.
CN: I got up because it was garbage day.
DM: It's good that you remembered. It's inconvenient when you forget.
CN: Since it rained the night before recyclable garbage day, I couldn't put it out ahead of time.
DM: That's responsible. Where I live, some people put out trash without much care.
CN: I wouldn't want to ask them to collect wet cardboard.
DM: I also need to deal with the cardboard that's piling up.
CN: Cardboard does tend to accumulate.
DM: I usually wait until I have enough to bundle and dispose of it all at once.
CN: I understand. It can pile up quickly that way.
DM: I enjoy tying up the cardboard boxes.
CN: I'm not very good at organizing things.
DM: It’s satisfying to do it well, even though it's tricky.
CN: Any tips for doing it well?
DM: Tightening it firmly and doing it frequently helps.
CN: I see. I'll try that next time.
DM: Thank you for chatting with me today.
CN: Thank you.",3

DM: I also used the air conditioner and a circulator.
HJ: What's a circulator?

HJ: How effective was it?

HJ: It's better not to turn the air conditioner on and off too frequently.

HJ: I haven't checked this summer's electricity bill yet.
DM: That can be worrying!
HJ: Yes, I think I used it a lot.
DM: Without air conditioning, it's hard to stay comfortable.
HJ: I agree. I kept it on whenever I was home.
DM: I relied solely on the air conditioner.
HJ: Understandable.",4

HJ: Indeed, there are also many saunas.
DM: Does it get crowded often?
HJ: It's crowded on holidays.
DM: That makes sense. I also go to public baths regularly.
HJ: Is it nearby?
DM: It's within about 1 kilometer!
HJ: That sounds convenient. Do you like saunas?
DM: Actually, I've recently started to enjoy them.
HJ: Saunas are quite popular lately.
DM: I hear there's a boom. My place is always busy.
HJ: I understand. Saunas can be quite crowded.
DM: Is it okay during the COVID-19 pandemic?
HJ: Considering we share the same bath, it's a concern.
DM: It's surprising that it doesn't lead to clusters. Do you often go to the sauna?
HJ: I can go, but not for long durations.
DM: My limit is 10 minutes.
HJ: Even 10 minutes is impressive! I manage about 5 minutes.
DM: Maybe the temperature at my place is lower. Is your metabolism good?
HJ: That might be the reason. I get dizzy quickly.
DM: My friend also collapsed from overexertion, so please be careful.
HJ: That's concerning! I'll be cautious.",1
