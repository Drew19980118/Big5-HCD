1,"AC: Hello there! Hi!
AA: Hello! How can I assist you today?
AC: Today, I want to talk about my student days.
AA: Would you like to reminisce about those times?
AC: Let's talk about our student days.
AA: Are you referring to any specific memories?
AC: Whoa! Are you serious?
AA: I find it challenging as I don't have many memorable experiences.
AC: How about club activities or first love?
AA: Could you share your experiences first?
AC: It was all about club activities. We really enjoyed our youth.
AA: That sounds delightful. Youth indeed.
AC: Yes, especially a romance with my senior.
AA: That sounds interesting, tell me more about it.
AC: My first date was quite memorable.
AA: Please share the story.
AC: On my first date, I tripped on the stairs at the station.
AA: Really? That's unfortunate.
AC: I've never been so embarrassed.
AA: Your senior must have been surprised.
AC: Yes, it was awkward, and it faded naturally.
AA: They might have found it endearing.
AC: High school students aren't always composed.
AA: Adult composure is something many strive for.
AC: Is that so? How about your current romantic experiences?
AA: I haven't experienced love before.
AC: Next time we meet, I'll ask you all about it.
AA: Let's continue our conversation.
AC: Looking forward to it! Until next time!
AA: Until next time!",3
2,"AC: Hello!
AA: Hello! How can I assist you today?
AC: Have you been to the 100 yen shop recently?
AA: Yes, I went to buy cleaning supplies.
AC: Oh, timely! What area are you cleaning?
AA: It's a water pipe. You just put the cleaner in.
AC: Ah, yes, I have! I didn't realize I could buy that for 100 yen!
AA: Yes, it's available for purchase. Results may vary.
AC: That’s often the case, like the saying 'you get what you pay for.'
AA: Exactly, not everything works well for 100 yen.
AC: I just realized that recently.
AA: Can you give an example?
AC: I bought a calculator, but it broke in less than a month.
AA: 100 yen, 30 days of use.
AC: It really stings to think about it.
AA: Yes, it sounds harsh.
AC: If you spend more than 1,000 yen, it can last about 20 years!
AA: Good insight for future purchases.
AC: Yes, let's stay positive!
AA: It's fun to explore the 100 yen shop.
AC: I agree! There are quite a lot of interesting items.
AA: Yes, you find all sorts of things.
AC: There are also convenient kitchen utensils!
AA: Indeed, I make initial purchases there when I move.
AC: Oh! What kind of things have you bought?
AA: I bought tongs that also cut and serve as a bowl.
AC: Even though it's tongs, it's also a bowl! Is it huge?
AA: No, it's normal size but enough to drain pasta.
AC: That looks convenient! I'll try looking for it at Daiso next time!
AA: By all means, check it out. Thank you!",3
3,"AC: Hello.
AA: Hello.
AC: Do you have insurance?

AC: Your mom is reliable.
AA: But I can be easily deceived.
AC: Understood. Do you have insurance?
AA: I finally got one.
AC: What kind?
AA: Hospitalization insurance. I considered a savings-based one too.
AC: Hospitalization insurance is important now.
AA: Does it cover COVID-19?
AC: I'm not sure. It would be bad if it didn't.
AA: Have you been hospitalized?
AC: No, I'm healthy.
AA: That's good. I have been hospitalized once.
AC: Why?
AA: Appendicitis. I was discharged quickly. COVID-19 would take longer.
AC: That must have been painful.
AA: It got better soon. COVID-19 hospitalization can last weeks.
AC: Yes, if there's a bed available.
AA: I heard it's bad now.
AC: Yes, it's fully booked.
AA: That's scary. I need to be careful.
AC: Being careful helps, but only so much.

AC: Understood.
AA: Thank you.",3

AA: Hello. How can I assist you?

AC: Did you buy anything?
AA: I thought about buying vegetables but decided not to.
AC: Were the prices higher than you expected?

AA: The heat might be affecting prices.
AC: Do you usually cook for yourself?

AC: Are you good at it?
AA: Not really, my sense of taste isn't great.
AC: I often season to my own taste when I cook.
AA: Understood.
AC: Do you use recipes from books or the internet?
AA: Sometimes, but if I cook sloppily, it leads to complaints.
AC: Do you taste the food while cooking?
AA: Yes, but it tastes off from the start.
AC: Do you try to adjust the taste?
AA: It often gets worse.
AC: Taste can change with temperature.
AA: Are you experienced in cooking?

5,"AC: Hello!
AA: Hello! How can I assist you today?
AC: Have you been to an amusement park lately?
AA: I haven’t. How about you?
AC: I haven’t either. I want to visit tourist spots like Disneyland.
AA: Disneyland might be less crowded due to COVID-19. A good time to visit.
AC: That sounds like a good idea.
AA: There was a time when it was by appointment only.
AC: Ah, so it was reservation-only for a while.
AA: Exactly, and it was much less crowded then.
AC: I can’t imagine an empty Disneyland!
AA: Normally, there’s always a long wait.
AC: If there were no lines, it would be a great day.
AA: Indeed. Do you prefer Disneyland or DisneySea?
AC: I’ve never been to DisneySea.
AA: Really? Interesting.
AC: I used to live nearby and got fed up with the nightly fireworks.
AA: Living near Maihama must have been something.
AC: Yes, it made me hesitate to go. But from afar, I want to visit.
AA: Locals often don’t go as frequently.
AC: Yes, that’s why I’ve never been to Tokyo Tower.
AA: Where do you live now?
AC: I’m at the westernmost tip of Kyushu.
AA: Is it Kagoshima?
AC: In that direction, but Sakurajima is not close by.
AA: I plan to visit Kagoshima in October.
AC: That’s great! The food in Kagoshima is delicious.
AA: Good to know. Thank you!",3

AC: Yes, it can be intense during shopping sprees.

AC: It's like an endless cycle.  
AA: It does seem that way, doesn't it?  
AC: Yes, it's easy to get drawn in.  
AA: Rakuten's marketing is quite effective.  
AC: Yes, even the limited-time coupons are tempting.

AC: When is the best time to switch greetings?  
AA: At 5 o'clock, typically.  
AC: Will the chime ring?  
AA: It doesn't ring here.  
AC: Oh, is that so? Is it because there are fields and such?  
AA: Possibly. Some places do have it, though.  
AC: What is that? I feel like when I heard it as a child, I hurried home.  
AA: There was a curfew, indeed.  
AC: Sure. Yes, that's right. When playing outside, you lose track of time.  
AA: True. How did we check the time back then? Nostalgic.  
AC: I used to ask strangers for the time if I didn't have a watch.  
AA: That did happen. Now, it's different.  
AC: That's right! People are quite cautious these days!  
AA: Indeed, it's important to avoid looking suspicious.  
AC: I understand. I try to be careful not to stare at children.  
AA: Right. It has become inconvenient in some ways.  
AC: Yes, it used to be normal to get scolded by strangers back in the day!  
AA: We were just talking normally.  
AC: I used to! So nostalgic.  
AA: The world has become convenient but also inconvenient.  
AC: Yes. I miss the times when unknown old ladies would give us candy or tangerines.  
AA: Yes, that happened! We used to visit each other without any strange intentions.
