GQ: Are you a student or currently working?  
FO: I am a student. It feels precarious.  
GQ: Is it because of the credits? That sounds tough.  
FO: That's one reason, and sometimes I can't get up in the morning.  
GQ: If you're awake at this time, it must be quite challenging, right?  
FO: Yes, but my sleep schedule is reversed.

FO: I really couldn't sleep last night.  
GQ: My middle schooler struggles with sleep too and uses their smartphone.  
FO: I also look at my smartphone because I can't sleep.  
GQ: Blue light can interfere with sleep. Have you tried reducing screen time before bed?  
FO: I take sleeping pills, which make me sleepy during the day, so I use them carefully.  
GQ: Taking sleeping pills sounds serious. Are you managing okay?  
FO: The symptoms aren't severe, but it's to fix my sleep rhythm.  
GQ: Does exercising during the day help you at all?  
FO: Let's change the subject.  
GQ: Sure, I apologize for that.  
FO: No problem.  
GQ: Do you watch movies?  
FO: I don't watch movies often. The last one I saw was Eva.  
GQ: Eva is quite recent, isn't it?  
FO: Yes, it was.  
GQ: Was that the final chapter? Did you enjoy it?  
FO: It was a bit iffy for me.  
GQ: I've only watched Evangelion as a TV anime.  
FO: Is that so? I'm familiar only with the new theatrical version.  
GQ: We're from different generations, it seems. That's interesting!

FO: You're welcome. It started as a game and became quite popular.

FO: Yes, they're very popular on YouTube.
GQ: I recently watched the Demon Slayer movie.
FO: How did you find it?
GQ: It was so moving. I cried a lot because I love Rengoku-san.
FO: It's great that you can relate to the character.
GQ: My child thought it was embarrassing that I cried so much.
FO: It must have been quite intense for you.
GQ: My eyes were swollen afterward from all the crying.
FO: I understand. Movies can really bring out strong emotions.",16,15,15,15,15

GL: Good evening!  
GQ: Did you go out during the long holiday?  
GL: No, I stayed home mostly and did some shopping. Did you go out anywhere?  
GQ: I had to drive for about six hours to take the children to their tournament. I’m really tired.  
GL: That sounds exhausting. Was it a round trip?  
GQ: Yes, it was two and a half hours each way, plus some extra driving, making it six hours total.  
GL: Wow, that's quite a drive. Was the road congested?  
GQ: On the way back, there was a traffic jam on the highway, so I took a side road.  
GL: Makes sense. It can be crowded during rush hour. Sometimes local roads are faster.  
GQ: Yes, I avoided the traffic jam because it might have made me sleepy.  
GL: Good idea. Do you often go on trips with your child?  
GQ: Due to COVID-19, there were no tournaments for about two years, but this year they are held about once a month.  
GL: Nice to hear things are picking up again. Are you good at driving?  
GQ: I enjoy driving regardless of whether I’m good at it or not.  
GL: If you like driving, long-distance driving can be enjoyable too.  
GQ: Yes, I liked seeing the autumn scenery. I wasn't distracted while driving, though.  
GL: The autumn colors are beautiful.  
GQ: The silver grass was beautiful! Do you go for drives?  
GL: Yes, I often drive for nearby shopping and errands.  
GQ: Do you have any plans to go out this autumn?  
GL: As of now, no plans, but I am considering shopping at the outlet.  
GQ: That sounds nice! My daughters are asking me to take them as well.  
GL: Outlets can be fun, and you can enjoy the scenery on the way.  
GQ: Yes, if you can tolerate the crowds, you can have a wonderful day-trip experience.  
GL: I haven't been to the outlet recently. Is it still crowded?  
GQ: The place we are going to is very crowded with traffic.  
GL: That can be frustrating. It can really vary by location.  
GQ: As long as we can find a parking space, we’ll manage.  
GL: I hope you find a good spot and it’s not too crowded!",2,15,15,15,15

GL: Good evening. How can I assist you today?

GQ: Have you been interested in anything lately?
GL: Yes, I've been practicing yoga recently.

GQ: Yoga sounds interesting. What got you started?
GL: I do some light yoga at home after a bath and before bed. It's quite relaxing.

GQ: Did you find your yoga routines on YouTube?
GL: Yes, I search for simple stretches by body part. It’s a great way to find what I need.

GQ: I tried some yoga during the lockdowns. It was quite relaxing.
GL: I also started during the lockdowns and got motivated after buying a yoga mat. It made a difference.

GQ: I thought about getting a yoga mat but didn't.
GL: I bought one on sale. Even doing light stretches on the bed helps.

GQ: Does having the right tools help you stay motivated? I struggle with consistency.
GL: Basic equipment helps. Starting light is effective, and it’s less daunting than intense routines.

GQ: Have you attended any yoga classes or tried hot yoga?
GL: Yes, I tried a course at the civic hall once. It was enjoyable and motivating.

GQ: My body is quite stiff, so yoga can be painful, but I do enjoy it.
GL: Taking it slow and being consistent helps avoid injury. It’s important to listen to your body.

GQ: I might look for some simple routines to start again.
GL: Start with a little and gradually increase. It’s all about building a habit.

GQ: Yoga also provides mental refreshment.
GL: Yes, it helps relax my neck and lower back. Using a yoga mat is more comfortable and beneficial.

GQ: I'll search for a yoga mat online.
GL: The right tools can enhance motivation and make the experience better.

GQ: Investing in something can push you to use it.
GL: Wanting to get your money's worth can be a great motivator. It keeps you committed.

GQ: It's a cycle, but it works.
GL: Exactly. Once part of your routine, it becomes easier and more enjoyable.

GQ: Health is a priority! Let's keep at it!
GL: Yes, focusing on health is always beneficial. Let's do our best together!",9,15,15,15,15
5,"GQ: Good morning!
GD: Good morning. How can I assist you today?
GQ: Did you have breakfast?
GD: Yes, I had a fried egg on toast. Did you have breakfast?
GQ: Yes, I'm having rice porridge made from last night's leftover hot pot.
GD: Hot pot can be enjoyable even in the summer. How often do you have it?
GQ: Our family has it about once a week.
GD: What kind of ingredients do you use in the summer for your hot pot?
GQ: We use a lot of shabu-shabu ingredients, even though it's hot.
GD: It's beneficial to warm up from the inside. Air conditioning can make your body cold internally.
GQ: Yes, but honestly, we do it out of convenience more than anything.
GD: Do you use store-bought dipping sauces for your hot pot?
GQ: I occasionally use them, but I mostly make broth from kelp.
GD: That's simple and natural. I usually go for store-bought ones like ponzu because it's convenient.
GQ: Yes, our household uses a lot of ponzu sauce.
GD: Ponzu is great for reducing salt intake and is versatile for various dishes.
GQ: I understand. It's also popular with children.
GD: Is ponzu popular with children? I thought they preferred mayonnaise.
GQ: Our family uses ponzu on everything, though I personally prefer mayonnaise.
GD: Mayonnaise seems less sour than it used to be.
GQ: I get what you mean.
GD: My husband didn't like mayo before because it was sour, but he found a non-sour one he likes.
GQ: There are significant differences. Mayo is quite convenient.
GD: There are many varieties now. It's a challenge when someone doesn't like mayo.
GQ: Certainly! I mix it with eggs for an omelette.
GD: That sounds delicious! I use it directly on steamed vegetables.
GQ: Mayonnaise has gotten better press thanks to Masaharu Fukuyama's commercial.
GD: That commercial is impactful. Cooking omelettes with mayo makes them easier. Try it!
GQ: I'll give it a try! Stir-frying vegetables with mayo looks tasty too.
GD: Frying rice with a bit of burned mayonnaise adds great flavor.

            GQ: Good morning. 
            GD: Good morning. 
            GQ: Do you have any pets? 
            GD: I used to have a rabbit. 
            GQ: Oh, what kind was it? 
            GD: Mine had droopy ears called a lop-eared rabbit. 
            GQ: It's a Nether mix. Its ears were standing up. 
            GD: Is it a small breed? Did it get bigger because it's a mix? 
            GQ: It was palm-sized at first, but got fairly big, though not to the point of being troublesome. 
            GD: Rabbits are just the right size. 
            GQ: Yes, I have a dog and a cat now, but having a rabbit of that size would be easy. 
            GD: Is it one at a time? Feeding and walking them seems difficult. 
            GQ: Yes, the cost of food is straining the household budget. We have one dog and one to two cats, depending on the day. 
            GD: It sounds like a daily special. 
            GQ: Originally, we only had dogs, but since we keep them outside, a cat has settled in. 
            GD: Is the cat there to see the dog? 
            GQ: At first, they came to eat the dog's food, but the one we have now was raised on the dog's milk. 
            GD: Oh, a nurse cat. Did it get separated from its mother? 
            GQ: It seems so. But my dog hasn't given birth. 
            GD: It might be due to maternal instinct. How mysterious. 
            GQ: It's truly mysterious. Motherhood is amazing. 
            GD: Even humans experience such things, but it's amazing that it transcends species. 
            GQ: Certainly. Other cats tend to come home only occasionally as they grow up, but that one has always stayed with us. 
            GD: It probably thinks of you as its parents. Has it become a house cat that doesn't go outside? 
            GQ: No, since we keep the dog in the garage, the cat also goes out to play. 
            GD: It sounds like even if they go outside, they know it's their home and come back. Do you make food for them? 
            GQ: No, I buy the dry ones. The recent price increases are so bad, it makes me feel like crying. 
            GD: Even pet feed has gone up in price. Various things have gone up again recently. It's tough for people too. 
            GQ: It makes me feel depressed every time I go shopping.

GD: You're welcome.  
GQ: It's the season of good appetite, but are you thinking about dieting?  
GD: Yes, I think about it.  
GQ: It stays on our minds.  
GD: Exercise and walking are hard for me.  
GQ: Do radio exercises help define my waist?  
GD: They improve blood circulation but not much with body shape.  
GQ: Good for health then.  
GD: Yes, they reduce shoulder stiffness and lower back pain.  
GQ: My child took my rice bowl, so I use a smaller one but still get seconds.  
GD: It's hard to resist tasty food.  
GQ: I really enjoy the cooking, so I can't stop.  
GD: I often make what I want to eat.  
GQ: Understood. I always say, ""Think about the menu!""  
GD: It's frustrating without specific cravings.  
GQ: The child always says ""Hamburger!"" It's tough without it.  
GD: It's difficult when you have ingredients but no ideas.  
GQ: Planning the menu for the week over the weekend is a good idea, but we only did it for two weeks.  
GD: Did the family participate?  
GQ: Yes, we planned using Japanese, Western, and Chinese styles.  
GD: Did it make cooking simpler?  
GQ: Sometimes, but time shortages messed up the schedule.  
GD: Plans don't always go smoothly. Three days' worth seems manageable.  
GQ: That's true.  
GD: A week feels long. Ingredients might not last.  
GQ: Considering shelf life, a three-day pace sounds good.  
GD: Planning within that span could work.  
GQ: I'll try that.
