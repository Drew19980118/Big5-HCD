1,"CU: Hello!
ED: Hello! How can I assist you today?
CU: This summer was really hot, wasn't it!
ED: Yes, it was indeed very hot. How can I help you with that?
CU: I went to an outdoor music festival last weekend and ended up with heatstroke.
ED: I'm sorry to hear that. Are you okay now?
CU: After being in a place without shade for about five hours, I was struck by a headache and nausea.
ED: That sounds difficult. Are you feeling better now?
CU: Yes, I went to the infirmary by myself and felt better after resting for a while.
ED: I'm glad to hear that. Was the event during the daytime?
CU: Yes, it was an event from morning until night, and I got tired during the day.
ED: I see. The crowd and heat must have been challenging.
CU: Yes, it was such a crowd that you could forget about COVID-19. Did you go somewhere?
ED: At the end of July, I went to Karuizawa.
CU: Karuizawa? I've never been there. Is it a nice place?
ED: I had an image of a summer resort, but it wasn't as cool as expected. The temperature was over 30 degrees.
CU: Even Karuizawa is hot, isn't it? How did you spend your time?
ED: I went for my younger brother's wedding.
CU: I see! Congratulations. Where was the venue?
ED: Thank you. It was at the Stone Church of Hoshino Resorts.
CU: I know that place! It's very beautiful, isn't it?
ED: Yes, it is very beautiful.
CU: Since I used to work in the bridal industry, I assume the food must have been delicious.
ED: Yes, the food was really delicious. It was a great experience.
CU: That's great. I would love to go there someday.
ED: It was hotter than expected, but it was a lovely place full of nature.
CU: Since I live in the Kansai region, it's really difficult for me to go to Karuizawa.
ED: I am also from Kansai. It is easier to access from Tokyo.
CU: So you're from Kansai! It's convenient to get there from Tokyo. I'm jealous.
ED: Yes, I traveled leisurely through Nagoya.",1,15,15,15,15
