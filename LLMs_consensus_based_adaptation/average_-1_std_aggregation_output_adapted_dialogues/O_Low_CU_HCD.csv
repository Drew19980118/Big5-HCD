1,"CU: Hello!
ED: Hello! How can I assist you today?
CU: This summer was really hot, wasn't it!
ED: Yes, it was indeed very hot. How can I help you with that?
CU: I went to an outdoor music festival last weekend and ended up with heatstroke.
ED: I'm sorry to hear that. Are you okay now?
CU: After being in a place without shade for about five hours, I was struck by a headache and nausea.
ED: That sounds difficult. Are you feeling better now?
CU: Yes, I went to the infirmary by myself and felt better after resting for a while.
ED: I'm glad to hear that. Was the event during the daytime?
CU: Yes, it was an event from morning until night, and I got tired during the day.
ED: I see. The crowd and heat must have been challenging.
CU: Yes, it was such a crowd that you could forget about COVID-19. Did you go somewhere?
ED: At the end of July, I went to Karuizawa.
CU: Karuizawa? I've never been there. Is it a nice place?
ED: I had an image of a summer resort, but it wasn't as cool as expected. The temperature was over 30 degrees.
CU: Even Karuizawa is hot, isn't it? How did you spend your time?
ED: I went for my younger brother's wedding.
CU: I see! Congratulations. Where was the venue?
ED: Thank you. It was at the Stone Church of Hoshino Resorts.
CU: I know that place! It's very beautiful, isn't it?
ED: Yes, it is very beautiful.
CU: Since I used to work in the bridal industry, I assume the food must have been delicious.
ED: Yes, the food was really delicious. It was a great experience.
CU: That's great. I would love to go there someday.
ED: It was hotter than expected, but it was a lovely place full of nature.
CU: Since I live in the Kansai region, it's really difficult for me to go to Karuizawa.
ED: I am also from Kansai. It is easier to access from Tokyo.
CU: So you're from Kansai! It's convenient to get there from Tokyo. I'm jealous.
ED: Yes, I traveled leisurely through Nagoya.",1,15,15,15,15
2,"CU: Thank you in advance.
ED: You're welcome! How can I assist you today?
CU: Have you taken up any new hobbies recently?
ED: Yes, I've been into jigsaw puzzles.
CU: That sounds fascinating! Are you working on a big puzzle now?
ED: It's a 1000-piece puzzle, so it's a good challenge.
CU: That really does sound like fun! Do you ever lose track of time while working on it?
ED: Yes, I often forget to eat because I get so absorbed.
CU: Wow, that's quite some dedication! Do you have a collection of completed puzzles at home?
ED: Yes, I do, but I stopped displaying them because of space issues.
CU: What do you do with a completed puzzle then?
ED: Do you do jigsaw puzzles yourself?
CU: I’ve done a few in the past.
ED: I usually break them down and store them. It does feel like a shame sometimes.
CU: Isn't it a bit of a shame to dismantle a finished puzzle?
ED: It is! I only keep and display the ones that really stand out to me.
CU: That makes sense. I might try doing a puzzle again. It sounds so relaxing.
ED: It is, especially in an air-conditioned room. A great way to unwind!
CU: It sounds like a perfect hobby!
ED: Thank you! Have you picked up any new interests recently?
CU: Yes, I've been getting into K-pop groups.
ED: Like BTS?
CU: Yes, but I'm really into TXT right now. I can spend hours watching their videos on YouTube.
ED: They're very popular. My friend loves K-pop too.
CU: It’s trending, and there are so many amazing videos online.
ED: There are even K-pop dance schools now. Kids are getting into it seriously.
CU: Yes, my neighbor's kids go to one. They’re really good!
ED: A friend's child goes too. They dance very well.
CU: That's impressive! They could have a bright future in dancing.
ED: Definitely. Best of luck with your interests too!",7,15,15,15,15

ED: Good evening!  
CU: Do you have any pets?  
ED: No, I don't have any pets. Do you?  
CU: Yes, I have one dog.  
ED: What kind of dog is it?  
CU: It's a breed called Cavalier.  
ED: Is that a rare breed?  
CU: It might be. It's a small to medium-sized dog with floppy ears.  
ED: I looked it up. Is it one of the dogs from 101 Dalmatians?  
CU: It could be. They are gentle and cute, but they shed a lot.  
ED: How old is it?  
CU: It is 6 years old.  
ED: So it's getting older. Dogs are wonderful. I'd like to have one someday.  
CU: What kind of dog do you like?  
ED: Bigger dogs and Shiba Inus.  
CU: I love big dogs too, but they're hard to keep.  
ED: My cousin had a Siberian Husky. It was very cute.  
CU: Huskies are friendly, right?  
ED: Yes, very affectionate despite looking like wolves.  
CU: That's charming.  
ED: They shed a lot in summer, though.  
CU: We have the same problem in July. Does your cousin experience the same?  
ED: Yes, it was tough for the dog because of the heat.  
CU: Yes, the Roomba's dustbin gets full quickly.  
ED: Pets are soothing, though.  
CU: Absolutely. I hope you get one someday.  
ED: I hope so too, but I travel a lot for work.  
CU: That's a tough situation.  
ED: Yes, it's hard to leave them alone.",3,15,15,15,15

DN: Hello. How can I assist you today?

CU: It was a very hot and humid day.

DN: Yes, it is quite hot today.

CU: Did you go out somewhere?

DN: Yes, I was out for work all day.

CU: Good job. Do you work indoors?

DN: Yes, I do. My workplace is air-conditioned and comfortable.

CU: Me too. It's tough to handle this heat.

DN: Do you leave early in the morning for work?

CU: No, I leave at 8 o'clock. It's pretty relaxed.

DN: It's cooler than going out at 9 or 10 o'clock.

CU: Yes, it is. I went to an outdoor festival last week and got heatstroke.

DN: What kind of festival?

CU: A music festival called Summer Sonic. Do you know it?

DN: Is ""Summer Sonic"" an artist?

CU: No, it's an event with many famous artists.

DN: Unknown. What kind of artists perform there?

CU: Do you know Yuri or Motohiro Hata?

DN: No, I don't. But it sounds fun.

CU: Yes, it was fun. But it was too hot.

DN: Did you wear a mask during the event?

CU: Yes, since it was outdoors, we weren't too strict, but we tried our best.

DN: It's very hot. The event wasn't in a dome, right?

CU: No, it was under the blazing sun. Umbrellas were prohibited, so I used a hat.

DN: A sturdy hat is necessary to avoid it falling over.

CU: That's right. Some people actually collapsed. This year is unusually hot.

DN: Yes. Did you stand the entire time to watch the performances?

CU: I only watched the artists I liked. If you get the chance, you should check it out.

DN: Thank you for the recommendation. I will look for it!",3,15,15,15,15
5,"CU: Hello!

DN: Hello. How can I assist you today?

CU: Have you traveled anywhere recently?

DN: I often visit the Kansai region on weekends.

CU: That's interesting! I live in the Kansai region. Where do you usually go?

DN: I often go to Nishinomiya.

CU: Is there a specific reason for visiting Nishinomiya?

DN: I study music and visit my son, who is a university student.

CU: Is your work related to music?

DN: No, I am aiming to be a musician and need good teachers.

CU: That sounds exciting! I enjoy playing the piano as a hobby.

DN: Great. I study the harpsichord.

CU: The harpsichord has a wonderful sound.

DN: Bach's compositions sound nice on it.

CU: Bach's music does suit the harpsichord. Do you have one at home?

DN: Yes. What pieces do you play on the piano?

CU: I’m practicing Chopin and Debussy. Their music is so expressive!

DN: I admire them both.

CU: I recently visited the Yamaha piano factory in Kakegawa.

DN: There are many music-related factories in Shizuoka.

CU: I saw a harpsichord on display and tried it briefly.

DN: Was it a large one?

CU: No, it seemed smaller.

DN: I didn't know Yamaha also displays harpsichords.

CU: Are harpsichords expensive?

DN: Yes, a Kawai harpsichord costs about 2 million yen.

CU: That's as expensive as a grand piano!

DN: Indeed. Each one is unique.

CU: They probably vary a lot in price. Keep practicing!

DN: Thank you. Keep up with your piano practice as well!",4,15,15,15,15
6,"CU: Good evening!

DN: Good evening. How can I assist you tonight?

CU: Have you decided on tonight's dinner plans?

DN: We will be eating out tonight.

CU: Great! Is it just the two of you?

DN: No, my college-aged son is home for the holidays, so the three of us will go out together.

CU: That sounds lovely! Do you know what kind of restaurant you'll be going to?

DN: I'm considering either shabu-shabu or yakiniku.

CU: Nice choices! Young people do love meat.

DN: Yes, they do. I have some preferences, but I want my son to decide.

CU: Are you happy when your son comes home?

DN: Yes, it gives me peace of mind when he's nearby.

CU: I understand. No matter how old a son gets, he always remains a concern for his mother.

DN: That's true. Are your children living with you?

CU: Yes, since they're still in junior high school, we're together. But thinking of the future makes me a bit sad.

DN: I understand. I used to be a strong mother, and now I am trying to show more vulnerability.

CU: You must have been a strong mother! Your sons were very obedient, I assume?

DN: Yes, but that was the issue. Seeing me weak, they felt they had to be strong.

CU: I see. I'm also quite responsible, which might not be ideal.

DN: Mothers are typically more reliable than their sons.

CU: I guess they try to raise strong children, but it can have the opposite effect.

DN: It appears so. A teacher at a boys' school once told them to value their pride.

CU: My mother-in-law says the same thing. Boys have a high sense of pride.

DN: Yes, but real life matters more than pride, though boys don't always agree.

CU: I understand. Boys and girls are quite different.

DN: Yes, very different. I need to show some weakness occasionally.

CU: I see. I'll try to rely on him more since he's been dependable lately.

DN: Yes, but too much weakness can be problematic. A little weakness seems better.

CU: Balancing it is tough. It's a daily trial and error process!

DN: Exactly. I'll continue to do my best!",3,15,15,15,15

BH: Good morning! How can I assist you today?  
CU: What's the weather like there today?  
BH: It’s getting cloudy and might rain soon.  
CU: It's supposed to rain here too. This summer was really hot.  
BH: Yes, it was intense. Did you take any measures to stay cool?  
CU: Yes, I attended an outdoor music festival and made some preparations.  
BH: What kind of preparations?  
CU: Have you heard of the cooling gel developed by NASA that freezes at 28 degrees?  
BH: That sounds interesting. How does it work?  
CU: It becomes a neck wrap and cools effectively.  
BH: How long does it last?  
CU: About an hour and a half.  
BH: That is reasonable. Are cooling towels also an option?  
CU: Yes, but don't they make your clothes wet?  
BH: It depends on how you wrap them. My son's clothes sometimes get soaked.  
CU: Proper wrapping is important. Did you go somewhere with your son?  
BH: Yes, we went to a hospital visit.  
CU: I understand. It's easy to get sweaty even on short trips.  
BH: Yes, I had to change my clothes after shopping.  
CU: Doing laundry daily can be challenging.  
BH: Especially when it suddenly rains while the laundry is out.  
CU: We use a drum-type machine that dries clothes too.  
BH: I use basic drying, but some clothes can't be machine-dried.  
CU: Yes, clothes that wrinkle easily can't be machine-dried.  
BH: My child wears printed clothes, so I avoid machine drying to prevent damage.  
CU: Printed clothes can stick together.  
BH: Yes, but using a drum-type machine has made things easier.  
CU: It's very handy when you're in a hurry.  
BH: However, it doesn't always restore towel fluffiness.",8,15,15,15,15
8,"CU: Hello! 
BH: Hello! 
CU: Do you have any favorite foods or dishes? 
BH: I like spicy food. I also like shrimp, so dishes like shrimp with chili sauce are the best. 
CU: Ebi chili is delicious. I also like spicy food and I'm really into Korean cuisine. 
BH: Is it often made? 
CU: I've been making it quite often recently. 
BH: Please tell me what you are making. 
CU: Samgyeopsal, chijimi, and tteokbokki. Do you know them? 
BH: I also make Korean pancakes sometimes. I use pre-mixed flour. 
CU: I use chijimi flour too. The tteokbokki is from a kit. 
BH: Does such a thing exist? Can it be made easily? 
CU: It's really easy. But it might be too spicy for kids. 
BH: My daughter who loves spicy food might be okay. 
CU: If so, please try it. 
BH: I'll look for it. Is it sold in regular supermarkets? 
CU: They should be available in supermarkets recently. 
BH: That would be helpful. I'm going shopping today, so I'll look for it. 
CU: Samgyeopsal is easy to make and popular with children too. 
BH: Is it just grilling pork? 
CU: Yes, and then make something called samjang, which is like a sweet and spicy miso. 
BH: Is what you are making also being sold? 
CU: They sell it, but if you have gochujang, you can make it with seasonings at home. 
BH: I see. I will look into that as well. 
CU: Wrap the meat with things like seasoned bean sprouts, shredded green onions, and kimchi in lettuce or perilla leaves and eat it. 
BH: I'm getting hungry. I'm in the mood for Korean food, so I might go for that tonight. 
CU: Great! 
BH: However, there is a problem; my son is not good with spicy food. 
CU: The only spicy one is the ssamjang, so it might be a good idea to prepare two types, one without gochujang. 
BH: So it can work without it. Thank you for the valuable information.",3,15,15,15,15
