1,"EK: Good evening!
CN: Good evening!
EK: Do you have any part-time job experience?
CN: Yes, at restaurants and Uniqlo.
EK: Uniqlo? That's great.
CN: The part-time job there was tough, so I quit.
EK: Was it because you had to be constantly moving?
CN: Yes, staff need to walk briskly.
EK: Why can't you walk slowly?
CN: It’s to maintain efficient service.
EK: That sounds challenging.
CN: It’s for ensuring customer satisfaction.
EK: It's hard to engage with staff when they’re always moving.
CN: It keeps the store looking busy and clean.
EK: A moderate pace might be better. I had a similar job once.
CN: Is that why Uniqlo is popular? Any other rules like that?
EK: At a moving company, we had to run while working.
CN: That sounds physically demanding.
EK: It was tough, but good training.
CN: Did it change your body?
EK: Not much, but my muscles got stronger.
CN: How do muscles benefit?
EK: They get stronger with heavy lifting.
CN: Noted.
EK: The muscle pain was intense, but I remember it.
CN: Different perspectives are fascinating.
EK: Exercise releases happiness hormones. Do you have any job interests?
CN: I'd like to work at an art museum. I love paintings.

DK: Do you have a favorite type of store?
EK: Yes, I particularly like electronics retail stores.
DK: Have you purchased anything recently?
EK: No, just browsing for now. How about you?
DK: I bought an LED light last year. It made a noticeable difference.
EK: They're very bright, aren't they? We recently switched ours too.
DK: Yes, they are bright and save energy.
EK: It's convenient, but choosing the right products can be challenging.
DK: Visiting stores and comparing products helps. Do you check different brands?
EK: There are so many types of smartphone charging cables, right?
DK: Indeed, even at 100 yen shops, the variety can be overwhelming.
EK: I went to a 100 yen shop recently and was surprised by how much they've evolved!
DK: Yes, items priced at 200 yen or 300 yen are more common now. Have you found any good deals?

3,"EK: Hello!
DK: Hello!
EK: Nice to meet you! Is there anything you've been into lately?
DK: ""Let's see... I've been watching soccer as a hobby for over 10 years now, mainly through streaming.""
EK: I see! Do you actually do it yourself as well?
DK: I haven't played sports, including during my school days. I'm really more into watching and I like sports other than soccer as well.
EK: ""What kind of things besides soccer, for example?""
DK: Speaking of Winter Olympic sports, I watched curling a lot.
EK: You like team-based games!
DK: Yes, curling is more interesting to watch on TV.
EK: Is it because you can see the video from various angles?
DK: There's also that, and in curling, the players wear microphones and everything they say is broadcasted.
EK: ""That's interesting.""
DK: It’s interesting to understand what the players are thinking. Have you been doing any sports recently?
EK: I mostly train at the gym. I've always liked exercising.
DK: I used to go to the gym and do strength training too, but I have already quit. What kind of routine do you follow?
EK: At one point, I was aiming for muscle hypertrophy and working hard at it, but now I'm aiming for the opposite.
DK: What do you mean by the opposite of that?
EK: ""I focus on functional muscle.""
DK: Is it a practical feeling? What kind of training do you do?
EK: ""I focus on the number of reps rather than the weight for the bench press, and do wire exercises at a lighter weight with faster speed.""
DK: That seems like quite hard training. I have no muscles at all.
EK: ""I place a lot of importance on aerobic exercise! I've lost about 10 kilograms from running a lot, so I feel much better!""
DK: 10 kilos! How long did it take you to lose that much weight?
EK: It was about half a year!
DK: That seems like a healthy amount of weight loss.
EK: I don't want to restrict my diet. I think calories should be burned through exercise!
DK: ""It's wonderful, but it's difficult to keep it up.""
EK: The secret to maintaining it is to do it without putting too much burden on yourself and to take it easy!
DK: I'd like to follow your example! I'm lacking exercise due to COVID. Thank you very much.",2,15,15,15,15

EK: Did you go anywhere this summer?

DQ: I understand. I haven't gone out much either, just for shopping.
