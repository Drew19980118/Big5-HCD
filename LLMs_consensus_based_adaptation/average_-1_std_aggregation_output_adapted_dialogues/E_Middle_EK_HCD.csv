CN: Good evening!
EK: Do you have any part-time job experience?
CN: Yes, at restaurants and Uniqlo.
EK: Uniqlo? That's great.
CN: The part-time job there was tough, so I quit.
EK: Was it because you had to be constantly moving?
CN: Yes, staff need to walk briskly.
EK: Why can't you walk slowly?
CN: It’s to maintain efficient service.
EK: That sounds challenging.
CN: It’s for ensuring customer satisfaction.
EK: It's hard to engage with staff when they’re always moving.
CN: It keeps the store looking busy and clean.
EK: A moderate pace might be better. I had a similar job once.
CN: Is that why Uniqlo is popular? Any other rules like that?
EK: At a moving company, we had to run while working.
CN: That sounds physically demanding.
EK: It was tough, but good training.
CN: Did it change your body?
EK: Not much, but my muscles got stronger.
CN: How do muscles benefit?
EK: They get stronger with heavy lifting.
CN: Noted.
EK: The muscle pain was intense, but I remember it.
CN: Different perspectives are fascinating.
EK: Exercise releases happiness hormones. Do you have any job interests?
CN: I'd like to work at an art museum. I love paintings.
EK: That sounds wonderful. Working around art must be inspiring.

DK: Hello! How can I assist you today?
EK: Nice to meet you! Do you have any plans today?
DK: I'm here to help you. What can I do for you today?
EK: I usually enjoy a relaxing weekend. Do you go out on your days off?
DK: Not often, especially since the pandemic started. How about you?
EK: I like to go out and explore new places.
DK: Where do you usually go?
EK: I enjoy shopping and browsing in stores.
DK: Do you have a favorite type of store?
EK: Yes, I particularly like electronics retail stores.
DK: Have you purchased anything recently?
EK: No, just browsing for now. How about you?
DK: I bought an LED light last year. It made a noticeable difference.
EK: They're very bright, aren't they? We recently switched ours too.
DK: Yes, they are bright and save energy.
EK: It's convenient, but choosing the right products can be challenging.
DK: Visiting stores and comparing products helps. Do you check different brands?
EK: There are so many types of smartphone charging cables, right?
DK: Indeed, even at 100 yen shops, the variety can be overwhelming.
EK: I went to a 100 yen shop recently and was surprised by how much they've evolved!
DK: Yes, items priced at 200 yen or 300 yen are more common now. Have you found any good deals?
EK: Yes, the quality of products has definitely improved.
DK: Online reviews can help identify the best products. Do you check reviews online?
EK: Absolutely, it makes a big difference.
DK: Articles and videos on how to use 100 yen shop items creatively are popular too.
EK: I often watch YouTube reviews before buying something.
DK: Searching for reviews is very useful for making informed decisions.
EK: It's important to choose functional products that last.
DK: Yes, purchasing quality items is essential. Is there anything else you need assistance with today?",17,15,15,15,15
3,"EK: Hello!
DK: Hello!
EK: Nice to meet you! Is there anything you've been into lately?
DK: ""Let's see... I've been watching soccer as a hobby for over 10 years now, mainly through streaming.""
EK: I see! Do you actually do it yourself as well?
DK: I haven't played sports, including during my school days. I'm really more into watching and I like sports other than soccer as well.
EK: ""What kind of things besides soccer, for example?""
DK: Speaking of Winter Olympic sports, I watched curling a lot.
EK: You like team-based games!
DK: Yes, curling is more interesting to watch on TV.
EK: Is it because you can see the video from various angles?
DK: There's also that, and in curling, the players wear microphones and everything they say is broadcasted.
EK: ""That's interesting.""
DK: It’s interesting to understand what the players are thinking. Have you been doing any sports recently?
EK: I mostly train at the gym. I've always liked exercising.
DK: I used to go to the gym and do strength training too, but I have already quit. What kind of routine do you follow?
EK: At one point, I was aiming for muscle hypertrophy and working hard at it, but now I'm aiming for the opposite.
DK: What do you mean by the opposite of that?
EK: ""I focus on functional muscle.""
DK: Is it a practical feeling? What kind of training do you do?
EK: ""I focus on the number of reps rather than the weight for the bench press, and do wire exercises at a lighter weight with faster speed.""
DK: That seems like quite hard training. I have no muscles at all.
EK: ""I place a lot of importance on aerobic exercise! I've lost about 10 kilograms from running a lot, so I feel much better!""
DK: 10 kilos! How long did it take you to lose that much weight?
EK: It was about half a year!
DK: That seems like a healthy amount of weight loss.
EK: I don't want to restrict my diet. I think calories should be burned through exercise!
DK: ""It's wonderful, but it's difficult to keep it up.""
EK: The secret to maintaining it is to do it without putting too much burden on yourself and to take it easy!
DK: I'd like to follow your example! I'm lacking exercise due to COVID. Thank you very much.",2,15,15,15,15

DQ: For draft beer, atmosphere matters too.  
EK: I agree. There are more places serving craft beer now.  
DQ: The price often makes me hesitate.  
EK: Yes, it's expensive. It's a bit risky with unknown brands.  
DQ: Belgian beer or dark beer are okay for me.  
EK: It's my dream to go to Belgium and try Belgian beer.  
DQ: I want to try white beer.  
EK: Yeast beer might taste different locally.

EK: I’ve recently taken an interest in camping.
BO: Camping is enjoyable. It's great to connect with nature.
EK: Have you been camping often?
BO: I used to go camping quite frequently.
EK: I haven’t been since I was a child, but I recently bought a tent and am fully prepared.
BO: That sounds wonderful. Lake Kawaguchi is a recommended spot for camping.
EK: Camping by the lake sounds ideal. You can fish there too.
BO: Yes, it would be a great combination. I might try it next time.
EK: That’s a fantastic idea. There are so many good places, it’s hard to choose.
BO: Solo camping has become quite popular lately. It's a nice way to enjoy some peace and solitude.

BO: I am not sure if I can assemble the tent by myself.
EK: Modern tents are very easy to set up. It's a lot simpler than it seems.
BO: That’s helpful to know. It might be worth considering then.

BO: Hello! How can I assist you today?
EK: Have you already eaten dinner?
BO: Yes, I have. I ate earlier.
EK: What's the menu for tonight?
BO: I had dumplings.
EK: Wow, I haven't had dinner yet.
BO: What are you planning to do today?
EK: Upon hearing gyoza, I suddenly have a strong craving for it now.
BO: Gyoza is delicious, isn't it?
EK: This summer, I've been eating a lot. Can you also eat at the restaurant?
BO: Yes, I do. I also like Osho.
EK: Osho is great, isn't it? I went there the day before yesterday.
BO: Is that so? I often eat the set of Tenshinhan and gyoza there.
EK: It's exactly the same! Doesn't Tianjin rice differ completely depending on the restaurant?
BO: It does vary a lot, but I like the Tianjin rice from Osaka Ohsho.
EK: It’s delicious, isn’t it? I’m completely in the mood for gyoza now.
BO: Maybe you should have dumplings today.
EK: Sadly, I don't have it at home.
BO: That's unfortunate. Maybe you can have it soon.
EK: Yes. What do you think about eating late at night?
BO: If I’m really hungry, I’ll eat. If I can wait, I will.
EK: Of course, we do eat. Some people say it's better not to eat after 6 PM, but that's impossible, right?
BO: It’s not feasible for me either. I usually get home around 8 PM.
EK: That's right. Depending on the day, it can be even later and still fine.
BO: Yes, but if it’s late, I try not to eat too much.
EK: That's important! I need to be careful too.
BO: Yes, it’s good to eat until you’re about 80% full.
EK: Today I'll endure it, and tomorrow I'll go to Osho!
BO: Certainly! Thank you for the conversation.",1,15,15,15,15
