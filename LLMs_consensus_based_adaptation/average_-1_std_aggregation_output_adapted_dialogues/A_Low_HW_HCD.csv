CA: Understood.  
HW: I often have decaf coffee, rooibos tea, or herbal teas.

CA: They pair well together.  
HW: White chocolate might be gentler on my stomach.  
CA: Caffeine can affect the stomach.

EU: Nice to meet you, please take care of me!
HW: It's a perfect day for sports, isn't it? Do you have any sports you're good at?
EU: Actually, I'm clumsy with sports, but I like swimming. How about you?
HW: Swimming, huh! Today is perfect for swimming! I play tennis as a hobby.
EU: Tennis is cool! It's the sport they call the gentleman's game.
HW: Yes, that's right. Skilled people have a gentlemanly form.
EU: It seems too hot to handle in the summer, you might collapse. And it involves hard movements.
HW: It's the kind of temperature today that makes you want to swim in the sea rather than play tennis. Have you gone swimming this year?
EU: About the only thing I did was go to the local public pool with my child. Originally, we had planned to go to the river today.
HW: The public pool looks fun!
EU: Because of the coronavirus situation, it wasn't too crowded, so that was good.
HW: It's great that it wasn't crowded.
EU: A private pool, how enviable!!
HW: When I was a child, there was a time when I arrived at the public pool first thing in the morning and it was almost like having it all to myself. It left an impression on me because it felt different from usual.
EU: Wow! Does ""first thing in the morning"" mean around 8 o'clock?
HW: I think it was probably about that time. After that, I swam with a friend and ate ice cream. Don't you think there are a lot of ice cream vending machines at the public pool?
EU: Oh yes, there's an ice cream vending machine! Cup noodles and such are also really delicious at that time!
HW: You get hungry after swimming, don't you?
EU: Everything I eat is really delicious. Ah, I'm starting to feel like swimming. I'm sorry for talking only about myself.
HW: I like listening to people, so it's okay.
EU: You're so kind. Next time, I'd love to hear more about tennis.
HW: If it's about unusual tennis plays, I can always talk about them!
EU: Rare play! I imagined something like a comic on my own and couldn't help but laugh.
HW: I'm having a good time with my tennis club friends. Could it make for an essay comic? Hahaha.
EU: You're in a club! How serious! Could it be that you're an expert?
HW: This is a beginner's tennis club that often makes funny mistakes. Let's talk again sometime soon!
EU: I also want to join in. Please let me talk with you again!
HW: Yes! Thank you very much!
EU: Thank you very much!",1

HW: It's almost dinnertime!
IM: What's on the menu?

HW: We plan to make paella with a kit from the supermarket.

IM: I usually make seafood pasta with the mix.

HW: Seafood pasta sounds good! What's for dinner tonight?
IM: Leftover curry from yesterday.

HW: Nice! Curry gets better the next day, right?
IM: Yes, and maybe seafood curry would be nice too.

HW: I'll try making seafood curry next time!
IM: I've never made it before and I'm a bit anxious.

HW: It will be fine. Just add the seafood mix at the end.
IM: I'll try. Do you cook often?

HW: I cook daily but only the usual dishes with the ingredients I have.
IM: Impressive.

HW: I cook only when necessary. Do you cook or bake?
IM: I don't cook much but want to try.

HW: I want to try banana bread with bananas and pancake mix.
IM: That sounds simple and tasty.

HW: Yes. I'll make it again when butter prices go down.
IM: Is butter expensive now?

HW: Yes, the cost of living has made ingredients expensive.
IM: I'll buy finished products until it gets cheaper.

HW: I'm watching anime right now. Any recommendations?

HW: Potato chips are good. What flavor?
IM: Lightly salted and limited edition.
HW: Many varieties. I recently had thick-cut ridged chips, delicious.

IM: You're welcome.
HW: It's hot every day, isn't it?
IM: Yes, it is. How are you staying cool?
HW: I was curious about those new cool rings. I've been using a cool towel that gets chilly when wet.
IM: What is a cool ring?
HW: It's made from a material that freezes below 28Â°C and doesn't wet your clothes.
IM: That sounds convenient.
HW: Cool towels wet the neck, but cool rings avoid that issue.
IM: Do you have other concerns about the heat?
HW: Carrying many items during summer travel is common.
IM: Carrying lots of luggage can be inconvenient.
HW: True. But carrying your favorite drink in a bottle is great too.
IM: Do you have any drink recommendations?
HW: I drink jasmine tea or flavored tea powder.
IM: What flavors are available?
HW: Supermarkets have apple and vanilla flavored tea powder.
IM: Noted. Any other preferences for drinks?
HW: Water is healthy. Do you prefer hard or soft water?
IM: I find hard water unpleasant.
HW: Hard water is unsuitable for tea.
IM: It is said to be good for cooking.
HW: I didn't know that.

IM: I have a stray cat.
HW: What color is your cat?
IM: It's milk tea color. Are pets not allowed?
HW: I have a cat allergy, so I can't keep one.

HW: I limit myself to just watching cats on TV shows. Is living with a cat fun?
IM: It's fun, but taking care of pets can be challenging.
HW: What kind of things are difficult?
IM: The biggest difficulty is not being able to travel.
HW: Is traveling still difficult even with water dispensers and automatic feeders?
IM: I didn't know those existed.
