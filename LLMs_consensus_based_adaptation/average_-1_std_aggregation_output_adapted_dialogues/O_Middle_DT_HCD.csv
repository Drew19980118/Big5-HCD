1,"DT: Hello. Nice to meet you.  
CP: Hello, nice to meet you too.  
DT: What were you doing this morning?  
CP: I was just hanging out the laundry.  
DT: It’s so hot today. I don't feel like going out.  
CP: Same here. It's raining too.  
DT: That makes staying in more likely, right?  
CP: Yes, it's quite humid. How's the weather there?  
DT: It’s sunny.  
CP: Where do you live?  
DT: I’m in the Kanto region. How about you?  
CP: Kyushu. Did the typhoon pass by you?  
DT: Yes, it did. Is it raining all day there?  
CP: Yes, on and off. It’s quite strong when it rains.  
DT: I hope it doesn’t last for days.  
CP: Flooding is a concern here.  
DT: Do you live near a river?  
CP: Yes, a large river.  
DT: That is concerning.  
CP: The levees have broken many times in the past.  
DT: That’s scary. There have been a lot of floods lately.  
CP: The weather is strange, isn’t it? Too much heavy rain.  
DT: That’s true. It feels tropical.  
CP: I wish it would rain a little regularly.  
DT: Yes, regular rainfall would be beneficial.  
CP: This year, it didn’t rain much during the rainy season.  
DT: So that’s why it’s raining now.  
CP: Maybe.  
DT: It seems it's going to rain regardless.  
CP: Yes, but there are pros and cons to rain.",4,15,15,15,15
2,"DT: Nice to meet you.  
CP: Nice to meet you! How can I help you today?  
DT: What have you been enjoying doing lately?  
CP: I've been writing a novel recently.  
DT: That's impressive! You write instead of just reading.  
CP: Thank you. It's a personal hobby.  
DT: I'm not very good at writing, so I admire you.  
CP: I appreciate that. Writing is popular now.  
DT: Do you publish what you write?  
CP: Yes, I share it online and enter short story contests.  
DT: That's convenient. A computer makes it easy.  
CP: Yes, 5 to 10-page stories are manageable with effort.  
DT: Even 5 pages seem like a lot to me.  
CP: Some writers produce around 500 pages.  
DT: Really? That's incredible. Have you liked writing for long?  
CP: No, a friend got me started, and it was fun.  
DT: So that was your motivation?  
CP: Yes, my friend writes around 300 pages for big competitions.  
DT: That's ambitious. It could catch a publisher's eye.  
CP: Writing 300 pages is too much for me. Authors are impressive.  
DT: It's fascinating how different you and your friend are.  
CP: We were both ordinary kids who didn't read much.  
DT: It's surprising you write well without reading a lot.  
CP: Yes, but I have always liked picture books.  
DT: Picture books are charming and give a warm feeling.  
CP: The illustrations are soothing.  
DT: I used to like Guri and Gura.  
CP: I love it too! I've often thought about making those pancakes.  
DT: I understand. They're the ideal pancakes, right?  
CP: Yes, I want to try making them someday!",4,15,15,15,15
3,"DT: Hello!  
CP: Hello!  
DT: Every day, it's a hassle to think about dinner. What do you plan to eat today?  
CP: Mapo eggplant.  
DT: That sounds great. Maybe I should try making that.  
CP: Eggplants are in season now.  
DT: I don't buy eggplants often. Is it really their season now?  
CP: Yes, my father grows them.  
DT: That's lucky! Fresh vegetables must taste amazing.  
CP: Yes. Is your parents' home nearby?  
DT: No, it's far. I haven't visited for years.  
CP: That must be tough with COVID-19.  
DT: Yes, many people can't go home.  
CP: How do you travel—Shinkansen or airplane?  
DT: The Shinkansen. Ventilation is a concern.  
CP: Enclosed spaces can be worrying.  
DT: Yes, crowded elevators are uncomfortable too.  
CP: Best to avoid them.  
DT: I hope the pandemic ends soon.  
CP: Understood. Do you video call your family?  
DT: Yes, they love seeing their grandchild.  
CP: That must be nice.  
DT: They suggested not visiting to avoid infection.  
CP: Wise choice.  
DT: Yes. I planned to visit this summer. COVID-19 is frustrating.  
CP: It must be hard.  
DT: We met in May, and the baby has grown a lot since then.  
CP: I hope things improve soon.  
DT: Yes. Let's hope neither of us gets COVID.  
CP: Stay safe.",12,15,15,15,15
4,"DT: Hello.
EM: Hello!
DT: What is your hobby?
EM: Do you work on bikes or cars?
DT: I don't, but it sounds intriguing. Do you focus more on the interior or exterior of the car?
EM: I enjoy fixing up old things and using them.
DT: That's fascinating. How old is your car?
EM: It was first manufactured in 1962. Do you know the Mini Cooper?
DT: Yes, many people drive Coopers.
EM: The BMW one is well-known. Mine is a tin toy made by Rover.
DT: It sounds retro and charming.
EM: Yes. We fix issues quickly to prevent them from happening again.
DT: I'm interested because I like old Fiat cars.
EM: I like the Cinque too. It's easy to tinker with, and I'd love to try it someday.
DT: Are some cars easier to tweak than others?
EM: Yes, cars can be tough for amateurs because you need a crane to access the internal structure.
DT: I understand. Do you drive that Mini Cooper often?
EM: Yes, it's our only car.
DT: Do you go on long trips with it?
EM: Mostly within Tokyo, sometimes to Nagano.
DT: How is the fuel economy?
EM: It's like sprinkling with a ladle. It uses high octane fuel.
DT: As expected. Does it feel special when you drive it?
EM: Yes, it gets about 7 kilometers per liter. I've always wanted it, so it's special to me.
DT: Where can you find such old cars?
EM: I got mine through an auction, but they often appear in used car searches.
DT: You got it at an auction? That must have been pricey!
EM: It was exactly 400,000 yen since it was in decent condition.
DT: It's surprising that you can buy it at that price.
EM: Since it needs repairs, it's almost like scrap iron!",4,15,15,15,15
5,"DT: Please!  
EM: Please!  
DT: What did you eat for lunch today?  
EM: Kama-tama udon.  
DT: I love Kamatama udon too! Do you prefer it cold or hot?  
EM: Warm udon is best, but good udon can be enjoyed cold as well.  
DT: I often eat at Marugame or Hanamaru Udon.  
EM: Have you tried looking for places with more authentic tastes?  
DT: Are there many restaurants with delicious udon?  
EM: Yes, in places like Fukushima, Chichibu, and Kagawa.  
DT: Is authentic udon in Kagawa different?  
EM: It's extremely delicious and inexpensive.  
DT: That sounds amazing! It's the soul food of Kagawa Prefecture, right?  
EM: Yes, and some famous shops are in greenhouses.  
DT: A shop in a greenhouse is unusual.  
EM: Yes, and it adds a unique touch to the experience.  
DT: I'll check it out and visit sometime.  
EM: Sure, there are many places that serve kama-tama udon.  
DT: Does the original version include eggs?  
EM: Yes, and sometimes croquettes.  
DT: Now I'm craving udon.  
EM: Talking about it does that.  
DT: I'm not hungry, but I could eat udon anytime!  
EM: Indeed, it's always easy to eat.  
DT: At night, it’s not going to be kamatama, right?  
EM: I can make kama-tama udon at home.  
DT: Doesn't the warmth depend on the noodle soup base?  
EM: The soup is usually ready-made. How about making yaki udon instead?  
DT: That sounds great! I'll give it a try.  
EM: Let's do that!",6,15,15,15,15
