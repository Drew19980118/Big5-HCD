CP: I was just hanging out the laundry.

CP: Same here. It's raining too.

CP: The weather is strange, isn’t it? Too much heavy rain.  
DT: That’s true. It feels tropical.  
CP: I wish it would rain a little regularly.  
DT: Yes, regular rainfall would be beneficial.  
CP: This year, it didn’t rain much during the rainy season.
