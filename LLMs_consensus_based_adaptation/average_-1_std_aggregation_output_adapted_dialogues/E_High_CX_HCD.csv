1,"CX: Hello. How is the COVID-19 situation over there?
BU: Hello. Are you asking about the infection situation in our area?
CX: Yes, current infection numbers in your area.
BU: I don't watch the news about corona anymore. Nothing changes.
CX: I see. Less stress that way.
BU: Yes, it's always reported, and I don't mind it anymore.
CX: Constant worry can be harmful.
BU: Exactly. I just avoid troubling others if I'm infected.
CX: Right. Taking precautions is important.
BU: Let’s change the subject.
CX: Sure. Any positive news you're interested in?
BU: The Chunichi Dragons won yesterday.
CX: Do you like baseball? I'm a Giants fan.
BU: I support the Chunichi Dragons.
CX: Ohno was impressive yesterday.
BU: It's a shame about the Giants.
CX: The pitching staff struggles.
BU: Hirauchi should improve. I'm cheering for Walker and Nakayama from the Giants.
CX: Yes, if they perform well and Okamoto gets better.
BU: Okamoto was removed from the fourth position. Nakata is doing well.
CX: Okamoto is struggling. Nakata's home run was nice.
BU: Nakata has improved since the Chunichi game.
CX: Hitting a home run off Rydel is impressive.
BU: First home run of the year. Poor battery performance though.
CX: The catcher's lead is a concern.
BU: Commentators criticize Kinotaku's leadership this year.
CX: A strong catcher is crucial.
BU: Even if they can’t hit or lead well, a winning catcher is needed.
CX: Someone like Yakult's Nakamura.
BU: Nakamura is good, though his performance dipped after his jersey number changed.",6
2,"CX: Thank you in advance. Are there any long holidays like the Obon holiday?  
BU: No long holidays like Obon. Anything else you need?  
CX: I see. I don't have anything in particular either.  
BU: Are you off today?  
CX: Yes, I'm currently on a break. I lost my job due to COVID-19, so I have free time now.  
BU: Are you looking for a new job?  
CX: Yes, but I have some time to decide, so I'm taking it slow and doing some studying as well.  
BU: Do you have any specific job preferences?  
CX: Thank you. I am considering my options thoroughly before making any decisions.  
BU: What was your previous job?  
CX: I was a TV assistant director.  
BU: In Tokyo?  
CX: Yes, I worked in Tokyo.  
BU: Did you work for a well-known TV company?  
CX: I worked for a production company, so the name might not be recognizable.  
BU: Who is the most famous person you met?  
CX: I worked with Banana Man, who are quite famous now.  
BU: I enjoy comedians.  
CX: Yes, Banana Man are very kind and funny.

BU: Many talents are like that.  
CX: Mr. Shitara, on the other hand, makes small jokes even during breaks.  
BU: It must be a fun environment to work in.  
CX: Yes, it's very lively and bustling.  
BU: A good atmosphere likely contributes to a good program.  
CX: Absolutely. It was difficult when working on shows where the staff didn’t get along.

BU: Enjoying your work is important. Thank you for sharing!",3
3,"CX: Hello. Do you have any plans for today or tomorrow?

CX: I'm planning to have lunch soon.  
BU: Have you decided what to eat?  
CX: I'm thinking of having pork shabu-shabu.  
BU: That sounds nice!  
CX: It's quite simple, just boiled pork and bean sprouts.  
BU: Do you make the broth from scratch?  
CX: No, I just use hot water.  
BU: I see. When I hear ""shabu-shabu,"" I think of a restaurant dish.  
CX: I think of it as boiling water and adding meat and vegetables.  
BU: That sounds delicious too. Do you use ponzu sauce?  
CX: I use a grated daikon radish sauce.  
BU: Is it mixed with ponzu sauce?  
CX: It doesn't have much of a ponzu flavor.  
BU: It's refreshing and delicious. Do you like grated daikon radish?  
CX: I like it, but I prefer buying it pre-grated.  
BU: It's easier that way. Grilled fish with grated daikon and soy sauce is exceptional.  
CX: It pairs well with fatty fish like Atka mackerel.  
BU: Agreed. Grilled fish with grated daikon and soy sauce is delicious.  
CX: I only have it occasionally at set meal restaurants.  
BU: The fish at those places is good. I'm getting hungry.

CO: How long have you been resting?  
CX: It has already been about two and a half years.  
CO: That’s a long time. What was your previous job?

AT: That must have been uncomfortable. Indoor places are usually cool.
CX: To prevent heatstroke, we basically played inside the indoor building all the time.

CX: This is the fourth time this month, but I'm sure there will be a fifth and sixth time as well.
AT: This is already the fourth time. Have you experienced side effects in the past?
CX: The side effects of the third Moderna shot were tough, so I really don't want to get another one.

CX: I wake up frequently at night.  
AT: That can affect sleep quality.  
CX: Cooler or stable temperature would help.  
AT: Do you have an air conditioner?  
CX: No, I live in Hokkaido.
