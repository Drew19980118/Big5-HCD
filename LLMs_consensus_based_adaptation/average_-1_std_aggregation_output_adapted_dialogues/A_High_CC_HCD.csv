1,"CC: Nice to meet you!
DP: Thank you in advance.
CC: I was wondering what you do when you have time, but I guess you don't have any time, right? Haha.
DP: Since I am on a solo assignment, I have time on weekdays.
CC: I see. Will you spend your time watching videos?
DP: I usually watch videos on YOUTUBE and AMAZON PRIME VIDEO.
CC: I feel the same way.
DP: What kind of things are you watching?
CC: On YouTube, well, it's called Rehack. It's a bit embarrassing to say it, though.
DP: What is that? Please tell me!
CC: It's a program made by Nikkei TV Tokyo, maybe related to politics.
DP: You're not embarrassed at all, are you? Is it a debate-related thing?
CC: No, it's embarrassing to say it since Hiroyuki is here, haha.
DP: Hiroyuki appears everywhere and is often a topic of conversation in our family. My eldest son looks up to him as a mentor.
CC: It's scary to look up to a master, haha.
DP: A cause for concern.
CC: It is a program that makes you feel like you understand a bit more about society.
DP: I'll watch it from now on. I'm looking forward to it.
CC: If there is an opportunity, definitely. I watch anime on Amazon Prime. How about you?
DP: I was watching JOJO until just now.
CC: JOJO! I haven't been following it. Is it the latest series?
DP: No, it's an old one. It takes a lot of effort to watch that. What anime are you watching?
CC: Since it was a hot topic, I recently binge-watched Ya Boy Kongming.
DP: I'm curious about it. Is it interesting?
CC: You can watch it with an empty mind, so it feels good. It's silly and funny.
DP: I want to clear my mind.
CC: If so, please laugh. You can laugh at how silly it is.
DP: Alright, let's watch!!
CC: Please watch the cute Koumei!
DP: Roger. It was fun. Thank you very much.

BL: Nice to meet you.  
CC: Did you do anything that feels like summer?  
BL: Playing with water in the bath.  
CC: Do you have children?  
BL: Yes, I put her in a swimsuit to improve her mood.  
CC: I guess we can't go to the sea or the pool, right?  
BL: This year, we can go, but the pool seems scary.  
CC: Are you afraid of the pool regardless of the coronavirus?  
BL: Due to COVID-19, I have never been to a pool.  
CC: That does sound a bit scary.  
BL: It's good to get used to it while young. I can't swim either.  
CC: I wasn't good at it either. After walking along the beach, I felt like swimming.  
BL: It's amazing if you can swim in the sea!  
CC: But whether I can swim now is uncertain...  
BL: If you could swim before, it should be fine.  
CC: I haven't had the opportunity to swim since becoming an adult.  
BL: It's rare. Even at the sea, most people play on the beach.  
CC: That's true. I haven't ridden a bicycle for about 10 years.  
BL: 10 years is a long time! After a few years, I could ride normally.  
CC: I think I can ride it, but riding on the road makes me nervous.  
BL: It is scary where there are many cars.  
CC: I feel scared when I see a bicycle on the roadway and on the sidewalk.  
BL: Sidewalks separated for bicycles and pedestrians are safer.  
CC: Yes, that's better.  
BL: More separated sidewalks would be reassuring.  
CC: When I got off at Kawasaki Station, I saw many sections for bicycles.  
BL: Regions vary in advancement.  
CC: I think so too.  
BL: I hope more places will improve.",2,15,15,15,15

BL: Hello, nice to meet you too.  
CC: What do you usually do when you have free time?  
BL: I usually check social media.  
CC: Is it something like Instagram?  
BL: I mainly use Twitter.  
CC: Twitter? I also check it sometimes.  
BL: Yes, even though I want to see my acquaintances' tweets, I often see recommended ones.  
CC: Don't you think Twitter's recommendation feature is too frequent?  
BL: Yes, there are many recommendations, often from people I don't know.  
CC: I see a lot of tweets from people I'm not following.  
BL: That's correct. There are many complaints about it.  
CC: I only check Twitter occasionally, so there are a lot of updates piled up.  
BL: Yes, many people update frequently.  
CC: That's true. But I spend more time on Instagram. Do you use Instagram?  
BL: I rarely check Instagram and have to log in again when I do.  
CC: I installed TikTok the other day.  
BL: TikTok has a lot of dancing content.  
CC: I was too young to understand the vibe.  
BL: It seems TikTok might not suit everyone.  
CC: I like dancing, so I thought it might be good, but it was just okay.  
BL: Have you ever danced before?  
CC: Just a little bit when I was a student.  
BL: Dance styles change over time.  
CC: I thought Chocopla, who is also active on TikTok, is a genius.  
BL: Is Chocopla a famous person?  
CC: Do you know the comedians called Chocolate Planet?  
BL: Ah, they are entertainers! It sounds interesting.  
CC: In a TikTok filled with incomprehensible posts, this one was exceptionally nonsensical. Chocopla.  
BL: It seems interesting.  
CC: It was great talking with you!  
BL: Thank you.",2,16,16,16,16

CC: Do you do any exercise?
BR: I haven't been doing much recently. Just walking and doing sit-ups.
CC: Do you go for walks often?
BR: Yes, I used to walk for over an hour a day before it got hot.
CC: Is walking for an hour necessary to see benefits?
BR: Benefits start to show after about 20 minutes.
CC: Really?
BR: Do you do any exercise?
CC: No, but I think walking along the river near my house would be nice.
BR: Is the river close to you? It feels nice to walk by the river.
CC: The strong wind has been a bit concerning lately.
BR: Is the wind strong? Is the river wide?
CC: It’s spacious. The sea is also relatively close.
BR: It seems like the wind is strong there. Our place is more on the mountain side, so the river isn't wide.
CC: Is the current swift then?
BR: No, the currents are calm and soothing to watch.
CC: Watching water flow can be very relaxing.
BR: I agree. Watching from the bridge is nice.
CC: My eyes have been flickering lately.
BR: On sunny days, it is tough without shade on the bridge.
CC: The wind on the bridge is also quite strong, isn’t it?
BR: It's not strong here, so it's alright.
CC: On windy days, the bridge sways.
BR: Really? That seems scary. It's interesting how different it can be upstream and downstream.
CC: I would like to go on an adventure from the uppermost stream to the sea at least once.
BR: River rafting sounds fun.
CC: I saw an advertisement for that experience before. I'm interested.

CH: As a child in the countryside, I slept more.
CC: Is more sleep common in the countryside?

BV: Weekday offs can be very useful.
