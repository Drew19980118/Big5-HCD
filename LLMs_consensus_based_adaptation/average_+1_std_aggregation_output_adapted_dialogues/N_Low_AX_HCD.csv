AX: It was a grandmother.
AN: She should rest at home.
AX: The bar is in Higashi-Mikuni, and the bartender is in her 40s.
AN: Higashi-Mikuni has interesting places.
AX: I went after work. The bartender seemed younger compared to the others.
AN: In that setting, someone in their 40s would seem young.
AX: Yes, it wasn't that vibrant.

AN: Same here. Hoping normal life returns soon.",21
3,"AX: Good evening. Thanks in advance.
BG: Good evening. The equipment from Kamakura Seisakusho is too expensive.
AX: It must be heavy to carry.
BG: Yes, it could be tiring.
AX: True. I remembered something. May I discuss a different topic?
BG: Go ahead.
AX: Have you interviewed any staff recently?
BG: Not recently, but I have past experiences.
AX: Once, I interviewed someone who made me laugh.
BG: What happened?
AX: She was 27. I asked about her most enjoyable job.
BG: So you were the interviewer?
AX: Yes. Guess what she said?
BG: What was it?
AX: Being a shrine maiden.
BG: A shrine maiden? That's unexpected.
AX: Yes, and something odd happened.
BG: What happened?
AX: Snot was dripping from her nose to her mouth.
BG: Was it hay fever?
AX: Not sure. I didn't ask or look.
BG: Did she notice?
AX: Then, I asked her next job choice. She still said shrine maiden.
BG: Why apply at your brother's company?
AX: Shrine maidens retire at 26.
BG: Interesting. Did she get the job?
AX: I declined, but someone else was hired. I addressed the runny nose issue through the sales department.
BG: Understood.",5
4,"AX: Good evening.
BG: Good evening. Are you afraid of anything?
AX: I try to be careful with my words.
BG: Some people talk about ghosts in summer.
AX: Ghosts? Do you believe in them?
BG: No, but your language is fine.
AX: When I lived in Hakodate, there were influences from nearby Aomori.
BG: Is it job-related?
AX: Yes, a job called Itako. Any concerns?
BG: Itako sounds frightening.
AX: It's better not to be too scared or curious.
BG: It's the darkness after such stories that scares me.
AX: Understood. People in such professions can be unsettling.
BG: Have you interacted with them? Were you alright?
AX: Yes. Some saw things and were scared; their son went to the hospital.
BG: That sounds unfamiliar.
AX: You can prevent it by being mindful of what you see and hear.
BG: What do you mean?
AX: Watching news about Ukraine daily can be depressing.
BG: Yes, it does.
AX: News about rising prices and uncertain futures can also be discouraging.
BG: I stopped watching the news because it made me anxious.
AX: It's important to be cautious about what we consume daily.
BG: Understood. Thanks.
AX: No problem. Information now comes in like push notifications.
BG: Yes, I've started to dislike TV.
AX: I feel the same. Online exposure worries me.
BG: We need to find a balance with online activities.
AX: Absolutely. Staring at screens too much can strain your eyes.
BG: I agree. Using tools like Hazuki Loupe helps.",12
5,"AX: Good evening. How can we start our collaboration?
BG: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
AX: By the way, have we ever discussed AI?
BG: No, we haven't.
AX: Okay. Have you had any direct experience with AI?
BG: No, it's not something I've encountered closely.
AX: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many chatbots started using AI.
BG: Interesting. I've been using inquiry desks frequently.
AX: Yes, you might see ""Do you need any help?"" on websites.
BG: It can be intrusive but sometimes helpful.
AX: It used to be poor in Japanese but has improved a lot.
BG: Still, it can be useless when you need real help.
AX: They might be using a basic version.
BG: Understood. It could be better with reputable companies.
AX: Most reliable ones use IBM's Watson.
BG: ""No doubt if it's Watson!"" You seem well-informed.
AX: Yes. Pepper-kun in Japan uses it.
BG: I've seen it in restaurants.
AX: Exactly, it's powered by Watson.
BG: It must be expensive and complicated to implement.
AX: Proper implementation can cost millions.
BG: That sounds very demanding and intricate.
AX: They start with around 300 units to improve accuracy using machine learning and deep learning.
BG: Got it. It's like a progression system.
AX: Listening and interpreting are like machine learning.
BG: Understood.
AX: Deep learning differentiates between different contexts of ""kiku"" in Japanese.
BG: That's quite specialized.
AX: It uses many binary judgments to understand.
BG: Fascinating. It’s a really interesting field!",2
6,"AX: Good evening. I look forward to working with you today.  
AG: Good evening! I am ready to assist you.  
AX: Speaking of summer, many people prefer to have cold things; how about you?  
AG: Cold things can harm your body, so it is advisable to avoid them.  
AX: Are there many warm things?  
AG: There are options like drinking soup or room-temperature tea.  
AX: I see. So does that mean it doesn't really matter whether it's summer or winter?  
AG: Correct. How about you?  
AX: In the summer, I have cold things and in the winter, I have warm things.  
AG: Do you also eat ice cream?  
AX: I will eat ice cream too. Can't you eat ice cream?  
AG: Despite my advice to reduce cold things, I still want to eat ice cream. It's delicious, isn't it?  
AX: That's right. Speaking of which, the AI Expo is currently being held in the area where I live.  
AG: Does 'Ice Expo' mean it's an event where various kinds of ice cream are gathered?  
AX: That's right. It seems that they have gathered from all over Japan, and it's the first time in three years.  
AG: Impressive! From all over Japan? Are you going there?  
AX: Actually, I went there today.  
AG: How timely! How was it?  
AX: There were things like freshly baked waffle cones with buns and soft serve on top.  
AG: Luxurious! But can you walk around eating ice cream?  
AX: I could only eat one. But there were various other things too.  
AG: When there are many delicious-looking options, it is hard to choose just one!  
AX: That's right. In Yamanashi, they had various fruit sherbet ice creams.  
AG: Yamanashi has delicious fruits like grapes, pears, and peaches.  
AX: There was also one that was entirely covered with mandarin oranges and had whipped ice cream inside.  
AG: That is an unusual and rare ice cream! It seems interesting.  
AX: That's true. There was also something called macaron ice, and women were lining up in long queues for it.  
AG: It is likely popular with women. Maybe it will be sold at convenience stores.  
AX: It’s easy to buy things at a convenience store because it's convenient, isn't it?  
AG: Yes, it is very convenient.",1
7,"AX: Good evening. Thank you in advance.
AG: Good evening! Looking forward to working with you.
AX: Do you like hot drinks?
AG: I prefer warm. How about you?
AX: Either is fine. Do you drink coffee?
AG: Yes, 1 or 2 cups a day.
AX: I see. I recently listened to the CEO of Starbucks Japan.
AG: How did that come about?
AX: I called him at the office. He mentioned 7-Eleven coffee is delicious.
AG: That's impressive, coming from the Starbucks CEO.
AX: He said empathy among staff is up to the individual.
AG: Interesting. Did that resonate with you?
AX: For example, if someone nearby had an accident, the clerk might hand over coffee based on their judgment.
AG: So, they might give a free drink out of empathy?
AX: Yes, voluntarily.
AG: Would you do the same in that position?
AX: They probably talked to them, but I'm unsure if they made coffee. They must have been very empathetic.
AG: I think I would act similarly.
AX: That aligns with Starbucks' values. Sounds good.
AG: It does feel like a natural reaction.
AX: Once at Starbucks, I was impressed by something.
AG: What happened?
AX: A young girl, likely deaf, communicated only in writing as a store clerk.
AG: It's nice to see inclusivity.
AX: She used a menu with illustrations asking to point here.
AG: That’s heartwarming.
AX: The other clerks only helped when needed and left me alone otherwise.
AG: That respect for autonomy probably helps them work comfortably.
AX: As a customer, I felt grateful.
AG: Sounds like a positive atmosphere between customers and staff.",6
8,"AX: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
AG: Good evening! How can I help you?
AX: Have you ever tried shaved ice sold at storefronts during summer?
AG: Yes, I bought some recently because it looked delicious.
AX: Have you eaten it yet?
AG: Yes, it was made from well-known high-quality well water.
AX: That sounds authentic. What kind of shaved ice was it?
AG: The ice was clear, and the syrup was homemade by a cake shop.
AX: A cake shop? That's interesting. There's also a shaved ice shop nearby.
AG: Have you visited it?
AX: Not yet. It's run by a dumpling shop.
AG: A dumpling shop? That's unique.
AX: Yes, and they have various toppings like three-colored dumplings.
AG: Typical for a dumpling shop.
AX: It’s similar to chilled zenzai with shiratama, isn't it?
AG: Does it have red bean paste on it?
AX: No, it doesn’t. There are also fluffy and creamy types now.
AG: That’s probably influenced by Taiwanese shaved ice trends.
AX: Right. Have you tried Taiwanese shaved ice?
AG: I've seen it on TV but haven’t tried it. The mango flavor looks delicious.
AX: The visuals are impressive. They flavor the ice itself.
AG: It keeps the ice fluffy and prevents it from sinking into the syrup. I’d like to try it someday.
AX: Understood. Thanks for the information.
AG: You’re welcome.",15
