GL: What kind of recommendations are you looking for?
GV: ""Spy x Family"" is popular right now.

GV: Yes, in October.

GL: Someone recommended ""Golden Kamuy"" to me.
GV: My sister has it. I'll check it out.
GL: Many people say it's interesting.
GV: For car enthusiasts, ""Initial D"" is a good one.
GL: I watched some. Unique characters.
GV: I like Mazda cars because of it.
GL: Planning to get a manual license?
GV: No, automatic. Not confident with manuals.
GL: Manuals are harder. Automatic is easier.
GV: How is it to drive a manual?
GL: Changing gears is hard. Try it if you like.
GV: Seems difficult. I'll stick to automatic.
GL: Automatic is smoother.
GV: I just need a car for transportation.
GL: It's convenient. Driving on mountain roads can be fun.
GV: I'll practice in the mountains. Worried about car sickness.

2,"GV: Hello. Have you ever donated blood?
GL: Yes, during an internship.
GV: Did you draw the blood yourself?
GL: No, I volunteered in caregiving and blood donation.
GV: How was it?
GL: I donated blood on the last day. I felt fine.
GV: I also donated blood recently.
GL: Many people volunteer and donate blood.
GV: I didn't have any health issues like anemia.
GL: They took 400 mL, but it's manageable.
GV: I learned my blood type during donation.
GL: It can also substitute for a blood test.
GV: I found the test results interesting.
GL: Being health-conscious is important. You can donate regularly.
GV: I'm planning to go again in November.
GL: Blood donation facilities vary.
GV: I donated at a blood donation car. I want to try a proper facility.
GL: The facility I went to was efficient.
GV: I'll look into finding a good facility.
GL: Yes, you should.
GV: What is your blood type?
GL: Type O.
GV: I was also type O, but my Rh factor was positive.
GL: Mine was positive too.
GV: Are there any negative Rh factor people around you?
GL: I haven't heard of any. A girl in my training had anemia and couldn't donate.
GV: Only healthy people can donate.
GL: Yes, people with anemia can't donate blood.
GV: If you draw 400 mL, it's inevitable.
GL: Health is important.",6
3,"GV: Good morning. Ready to start?  
HA: Good morning!  
GV: What grade is your older child in?  
HA: First grade. The younger one is in preschool.  
GV: Understood. Must be busy.  
HA: They get more independent in elementary school.  
GV: Any issues with the younger child?  
HA: Occasional accidents.  
GV: That can be challenging.  
HA: The mattress sometimes gets wet.  
GV: Try using a plastic sheet.  
HA: It could help, but my child moves a lot.  
GV: Noted.  
HA: Yes, we need full coverage on the mattress.  
GV: Is your child using diapers?  
HA: Yes, at night.  
GV: Transition at their own pace.  
HA: I need to be patient.  
GV: Got it.  
HA: Thanks! Do you have children?  
GV: No, I'm a university student.  
HA: Is your university remote?  
GV: Some classes are in person.  
HA: Do you attend?  
GV: I have completed my credits.  
HA: Are you job hunting?  
GV: Finished already. I'm in my fourth year.  
HA: So you have free time?  
GV: Yes, planning to go to driving school.  
HA: Good idea before work starts.",6
4,"GV: Good morning. I look forward to our collaboration.
HA: Thank you for your cooperation today.
GV: Is the PTA challenging?
HA: I haven't done much. Should I be doing something?
GV: Are there no PTAs in current elementary schools?
HA: There is one, but it's organized by grade level like a duty roster.
GV: I'm not very familiar with it.
HA: Work has decreased significantly due to COVID.
GV: That's quite a relief. My mother used to complain a lot about it in the past too.
HA: Outsourcing everything might be ideal now.
GV: I agree.
HA: Some people can't afford it, which might be why it ends up that way.
GV: The government should invest more in education.
HA: Research positions especially need more support.
GV: I've heard it's harder to find a job after getting a PhD. It's unfortunate.
HA: Is that due to an age disadvantage?
GV: That might be the case. There are few environments in Japan where one can use doctoral expertise.
HA: There must be fewer people pursuing doctoral programs then.
GV: Yes, it should be few.
HA: As expected. Are you in the sciences or humanities?
GV: I'm a science major. Many go on to graduate school.
HA: Does a science degree make it easier to find a job? How about graduate school?
GV: There's not a significant difference, but having a master's degree might be advantageous for specialized positions.
HA: Are you looking for a job in your field of study?
GV: It depends on the field. For niche fields, you might have to look at different aspects.
HA: There seem to be few jobs. What's your major?
GV: I'm majoring in mathematics.
HA: Mathematics! What kind of job can you get with it?
GV: I got a job at a company mostly unrelated to mathematics.
HA: Understood.",3
5,"GV: Good morning. Thank you in advance.
HA: Thank you in advance! How can I assist you today?
GV: I've been interested in different hobbies recently. Any recommendations?
HA: I've always liked watching stage performances.
GV: Do you have any suggestions like Takarazuka?
HA: I used to watch Takarazuka frequently.
GV: Did you watch it live at the theater?
HA: Yes, I often visited the Takarazuka Grand Theater in Tokyo.
GV: I don't know much about it, but I'd like to go someday.
HA: I understand. Are you not often into plays?
GV: I haven't really experienced them much.
HA: Are you not particularly interested in art appreciation?
GV: Not usually, but I have some free time now and might visit a museum.
HA: Museums can be quite interesting. There's a wonderful one in Ueno if you're near Tokyo.
GV: I live in Kanagawa, so Ueno is pretty accessible.
HA: That's convenient! Which part of Kanagawa are you in?
GV: Atsugi.
HA: A friend lived in Atsugi. It takes over an hour by train, correct?
GV: Yes, but I’m used to long commutes since my university is far.
HA: That makes sense. The crowded trains must be stressful.
GV: There is some stress, but I've gotten used to it.
HA: Is your university in Tokyo?
GV: Yes, I attend a university in Tokyo.
HA: Do you sometimes explore places with your commuter pass?
GV: Yes, it’s convenient for visiting various places.
HA: I understand. What kind of places do you visit?
GV: Like Machida, for instance.

GV: I usually go to the game center with friends.
HA: Game centers are still around!",1
6,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you.
HA: Nice to meet you too! How can I assist you today?
GV: Any recent happy events?

GV: What's your hobby?
HA: I like a commentator, and I became friends with someone who also likes them.
GV: Did you connect on Twitter?
HA: Yes, we followed each other and got along well.
GV: Is it like a Vtuber?
HA: No, it's a game commentary team.
GV: A team for FPS or something?
HA: No, it's game commentary with four people, including RPGs.
GV: I didn't know that.
HA: It's a unique group dynamic.
GV: What's the name of the team, if you don't mind?
HA: Are you familiar with the men of Naples?
GV: Not really. I'll check it out later.
HA: It's pretty niche.
GV: That sounds pleasant. I understand that feeling.
HA: Do you connect over things you like?
GV: Yes, I often make friends on Twitter.
HA: What prompts it?
GV: My hobby. I meet people who play mahjong.
HA: Do you play with them sometimes?
GV: Yes, I meet them at mahjong parlors.
HA: How did you feel meeting them the first time?
GV: Their online impression often differs from real life.
HA: Can you see aspects of their personality in person?
GV: Yes, some might seem different online but are nice in person.
HA: That must be interesting.",4
7,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you.
HA: Thank you. How can I assist you?
GV: Have you tried anything to get your children to eat vegetables?
HA: I've used snacks as rewards, but it hasn't worked.
GV: That must be difficult. Have you tried different ways of cooking the vegetables?
HA: Stir-frying hasn't helped. They still refuse bean sprouts and cabbage.
GV: Maybe vegetable juice could work?
HA: I haven't tried that yet. I'll give it a try, but dealing with leftovers might be a hassle.
GV: I hope it works. Do you have any specific likes or dislikes?
HA: I've had very few since childhood.
GV: That must have been convenient for your mother.
HA: Yes, she mentioned that.
GV: Did you eat a lot when you were younger?
HA: Yes, but now I'm trying to eat less for my diet.
GV: How much did you eat back then?
HA: About three servings. Now, just one serving.
GV: That's quite a change. 
HA: People in sports clubs tend to eat even more.
GV: Are you careful about your diet now?
HA: Yes, I'm reducing carbs and increasing protein.
GV: What kind of protein?
HA: More meat, like salad chicken.
GV: Is meat okay for a diet?
HA: Yes, but I avoid fatty parts.
GV: Lean meat seems like a good choice.",4
8,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you.
HA: Hello. How can I assist you today?
GV: What did you major in at university?
HA: I majored in theater.
GV: Did you choose that field because you liked theater?
HA: Yes, I have a passion for theater within the Faculty of Letters.
GV: Did you enjoy watching other performances besides Takarazuka?
HA: Yes, I often watched dancing.
GV: What type of dance did you watch?
HA: Ballet and contemporary dance. Are you familiar with contemporary dance?
GV: I've heard of it.
HA: It is currently popular but may not appeal to everyone.
GV: I saw dancers like that on Kohaku Uta Gassen. I don't dislike it.
HA: Are you referring to backup dancers in groups like Nogizaka48?
GV: I'm not sure which artist it was.
HA: Understood. Do you know about Swan Lake?
GV: I know the piece. Was it originally a ballet?
HA: Yes, it was. Did you know there's a male version of it?
GV: I didn't know that.
HA: In that version, the swans are men, and they perform a duet. It's a new trend.
GV: I'd like to see that if I get a chance, although I might not have much time once I start working.
HA: Understandable. There have been fewer performances in Japan due to COVID-19.
GV: Crossing borders is still difficult now, isn't it?
HA: Yes, but there have been some recent changes in restrictions.
GV: I think I've heard about that.
HA: Yes, hopefully, this will allow more performances to resume.
GV: The performers must have faced many challenges since the start of COVID.
HA: Yes, many performances in Japan were canceled.
GV: I hope everything gets back to normal soon.
HA: Agreed. The current situation is challenging.",4
