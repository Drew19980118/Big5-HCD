CX: If you take preventive measures, there's nothing else you can do.  
BU: Let's stop talking about COVID.

BU: Okamoto was removed from the fourth position. Nakata is performing well now.  
CX: Okamoto is having a tough time. Nakata hit a home run yesterday.  
BU: He's improved since the game against Chunichi. Nakata was impressive.  
CX: Hitting a home run off Rydel is no small feat.  
BU: First home run of the year. Amazing. Poor battery performance, though.

CX: A good catcher is important.  
BU: Yes, even if they can't hit or lead well, a winning catcher is needed.  
CX: Someone like Yakult's Nakamura would be ideal.

6,"CX: Hello! Nice to meet you!  
AT: Hello! Nice to meet you too. How can I assist you today?  
CX: Is it hot there today?  
AT: It's humid because a typhoon is approaching.  
CX: I see, it's quite hot and stuffy here too.  
AT: It's been quite hot lately, which is typical for summer.  
CX: I feel like it has been getting hotter and hotter these past few years.  
AT: Some regions have exceeded 40 degrees this year.  
CX: That's right. Actually, I went to Tokyo during that period, and it was extremely hot.  
AT: That must have been difficult, but it's always cool indoors.  
CX: To prevent heatstroke, we basically stayed inside indoor buildings all the time.  
AT: That's a good strategy. In other regions, heat and water damage have also been severe.  
CX: Certainly. In the area where I live, it has been raining heavily this past week.  
AT: Was there any damage to your house?  
CX: Fortunately, there was no damage to the house.  
AT: That's good to hear. My parent's hometown is Gojome Town in Akita Prefecture, and it's been in the news today.  
CX: I see. Are you safe at the moment?  
AT: Yes, it seems to be okay. The weather has been unstable this summer.

AT: It's becoming more widespread again, and there are frequent reports of medical strain.  
CX: They mentioned on the news that emergency transport can't keep up due to COVID-19 and heatstroke, which is scary.  
AT: Indeed. It's concerning that people with other illnesses might not receive timely treatment.  
CX: That's right. It's painful that some cannot get medical care and pass away due to non-COVID reasons.  
AT: COVID-19 has caused various issues, and it's uncertain when it will end.  
CX: Last year I thought it was over after getting the vaccine, but it seems like it will continue for a while.

CX: This is my fourth shot this month, and there might be a fifth and sixth.  
AT: Have you experienced side effects in the past?  
CX: The side effects of the third Moderna shot were tough, so I really don't want another one.  
AT: Understandable. Please take care of your health.",3
