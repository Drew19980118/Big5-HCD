1,"DE: Hello. Nice to meet you.
CR: Hello. How can I assist you today?
DE: What are your hobbies?
CR: I enjoy being active, though I don't have specific hobbies.
DE: Is it some kind of sport? Or is it training or something?
CR: Yes, I engage in training at the gym.
DE: That's cool. I also went to the gym, but I couldn't continue.
CR: It's challenging to maintain without a clear goal.
DE: I understand. I usually just walk my dog.
CR: Walking the dog seems fun. I wish I could experience it.
DE: The summer heat was intense, making me hesitate to go for walks, but it is enjoyable to walk together.
CR: Indeed, weather conditions can vary, impacting outdoor activities.
DE: Yes, the gym isn't affected by the weather, right?
CR: Correct, the environment is consistent all year round.
DE: Do you also use things like running machines?
CR: Yes, I run on the machine for 30 minutes.
DE: That's healthy. I used a machine with an adjustable incline at the gym I used to go to.
CR: Inclines add difficulty quickly.
DE: With an incline, it feels quite strenuous, almost like mountain climbing.
CR: Even walking at an incline can be challenging.
DE: How many hours a day do you train?
CR: I train twice a week for about 2 hours each session.
DE: That's a good, manageable routine. Continuity is key. That's wonderful.
CR: If it's too burdensome, it's easy to quit.
DE: I see. I ended up stopping. Hahaha.
CR: Sometimes continuity happens by chance.
DE: During the pandemic, I did Zumba indoors often.
CR: Did you follow YouTube videos?
DE: Yes. The music helps me keep going.
CR: That sounds enjoyable.",1,15,15,15,15
2,"DE: Hello.
CR: Hello. How can I assist you today?
DE: Are you planning anything for the fall?
CR: I want to go on a trip, but...
DE: That sounds exciting. I'm curious about the COVID-19 situation.
CR: Yes. I hope the situation improves.
DE: Agreed. Do you have any ideas for your destination?
CR: I'm considering Noto.
DE: Was it Noto or Toyama?
CR: Yes. Because I have never been there.
DE: I remember the fish being delicious there, like sweet shrimp and yellowtail. Would you enjoy that?
CR: I see. I would definitely like to eat fish.
DE: Fish from the Sea of Japan are very tasty, aren't they?
CR: Correct. There are many varieties.
DE: What do you think about taking the Hokuriku Shinkansen?
CR: Deciding between the plane and the Shinkansen is tricky.
DE: I understand. I've never taken the Hokuriku Shinkansen; I'd like to try it. Airplanes are quick. What do you think?
CR: I haven't tried it either. Is it not very fast?
DE: It depends on the location of the airport. What are your thoughts?
CR: It's subtle. Really.
DE: If you're considering driving, would renting a car be an option for you?
CR: Renting a car from the airport is convenient, isn't it?
DE: Yes, it allows you to visit various places.
CR: Even small places have interesting spots I want to visit.
DE: That's true. A trip to Hokuriku sounds lovely. Are you planning to visit Kanazawa as well?
CR: If staying for two nights, I would like to include Kanazawa.
DE: It has charming places in the castle town, like Kenrokuen. Do you think that's appealing?
CR: Right. But I've already been to Kanazawa, so what should I do?
DE: I see. Planning the itinerary is part of the fun, isn't it? Let me know if you have any other ideas.
CR: Also, let's hope for a better situation with COVID-19.",4,15,15,15,15
3,"DE: Hello. Please.
CR: Hello.
DE: Do you listen to music?
CR: I just listen to the songs playing on FM.
DE: I see. The radio station J-WAVE is playing here too.
CR: I listen to it on Radiko on my smartphone during my commute.
DE: Yes, Radiko is convenient because you can listen later if you miss it.
CR: It has clearer sound quality than traditional radio waves.
DE: In the past, it used to be noisy. Indeed.
CR: Recently, I was watching TikTok and discovered that EDM is quite interesting.
DE: What is EDM? I'm not familiar with it.
CR: It stands for electronic dance music.
DE: Is it music you dance to in videos?
CR: It's typically for clubs and live shows.
DE: I see. So, you enjoy clubs and live performances via videos?
CR: People go to clubs and dance to this music.
DE: COVID-19 has made it difficult to go to clubs and live events, hasn't it? But some people still go.
CR: Yes, indeed. I'd like to experience it someday.
DE: Before COVID, I went often. It's really fun to dance to the music.
CR: I’ve only been once, and it was not very exciting.
DE: What kind of music genres do you like?
CR: Definitely not enka, haha. The last concert I attended was Lady Gaga's.
DE: Oh, Lady Gaga reminds me of Top Gun. Have you seen it?
CR: I watched it!
DE: I watched it twice!
CR: Twice!! I cried at the end.
DE: From the first intro, I got goosebumps and teared up.
CR: It was a truly impactful scene.

DE: I see. I prefer black coffee.  
CR: What kind of black coffee do you prefer?  
DE: Strong and fruity, like Ethiopian.  
CR: Understood. I don't enjoy black coffee.  
DE: I began liking it after I started working. Sweet things aren't my preference.  
CR: Noted. I've never liked black coffee.  
DE: I enjoy coffee but prefer small amounts or decaf due to caffeine sensitivity.  
CR: Does coffee help you stay awake?  
DE: Yes, I drink it to stay alert at work.  
CR: I drink coffee at work too, but it only affects my mood.  
DE: Perhaps caffeine works differently for different people.  
CR: Could be individual differences.  
DE: Yes, that might be it. Thick matcha in tea ceremony was intense for me.  
CR: I'm considering learning the tea ceremony.  
DE: That's wonderful! The tea ceremony is profound.  
CR: Is a one-day trial course an option?  
DE: Yes, it's a good idea to check the classroom atmosphere first.  
CR: What kind of atmosphere would you recommend?  
DE: A place to enjoy wabi-sabi without unrelated topics like illness.  
CR: Do unrelated topics come up often?  
DE: My previous classroom focused solely on tea ceremony, but the one in Tokyo was different.  
CR: Is that why you quit?  
DE: Yes, it was too different. I didn’t want to quit, but...  
CR: I hope you find another good place.  
DE: I hope you find a good classroom too.  
CR: A classroom with delicious snacks would be nice.",8,15,15,15,15

BG: Writing occasionally can be easier to manage.  
DE: Writing occasionally seems more achievable.  
BG: Reviewing later can provide insights.

BG: Blogging is similar. I now prefer handwriting.  
DE: Do you have specific stationery preferences?  
BG: Various instruments, particularly ballpoint pens.  
DE: I once bought a fountain pen that I rarely use.  
BG: Fountain pens have a distinct feel. I now use ballpoint pens.  
DE: Do you use thin or thick pens?

DE: I'll check it out. Are thin pens useful?  
BG: Yes, for writing thank-you letters.  
DE: Your writing must be clear.

BF: Yes, thank you. How can I assist you today?

DE: Did you have a summer vacation?

BF: I do not take breaks. How about you?

DE: I couldn't go home for the summer because I had to work without any vacation. How did you spend your summer?

BF: That must have been tough. I went on a trip with my family during Obon.

DE: That sounds nice. Where did you go?

BF: Nagano Prefecture.

DE: Is it in the mountains?

BF: Yes, near Yatsugatake. It was cool and comfortable.

DE: I see. Are you familiar with Nagano?

BF: Yes. Have you been to Nagano?

DE: I've been to Kiyosato and climbed Mount Yatsugatake.

BF: Do you enjoy mountain climbing?

DE: Yes, but I haven't climbed in years. I used to climb with family and friends.

BF: I haven't hiked since elementary school.

DE: I felt the same, but my family influenced me to climb.

BF: Family influence is significant. Any memorable mountains?

DE: Yatsugatake was the harshest—cold and windy.

BF: Did you climb it in winter?

DE: It was a winter mountain but during spring or autumn.

BF: Physical strength is necessary for climbing. Any advice?

DE: I haven't decided either. I'm wondering what's in the refrigerator right now.
BF: It can be challenging to plan meals every day, right?
DE: Absolutely! Do you go shopping every day?
BF: No, I do bulk shopping on weekends.
DE: Me too. When the refrigerator is almost empty, I end up making more stir-fries.
BF: Yes, especially on Fridays when supplies run low.
DE: Exactly. When I search for a recipe with a specific ingredient online, it often ends up being a stir-fry.
BF: That's a common outcome. Sometimes buying ready-made food can be easier.
DE: How far is the local supermarket from your house?
BF: There are 4-5 stores within a 10-minute walk, so I have many options.
DE: That's really convenient. You can choose whatever you want.
BF: Yes, it's quite handy. Also, there's a good yakitori restaurant nearby.
DE: That sounds amazing! I'm definitely envious!
BF: I'm planning to get yakitori for dinner today.
DE: Is it takeout? It's great that such options are more available now.
BF: Yes, it's very convenient and a nice change.
DE: It's enjoyable to get the taste without having to dine in.
BF: It can sometimes be more comfortable than eating inside.
DE: Exactly! It's more convenient for lunch too.
BF: Indeed. I'm starting to feel hungry.
DE: Same here. I'm really into the takoyaki from the local supermarket.
BF: That sounds delicious! I might have to try it sometime.
DE: It has a rich broth and a chewy texture that's amazing.
BF: My stomach just growled! Haha.
DE: Haha, I hope you have a delicious dinner!
