AQ: Hi there.  
BE: I bought a printer last week.  
AQ: You didn’t have one before?  
BE: No, I didn’t, but I’ve always wanted one.  
AQ: It must feel great to finally have it.  
BE: Yes, now I can print photos!  
AQ: Are you going to print photos often?  
BE: Yes, that’s why I bought it.  
AQ: Does it print well?  
BE: Yes, the quality is fantastic.  
AQ: Sounds impressive.  
BE: I printed all the photos on my smartphone one after another.  
AQ: Did the ink run out quickly?  
BE: Yes, it’s already out.  
AQ: Ink can run out fast, indeed.  
BE: Ink is surprisingly expensive.  
AQ: Yes, it can be quite costly.  
BE: But I want to keep printing, so I bought a lot of ink.  
AQ: Is it genuine ink?  
BE: Can I use non-genuine ink?  
AQ: Yes, there are also compatible inks available.

AQ: Hello.
BE: Do you have a pet?
AQ: No, I don't have any pets.
BE: I have a cat and a hamster.
AQ: That sounds lively.
BE: I have two cats, but they are always fighting.
AQ: Are they kept indoors?
BE: Yes, they're indoors because it's an apartment.
AQ: That sounds intense.
BE: After the fight, fur often flies around.
AQ: Understood.
BE: They eat each other's hair, it's scary.
AQ: Are they male and female?
BE: Yes, they are.
AQ: Do you think they will get along?
BE: There's no sign of that.
AQ: They might both be aggressive.
BE: I hope they can get along eventually.

BE: That might be scary in its own way.
AQ: Noted.
BE: I hope they become friends in a few years.
AQ: Understood. Do you have one hamster?
BE: I have two hamsters.
AQ: Are they fighting too?

AQ: Hello.
BE: What is your favorite drink?
AQ: It’s milk.
BE: Interesting choice.
AQ: It’s like a child, isn’t it?
BE: It seems healthy.
AQ: I don't drink coffee or sweet juice.
BE: Do you drink milk outside too?
AQ: No, but I might if I go to a hot spring.
BE: The image after a hot spring is milk. Why is that?
AQ: It's unclear, right? The bottle one.
BE: The one in the bottle tastes good, doesn’t it?
AQ: Yes, why does it taste so good?
BE: Since I don't like milk, I prefer fruit milk if I have to drink it.
AQ: Ah, yes, the sweet one.
BE: It is so sweet that it burns my throat.
AQ: Certainly, it's too sweet.
BE: Do you want them to consume sugar?
AQ: Hahaha. What do you usually drink?
BE: Coffee or tea. I don't drink juice.
AQ: Doesn't coffee make you addicted?
BE: Is it a good kind of addiction?
AQ: Yes.
BE: Yes, I drink almost every day.
AQ: That's right. I've heard it helps you relax.
BE: Since the coffee is ground from beans, it has a nice aroma.
AQ: Yeah, I might like the scent.
BE: See you next time!

AQ: Hello.
BE: Do you drink alcohol?
AQ: Do you consume alcohol?
BE: I occasionally drink, so I bought a SodaStream.
AQ: That sounds interesting and stylish!
BE: It's just a hassle to buy sparkling water every time.
AQ: Is it for mixing with alcohol?
BE: Yes, it's a carbonated mix.
AQ: Got it.
BE: Recently, I only use it to mix with vinegar.
AQ: What is ""micho""?

AF: Hello.  
BE: Do you have any pets?  
AF: Yes, I keep fish and insects.  
BE: Fish and insects? Fascinating.  
AF: Insects are for children. I have two tanks: tropical fish and goldfish.  
BE: Is managing them difficult?  
AF: My husband cleans the fish tank.  
BE: Water quality management is important. We used to keep fish too.  
AF: What kind?  
BE: Tropical fish, like guppies.  
AF: Small tropical fish are cute.  
BE: Do you have any big fish now?  
AF: I used to keep piranhas, now only small tropical fish.  
BE: A piranha? Impressive.  
AF: It was a dream of mine.  
BE: What do piranhas eat?  
AF: Bloodworms and carnivorous pellets.  
BE: I thought they ate live organisms.  
AF: I feed them raw fish. Guppies are used as food when they multiply.  
BE: Guppies became food?  
AF: Practical.  
BE: Preparing bait must be a hassle.  
AF: Raw fish might help them grow larger.  
BE: Do you want to grow them bigger?  
AF: Yes, I want them to grow big.

EJ: Hello.  
BE: What’s your favorite drink?  
EJ: Ginger ale.  
BE: Ginger ale is nice.  
EJ: Yes, I had a spicy one with ginger paste at a burger shop.  
BE: How spicy was it?  
EJ: Quite spicy.  
BE: I had something similar at a pancake shop.  
EJ: They often offer craft drinks like cola.  
BE: There are many luxurious drinks available.  
EJ: Yes, not found in regular bottled drinks.  
BE: But that ginger ale was too spicy for me to finish.  
EJ: Some ginger ales are very spicy. Are you sensitive to spicy foods?  
BE: I’m not good with most spicy foods, but I like wasabi.  
EJ: Interesting, you handle wasabi well.  
BE: I'm not good with painful chili peppers though.  
EJ: Chili peppers can be very painful.  
BE: It hurts more when it's hot, doesn’t it?  
EJ: Yes, heat amplifies spiciness. I prefer medium spiciness for curry.  
BE: I also prefer medium spicy curry.  
EJ: Medium spicy is usually the most flavorful.  
BE: If it’s sweet, it feels lacking.  
EJ: True, excessive spiciness often overshadows the actual flavor.  
BE: Some foods really prioritize spiciness over taste.  
EJ: The super spicy trend has influenced marketing strategies like ""Our food is this spicy.""  
BE: I see, I don’t really understand why spicy food is so popular.  
EJ: It's often about the challenge, but moderation is better.  
BE: Consuming very spicy food might cause stomach issues.  
EJ: Overconsumption can lead to discomfort.",11,15,15,15,15

BE: That must have been exciting! Was it a surprise?  
AQ: Yes, it was unplanned. Have you had any surprises lately?  
BE: Just a small one.  
AQ: What was it?

AQ: No, I didn’t know.  
BE: Interesting, right?  
AQ: Is this specific to a certain area?  
BE: Yes, it seems regional. It’s delicious!  
AQ: I thought Napolitan was just pasta.  
BE: In some coffee shops, they serve it on a hot iron plate.  
AQ: That’s interesting.  
BE: These small surprises are fun!  
AQ: Regional variations are intriguing.  
BE: They definitely are! Sometimes dialects come up unexpectedly.  
AQ: In Tokyo, regional expressions can be quite unfamiliar.  
BE: Are you originally from Tokyo?  
AQ: Yes, I am.  
BE: Your language must be quite standard then.  
AQ: Not always, dialects can be confusing.  
BE: It’s tough when you don’t understand them.  
AQ: True, but many dialects are charming.  
BE: My region’s dialect isn’t very cute, so I admire the charming ones.

AQ: Yes, they sometimes spread unexpectedly.",11,15,15,15,15
