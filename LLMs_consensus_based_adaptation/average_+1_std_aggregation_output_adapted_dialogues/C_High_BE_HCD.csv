AQ: Hi there.  
BE: I bought a printer last week.  
AQ: You didn’t have one before?  
BE: No, I didn’t, but I’ve always wanted one.  
AQ: It must feel great to finally have it.  
BE: Yes, now I can print photos!  
AQ: Are you going to print photos often?  
BE: Yes, that’s why I bought it.  
AQ: Does it print well?  
BE: Yes, the quality is fantastic.  
AQ: Sounds impressive.  
BE: I printed all the photos on my smartphone one after another.  
AQ: Did the ink run out quickly?  
BE: Yes, it’s already out.  
AQ: Ink can run out fast, indeed.  
BE: Ink is surprisingly expensive.  
AQ: Yes, it can be quite costly.  
BE: But I want to keep printing, so I bought a lot of ink.  
AQ: Is it genuine ink?  
BE: Can I use non-genuine ink?  
AQ: Yes, there are also compatible inks available.  
BE: I didn’t know that.  
AQ: You can find compatible ink on Rakuten Ichiba.  
BE: I see! It seems cheaper there.  
AQ: Yes, it often costs less than genuine ink.  
BE: That’s helpful information. Thanks!  
AQ: Just keep in mind that durability and print quality might differ.  
BE: I’ll give it a try. Goodbye.  
AQ: Goodbye.",15,15,15,15,15
2,"BE: Hello.
AQ: Hello.
BE: Do you have a pet?
AQ: No, I don't have any pets.
BE: I have a cat and a hamster.
AQ: That sounds lively.
BE: I have two cats, but they are always fighting.
AQ: Are they kept indoors?
BE: Yes, they're indoors because it's an apartment.
AQ: That sounds intense.
BE: After the fight, fur often flies around.
AQ: Understood.
BE: They eat each other's hair, it's scary.
AQ: Are they male and female?
BE: Yes, they are.
AQ: Do you think they will get along?
BE: There's no sign of that.
AQ: They might both be aggressive.
BE: I hope they can get along eventually.
AQ: One day they might become close.
BE: That might be scary in its own way.
AQ: Noted.
BE: I hope they become friends in a few years.
AQ: Understood. Do you have one hamster?
BE: I have two hamsters.
AQ: Are they fighting too?
BE: No, their cages are separate.
AQ: Got it.
BE: They say hamster fights are intense.
AQ: Noted. Let's talk again soon.",3,15,15,15,15
3,"BE: Hello.
AQ: Hello.
BE: What is your favorite drink?
AQ: It’s milk.
BE: Interesting choice.
AQ: It’s like a child, isn’t it?
BE: It seems healthy.
AQ: I don't drink coffee or sweet juice.
BE: Do you drink milk outside too?
AQ: No, but I might if I go to a hot spring.
BE: The image after a hot spring is milk. Why is that?
AQ: It's unclear, right? The bottle one.
BE: The one in the bottle tastes good, doesn’t it?
AQ: Yes, why does it taste so good?
BE: Since I don't like milk, I prefer fruit milk if I have to drink it.
AQ: Ah, yes, the sweet one.
BE: It is so sweet that it burns my throat.
AQ: Certainly, it's too sweet.
BE: Do you want them to consume sugar?
AQ: Hahaha. What do you usually drink?
BE: Coffee or tea. I don't drink juice.
AQ: Doesn't coffee make you addicted?
BE: Is it a good kind of addiction?
AQ: Yes.
BE: Yes, I drink almost every day.
AQ: That's right. I've heard it helps you relax.
BE: Since the coffee is ground from beans, it has a nice aroma.
AQ: Yeah, I might like the scent.
BE: See you next time!
AQ: Goodbye.",1,15,15,15,15
