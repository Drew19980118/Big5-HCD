1,"EC: Hello  
DG: Hello!  
EC: Cooking every day has become a hassle. Any easy dishes you recommend?  
DG: Try somen. You can make different variations.  
EC: What kind of variations?  
DG: Minced meat miso or add tomatoes for Italian style.  
EC: Sounds good! Do you put those directly on somen noodles?  
DG: Yes, just prepare in advance or use store-bought for dan dan noodles.  
EC: That’s helpful! Different flavors will keep it interesting.  
DG: I tried a chijimi recipe from COOKPAD. It was great.  
EC: Do you mix it with flour? What’s the texture like?  
DG: I used chopped boiled somen and potato starch. It’s chewy.  
EC: Chewy sounds nice! I’ll try it next time.  
DG: Add green onions too.  
EC: Green onions are perfect! Thanks, I’ve decided on tomorrow’s dinner.  
DG: You’re welcome. Cookpad is great for new recipes.  
EC: Do you ever miss with Cookpad?  
DG: Sometimes, because I don’t follow measurements closely.  
EC: You manage well. I struggle with choosing right recipes.  
DG: Any specific failures?  
EC: My rice cooker cake with canned peaches was mushy.  
DG: I understand.  
EC: Yes, it was disappointing.  
DG: It may depend on the machine.  
EC: Expectations make it worse when it fails.  
DG: Hard to check progress with a rice cooker, can be disappointing.  
EC: True. Cheesecake with pizza cheese also tasted bad.  
DG: You try many sweets.  
EC: Thank you. I’ll avoid likely failures and aim to succeed.  
DG: Sometimes, it’s better to play it safe.",3
2,"EC: Hello!
DG: Hello!
EC: Do you have any siblings?
DG: No, I am an only child.
EC: I wanted to be an only child when I was little.
DG: How many siblings do you have?
EC: One younger sister. We fought a lot but now get along.
DG: Being an only child can be lonely.
EC: Would you prefer a sister? My sister wanted an older brother.
DG: That's common.
EC: You might feel jealous of your brother's partner.
DG: My friend finds it hard when their sibling is too close.
EC: Too much closeness can affect finding a partner.
DG: They spend a lot of time together, which is concerning.
EC: Understood.
DG: Do you see your sister often?
EC: No, we live far apart. But we use LINE to talk.
DG: Distance can be tough. Communication helps.
EC: Yes, it does! I have a daughter and a son. Their future relationship is uncertain.
DG: Young people often marry later now. Good relationships matter.
EC: I want them to get along. When they fight, I worry they might grow apart.
DG: My friend fought with their sibling but grew closer later.
EC: Surprising. I thought they always got along.
DG: People change as they grow.
EC: True.
DG: If I have kids, I'd like two.
EC: I see. A larger family can be lively if resources allow.
DG: More people add costs, which needs consideration.
EC: Dreaming about the future is exciting! Thank you!
DG: You're welcome!",15
3,"EC: Hello! Nice to meet you. AF: Hello, how can I assist you today? EC: When I was parking, I accidentally hit the car and my mood dropped. AF: I'm sorry to hear that. Could you tell me more about the situation? EC: It was a used car from the beginning, but I'm worried about the repair costs. AF: I understand. Was the damage significant? EC: It's not very big, but even to an amateur, it's clear that the parts are misaligned. AF: I see. Visible damage can be concerning. Are you worried about the parts becoming detached? EC: Yes, that's right. AF: It's a common concern. Can I help you find a nearby repair shop? EC: It's your parent's car, right? Did you get scolded? AF: My parents knew it was me because I was a beginner. EC: Parental intuition is amazing! AF: Indeed, parents can often tell. The damage was significant, with the door mirror hanging down. EC: That must have been quite a sight! If it were a new car, I'd probably turn pale. AF: I was quite anxious at that moment. EC: Certainly, it must have been tough for the parents too. AF: By the way, do you have any plans to go for a drive? EC: I don't have plans to go for a drive. Do you? AF: I am planning a trip during the latter half of the summer vacation. EC: Sounds great! I'm jealous of your trip! AF: I usually stay without meals and explore local restaurants. EC: That sounds like a very enjoyable trip. AF: Yes, it’s cost-effective and enjoyable. EC: I understand! Thank you for today. AF: You're welcome. Have a great day!",1
4,"EC: Hello, thank you for your time today.  
AF: You're welcome. How can I assist you?  
EC: The pandemic is quite concerning.  
AF: Yes, but wearing a mask in the heat is challenging.  
EC: It feels like I'm going to get heatstroke.  
AF: Many people worry about that.  
EC: Without a mask, it's uncomfortable in public, and the summer is tough.  
AF: Fewer people are wearing masks outdoors now.  
EC: In the countryside, many still wear masks due to COVID-19 concerns.  
AF: I've noticed fewer elderly people wearing masks here.  
EC: Things are gradually changing, aren't they?  
AF: Yes, some, including myself, have stopped wearing masks outdoors.  
EC: That should help reduce heatstroke worries.  
AF: It was very hot this year, so I bought a parasol for children.  
EC: Children feel hot too. Do you use a parasol when commuting to school?  
AF: Some classmates do.  
EC: It must be hot when you commute to school.  
AF: It's fine in the morning, but I use a parasol on the way home.  
EC: It's hottest in the afternoon. Using a parasol helps.  
AF: Yes, children's parasols are light and recommended.  
EC: I'll check the store next time!  
AF: It's affordable, less than 2,000 yen.  
EC: That's good! Are you doing anything else to prevent heatstroke?  
AF: I wear a cooling towel around my neck daily.  
EC: I've never used a cooling towel! Doesn't it make your neck wet?  
AF: You wet and wring it out. It dries quickly.  
EC: It sounds cold and nice!  
AF: It's comfortable for adults too, especially when doing housework.  
EC: I learned a lot, thank you very much.  
AF: Thank you for your questions.",3
5,"EC: Hello, nice to meet you! AF: Hello, please. EC: Lately, I've been thinking that I need to clean up the house, but I just can't seem to get started. AF: What kind of places do you want to clean up? EC: They are toys and children's clothes that are no longer used. They are filled with memories, so I can't throw them away. AF: I understand. Have you considered taking photos before disposing of them? EC: Photos! That way it seems like it would be harder to forget. AF: When bringing home works or other items, take a photo with the person holding it. EC: It's a good idea to let the person carry it. Do you also take photos of crafts and works before disposing of them? AF: Yes, and I keep them in an album for easy access. EC: An album for the works, that's amazing! I've been thinking I need to make one too, but I haven't been able to get around to it. AF: To avoid accumulation, place an order online either on the day you take the photos or the next day. EC: I am impressed by the speed of the work! Is it a case of ordering immediately and putting it away as soon as it arrives? AF: Yes, and I secretly dispose of it when it breaks. EC: That's very informative. Have you ever been scolded or saddened for secretly throwing things away? AF: No, the peak for the person seems to be when they created it. EC: Certainly, the peak of crafting is the moment when you finish making it, isn't it? AF: That's right. Sometimes the process of making it is the only fun part. EC: Especially with things like paper clay, right? I also thought about taking a photo and secretly throwing it away. AF: I recommend it for a neat and tidy home. EC: It's important to have a comfortable home, isn't it? Rooms like the children's room are so messy that just entering them can be disheartening. AF: Sometimes, hand them a garbage bag and ask them to throw away things they don't need. EC: It's amazing that they'll throw things away! At our house, both I and the kids say that everything has memories attached, so there's no end to it. AF: I tend to throw things away quite often, so my child might have taken after me. EC: The way of tidying up seems to resemble that of one's parents, doesn't it? My parents also have a hard time throwing things away, so I resemble them in that regard. AF: Speaking of which, my mother was also the type to throw things away. EC: Amazing! Thank you for sharing such a meaningful story. AF: The pleasure was mine, I had fun.",1
6,"EC: Hello, nice to meet you.
AF: Hello. How can I assist you today?
EC: I am thinking that it's about time to buy a new computer. Can you tell me about the specs of your computer?
AF: It runs the latest Windows version.
EC: My devices often freeze or are slow to update. It's frustrating.
AF: I buy cheap used ones.
EC: Where do you usually buy them and what criteria do you use?
AF: I check prices on Rakuten and confirm with my husband.
EC: Your husband must be knowledgeable about computers.
AF: Yes, he handles the technical details.
EC: I have to choose myself since I use it often.
AF: Consulting with the shop might help.
EC: Consulting with the store could reduce mistakes.
AF: Smartphones are high-spec nowadays. It’s hard to choose one.
EC: I'd like to try Google Pixel.
AF: I recently replaced my smartphone.
EC: What kind of smartphone did you switch to?
AF: The latest 5G from Tone Mobile. I’m not familiar with 5G.
EC: I often hear about 5G, but it doesn’t seem significant.
AF: It runs smoother than my previous one.
EC: Since it’s 5G, you'd expect more speed, right?
AF: I just learned 5G affects speed.
EC: I thought it was related, but I’m not sure.
AF: Recent smartphones take good pictures.
EC: My smartphone's zoom function is disappointing.
AF: I use a digital single-lens reflex camera for serious photos.
EC: It makes sense to use them properly.
AF: I can’t keep up with new things.
EC: Same here. Thank you.
AF: Thank you.",5
7,"EC: Hello!  
AF: Hello. How can I assist you today?  
EC: Have you been watching any TV shows or anime recently?  
AF: Yes, I am watching Naruto and Bleach.  
EC: Those are great shows! I want to see them too!  
AF: Are you familiar with them?  
EC: Yes, I’ve read partway through and plan to binge-read it all at once someday.  
AF: Both have long-running anime adaptations.  
EC: I know both have ended in the manga, but is the anime still continuing?  
AF: Naruto has been fully adapted into an anime.  
EC: Got it! Now I want to see it!  
AF: Naruto's main character has a charming growth arc.  
EC: It's interesting to see things from that perspective!  
AF: Watching his growth from a small child to a strong adult is compelling.  
EC: Exactly! Naruto, if I remember correctly, has a sequel, right?  
AF: The sequel is called 'Boruto: Naruto Next Generations'.  
EC: If Naruto were a child, I might see it from a grandmother's perspective!  
AF: Naruto's marriage partner might surprise you.  
EC: I still don't know! It's an unexpected partner!  
AF: Understood. I recently started watching Bleach.  
EC: Bankai is cool, isn't it?  
AF: Jujutsu Kaisen is popular now, but I prefer Bleach.  
EC: I don't know anything about Jujutsu Kaisen. Bleach has standout characters.  
AF: I got hooked on Bleach quickly and want to watch the movies too.  
EC: Oh, there's a movie too! I didn't know that.  
AF: Fukushi-kun and Hana-chan play the lead roles.  
EC: I want to see it! They should show it on Friday Roadshow.  
AF: You can also watch it on Netflix.  
EC: I don't have Netflix. I'll watch it someday! Thank you very much.  
AF: You're welcome. Thank you.  ",2
8,"EC: Good evening!
AF: Good evening!
EC: Do you have your air conditioner cleaned every year? It's expensive, isn't it?
AF: I don't do it every year; it's about once every three years.
EC: Once every three years is fine. The company recommended doing it yearly, and I was unsure.
AF: It's about time, but rather, it's time to replace the air conditioner.
EC: Air conditioners are expensive, aren't they?
AF: I sometimes think that cleaning on my own with a spray I bought is enough.
EC: I've seen a spray at the pharmacy. Does it get pretty clean?
AF: I haven't tried it yet; I'm slightly concerned it might break.
EC: That's right, you're worried about it breaking, aren't you?
AF: Somehow, I'd prefer to do the maintenance myself rather than outsourcing it.
EC: I see. It makes me want to save money.
AF: The more things you can do on your own, the more you can save.
EC: I think so! Are you good at saving money?
AF: I'm not good at saving money in small ways, so instead, I invest.
EC: You're investing, right? Is it through something like NISA?
AF: I am investing in both NISA and iDeCo, but within the limits of my savings and deposits.
EC: That's impressive. What did you study to learn this?
AF: It's from books, and then I learned it while managing it.
EC: You read the book and then put it into practice, right? Aren't you afraid of taking losses?
AF: In actual shopping, there are times when you make mistakes and lose out, right? That's how I feel.
EC: That's an interesting perspective. It makes me feel less worried.
AF: After all, since it's within my own financial means, even if I lose money, it won't be a significant amount.
EC: I see. So it's best to keep it to an amount that you can accept losing.
AF: I think so. And I am overwhelmingly bad at regular shopping and often fail.
EC: I see! Somehow, I'm starting to feel like I want to invest.
AF: I can't easily recommend it, but investing in Rakuten Points has low risk and is easy to start.
EC: I've seen information about investing with Rakuten points! I'll check it out! Thank you very much.
AF: You're welcome. Thank you very much.",1
