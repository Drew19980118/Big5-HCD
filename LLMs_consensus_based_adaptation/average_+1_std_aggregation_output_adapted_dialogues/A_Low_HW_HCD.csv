EU: Tennis is appreciated for its elegance.
HW: Indeed, skilled players have a refined style.
EU: It can be quite challenging in the summer heat.
HW: It’s so hot today that swimming in the sea seems better than tennis. Have you swum this year?
EU: I went to the local pool with my child. We were planning to go to the river today.
HW: The local pool must have been fun.
EU: It wasn’t crowded because of the coronavirus.
HW: It’s nice it wasn’t busy. I like the calmness of a private pool.
EU: A private pool sounds lovely.
HW: As a kid, I once got to the public pool early, and it felt like having it all to myself.
EU: Was that around 8 AM?

EU: Yes, and also cup noodles.
HW: Swimming definitely makes you hungry.
EU: Yes, this conversation is making me want to swim.
HW: Please, go on.
EU: Next time, I’d love to hear more about tennis.

HW: Try banana bread with bananas and pancake mix.
IM: It sounds simple and tasty.
HW: Yes, I'll make it again when butter prices drop.
IM: Is butter expensive now?

HW: Binge-watching is fun. Do you eat anything while watching?
IM: Yes, potato chips.
HW: What flavor do you like?
IM: Lightly salted and limited editions.
HW: I recently tried thick-cut ridged potato chips.

6,"HW: Thank you in advance.
IM: You're welcome.
HW: It's hot every day, isn't it?
IM: Yes. Are you managing the heat?
HW: I use a cool towel that gets cold when moistened with water.
IM: What's a cool ring?
HW: It's a ring that freezes below 28°C and doesn't wet your clothes.
IM: That sounds useful.
HW: Yes, unlike cool towels, they keep the neck area dry.
IM: Wet clothes can be inconvenient. Carrying drinks too.
HW: Summer means carrying more items.
IM: Managing luggage on trains is difficult.
HW: Compact luggage would be ideal. Any favorite drinks?
IM: There are many options.
HW: I like jasmine tea or flavored tea powder. It's unique.
IM: What's flavored tea powder?
HW: Tea powder with apple and vanilla flavor that dissolves in water.
IM: Convenient. I usually drink water now.
HW: Water is healthy. Do you prefer hard or soft water?
IM: I don't like hard water.
HW: Hard water isn't great for tea and feels different.
IM: My mother preferred hard water. We had both types at home.
HW: Some believe hard water has benefits.
IM: Water usage varies by type.
HW: I'll look into it more.
IM: I'll do the same.
HW: Thanks.
IM: Thank you.",23

HW: Do you have a cat? I'm so jealous. What color is your cat?  
IM: It's milk tea color. Are pets not allowed for you?  
HW: I have a cat allergy, so I can't keep one.  
IM: That must be tough.  
HW: I watch cats on TV shows instead. Is living with a cat fun?  
IM: It's fun, but can be challenging too.  
HW: What kind of things are difficult?  
IM: The biggest one is not being able to travel.  
HW: Even with water dispensers and automatic feeders, is traveling still difficult?  
IM: I wasn't aware of those.  
HW: I saw them on sale on Amazon.  
IM: That sounds convenient. I haven't used Amazon much.  
HW: I haven't used it either. Is your cat already big?

HW: Big cats have their own charm compared to kittens.  
IM: Yes, holding a big cat feels different.  
HW: Life with a cat seems fun!  
IM: You can watch cat videos on YouTube too. Do you watch those?  
HW: Sometimes, yes. There are also various cat toys.  
IM: Yes, but they get bored with them quickly.  
HW: That's a problem.  
IM: We have many unused toys at home because of that.  
HW: Thank you for the conversation! Let's talk again!  
IM: Let's do this again.",4

IM: Thank you in advance.
HW: It's hot every day, isn't it?
IM: It’s hot, isn't it? But I like summer, so it's fun!
HW: You like summer, don’t you. Why is summer your favorite season?
IM: It is because it’s fun no matter where you go! The sea is fun, and the mountains are fun too!
HW: Sure. Here is the translated sentence: Indeed. I also love seeing the mountains lush and green in summer. I love how it looks like a picture with the cumulonimbus clouds.
IM: Certainly, the sky is also nice in the summer! It looks picturesque, doesn't it!
HW: I like to travel to summer resorts and mountains, but I haven’t been able to go recently. Have you been on any trips lately?
IM: This year, although I haven't done it yet, I’m planning to return to my hometown for Obon.
HW: That sounds exciting. Is your hometown in the mountains? Or by the sea?
IM: My hometown has a lot of mountains.
HW: I see. Living near the mountains is lovely, isn’t it?
IM: It's nice, isn't it? I want to go back to my hometown and live in the future. Do you have any plans to go somewhere this summer?
HW: I was planning to travel a bit during Obon, but as the COVID-19 infection situation is increasing, I am currently waiting to see how things develop.
IM: It’s increasing again. It’s a bit disappointing that we can’t go out even though it's summer.
HW: That’s right. A lot has changed since the spread of COVID-19 compared to before.
IM: Things have changed, haven't they? I had a recital for my lessons, but it got canceled this year as well.
HW: That’s a shame. What kind of lessons are you taking?
IM: I have been playing the piano since I was a student.
HW: That’s wonderful. How many years have you been doing it?
IM: I have been continuing for nearly 10 years! I have been working hard with the annual recital as my goal, so it is very disappointing that it has been canceled.
HW: You’ve been continuing for 10 years. It’s great to have goals every year.
IM: Thank you very much. Is there anything you are continuing to do?
HW: Sometimes I attend cooking classes. I've been slacking off quite a bit though. Oh dear.
IM: It’s wonderful that you’re attending cooking classes! How long have you been going?
HW: Rather than continuing to attend regularly, I just go occasionally when I remember.
IM: I see. I can't cook, so people who can are amazing.
HW: Thank you very much. Let’s talk again if we have the chance!
IM: Thank you very much!",1
