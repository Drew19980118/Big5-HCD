FO: Good evening.
GQ: Are you studying or working these days?
FO: I'm a student. It's a bit uncertain right now.
GQ: Is the uncertainty related to your credits? That pressure must be really tough.
FO: Yes, and sometimes I just can't wake up in the morning.
GQ: That does sound challenging. How do you manage to attend your classes then?
FO: My sleep schedule is completely reversed.
GQ: Why do you stay up all night?
FO: I just couldn't sleep last night.
GQ: Have you tried reducing your smartphone use before bed? It might help you sleep better.
FO: I do use my smartphone because I can't sleep.
GQ: You know, blue light from screens can keep you awake. Maybe try reading a book instead?
FO: I take sleeping pills, but they make me sleepy during the day.
GQ: That must make it hard to concentrate. Does it affect your daily activities a lot?
FO: They're meant to help fix my sleep cycle, but it's tricky.
GQ: Have you thought about exercising during the day? It might improve your sleep at night.
FO: I'd like to talk about something else, if you don't mind.
GQ: Of course, no problem at all. Let's switch topics.
FO: Thank you.
GQ: Do you watch movies?
FO: Not very often. The last movie I watched was Eva.
GQ: Oh, Eva! That’s pretty recent, isn't it?
FO: Yes, it was.
GQ: Was it the final chapter? What did you think of it?
FO: It was a bit iffy for me.
GQ: I’ve only seen the Evangelion TV series.

FO: It's a game.
GQ: Oh, the game came first. I should stop guessing.
FO: They may mean the YouTube duo with mochi faces.
GQ: Yes, strange voices.
FO: It's popular and useful.
GQ: I watched the Demon Slayer movie.

GL: Good evening! How can I assist you today?
GQ: Did you go out during the long holiday?
GL: I stayed at home and did some shopping. Did you have any outings?
GQ: I drove for about six hours alone to accompany the children's tournament, and I'm exhausted.
GL: That sounds tiring. Was it a round trip?
GQ: Yes, it's two and a half hours one way, five hours round trip, plus a bit of leisurely driving, making it six hours.
GL: Understood. Was there heavy traffic on your way back?
GQ: Yes, there was a traffic jam on the highway, so I took a side road partway.
GL: Rush hour traffic can be quite congested. Sometimes local roads are quicker.
GQ: Yes, I avoided the traffic jam because it seemed like it would make me sleepy.
GL: Got it. Do you often go on expeditions with your child?
GQ: Due to COVID-19, there were no tournaments for about two years, but this year they are being held at a pace of once a month.
GL: I see. Many restrictions have been lifted. Are you good at driving?
GQ: Whether I'm good at it or not, I like it.
GL: That's good! Enjoying driving makes long-distance trips more pleasant.
GQ: Yes, I enjoyed the autumn scenery. I wasn't driving distracted, though.
GL: The autumn scenery must be beautiful. The trees have started to change color.
GQ: The silver grass was beautiful! Do you go for drives?
GL: I often drive for nearby shopping and errands that last about an hour.
GQ: Do you have any plans to go out this autumn?
GL: Currently, I have no plans, but I am considering shopping at the outlet.
GQ: That's nice! My daughters are eager to go shopping too.
GL: Outlet shopping can be fun, and you can enjoy the scenery on the way.
GQ: Yes, if you can just tolerate the crowds, you can have a wonderful day-trip experience.
GL: I haven't been to the outlet recently. Is it still crowded? Last year it wasn't that crowded.
GQ: The place we are going to is usually very crowded with traffic.
GL: Understood. It can indeed be tiring when it's crowded.
GQ: As long as we can secure a parking space, we'll manage somehow.
GL: I hope you find a spot and enjoy your trip!",2,15,15,15,15

GQ: That's interesting.
GL: I practice light yoga at home.
GQ: Do you follow online guides for that?
GL: Yes, I use YouTube videos.
GQ: I tried yoga during the lockdown.
GL: I started then too. A yoga mat helps keep me on track.

GL: I got a cheap one on sale. It helps.
GQ: Do tools help in sticking with the practice?
GL: Yes, having the right tools can help with consistency.
GQ: Have you ever tried HOT yoga classes?
GL: Yes, I went to a class once. It was good.
GQ: My body is stiff, so it's difficult for me.
GL: Go slow to avoid injury and improve flexibility.
GQ: Maybe I'll find a simple routine from NHK.
GL: That's a good idea. Practice at your own pace.
GQ: Yoga helps clear my mind.
GL: Yes, it helps with relaxation.
GQ: I'll look for a yoga mat online.

5,"GQ: Good morning!

GD: Good morning. How can I assist you today?

GQ: Did you have breakfast?

GD: Yes, I had a fried egg on toast. Did you have breakfast?

GQ: Yes, rice porridge from last night’s leftover hot pot.

GD: Do you often have hot pot, even in summer?

GQ: Yes, about once a week.

GD: What ingredients do you use?

GQ: Similar to shabu-shabu ingredients.

GD: Staying warm is good, especially with air conditioning.

GQ: Absolutely, and it's convenient.

GD: Do you use store-bought dipping sauce?

GQ: Occasionally, but we prefer kelp broth.

GD: Do you use ponzu sauce?

GQ: Yes, we use a lot of ponzu.

GD: Ponzu helps reduce salt intake.

GQ: Yes, and the kids enjoy it too.

GD: I thought kids liked mayonnaise more.

GQ: We use ponzu a lot, but I like mayonnaise too.

GD: Didn't mayonnaise used to be more acidic?

GQ: Yes, I think so.

GD: My husband prefers the less sour mayonnaise now.

GQ: There's a noticeable difference. It's versatile.

GD: There are many varieties now, and it's handy.

GQ: Absolutely. I mix it with eggs for omelettes.

GD: Practical. I use it on steamed vegetables.

GQ: Mayo on an omelette makes it easier to cook. Try it!

GD: I will. Stir-frying with mayo adds rich flavor.

GQ: That sounds good. I’ll try it too. Thanks.

GD: You're welcome. Fried rice tastes great with slightly burned mayo.",32,15,15,15,15
6,"GQ: Good morning.  
GD: Good morning.  
GQ: Do you have any pets?  
GD: I used to have a rabbit.  
GQ: I’ve had one too!  
GD: What kind was it? Mine had droopy ears called a lop-eared rabbit.  
GQ: It was a Nether mix. Its ears were standing up.  
GD: It's a small breed, right? Did it get bigger because it's a mix?  
GQ: At first, it was palm-sized, but it got fairly big. However, it wasn't to the point of being troublesome.  
GD: Understood. Rabbits are generally a manageable size.  
GQ: Yes, I currently have a dog and a cat. Would having a rabbit be easier?  
GD: Managing multiple pets can be challenging.  
GQ: Yes, the cost of food is straining our budget. We have one dog and sometimes two cats.  
GD: Noted. That is a significant number of pets.  
GQ: We originally only had dogs, but since we keep them outside, a cat has settled in.  
GD: Was the cat coming for the dog's food?  
GQ: At first, yes, but the one we have now was raised on the dog's milk.  
GD: That's fascinating. Was it separated from its mother?  
GQ: It seems so. But my dog hasn’t given birth.  
GD: Perhaps it acted on maternal instinct. Motherhood is indeed amazing.  
GQ: It’s truly mysterious. Motherhood is amazing, isn’t it?  
GD: Confirmed. Cross-species behaviors are remarkable.  
GQ: Other cats tend to come home occasionally, but that one has always stayed with us.  
GD: It likely sees your dog as a parent. Is it a house cat now?  
GQ: No, since the dog stays in the garage, the cat also goes out to play.  
GD: Does the cat still return home reliably?  
GQ: Yes, but I buy dry food for them. The recent price increases are tough.  
GD: Noted. That must be challenging to manage.  
GQ: It really makes shopping more difficult each time.  
GD: Understood. Price hikes are indeed impactful.",6,15,15,15,15
7,"GQ: Thank you in advance.
GD: You are welcome.
GQ: ""It's the season of good appetite, but are you thinking about dieting?""
GD: Yes, I think about it. I'm above my ideal weight but not very active.
GQ: Understood. Any specific difficulties?
GD: I'm not good at exercising and couldn't keep up with walking.
GQ: Would radio exercises help define my waist?
GD: My body shape hasn't changed, but my blood circulation has improved.
GQ: That sounds like a health benefit.
GD: Yes, my shoulder stiffness and lower back pain have reduced.
GQ: I switched to a smaller bowl but still get seconds.
GD: It's hard to resist freshly cooked rice.
GQ: Agreed. The food tastes so good, I can't stop.
GD: That's understandable. I end up making what I want since I don't get many requests.
GQ: I always ask, ""What's for dinner?""
GD: Finding inspiration is tough.
GQ: My child always asks for ""Hamburger!""
GD: It’s challenging when the fridge is stocked but no ideas come to mind.
GQ: I saw on TV to plan menus weekly with a family meeting, but we only did it for two weeks.
GD: Did you get useful opinions?
GQ: Yes, we planned with Japanese, Western, and Chinese styles.
GD: Did it make cooking easier?
GQ: Sometimes, but scheduling got tricky.
GD: Things don't always go as planned. Planning for three days feels like the limit.
GQ: Exactly, it feels more manageable now.
GD: A week feels too long; ingredients may not stay fresh.
GQ: Planning for three days works better with shelf life in mind.
GD: Deciding the menu within that span is a good idea.
GQ: Yeah, I'll give it a try.
GD: I'll give it a try too!",6,15,15,15,15

GQ: Do you have a favorite place?
GD: There's a yakiniku place nearby.
GQ: Is their food still good?
GD: It's inconsistent now.
GQ: Any reason why?
GD: There was a fire and they changed management.
GQ: Was the neighborhood affected?
GD: No, just the restaurant.
GQ: That's a relief.
GD: They almost closed during COVID-19.
GQ: How did they stay open?
GD: They renovated and switched to gas.
GQ: Some businesses got subsidies during COVID-19.
GD: Yes, subsidies exceeded usual sales.
GQ: Different areas had different experiences.

GQ: Local businesses did well here.
GD: In Tokyo, many restaurants closed.
GQ: A nearby café also shut down.
GD: Rented shops struggled more.
GQ: There are fewer ramen shops now.
GD: Office areas emptied with remote work.
GQ: Remote work changed many things.
