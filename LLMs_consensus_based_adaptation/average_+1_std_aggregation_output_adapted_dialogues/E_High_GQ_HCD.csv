FO: Good evening.
GQ: Are you studying or working these days?
FO: I'm a student. It's a bit uncertain right now.
GQ: Is the uncertainty related to your credits? That pressure must be really tough.
FO: Yes, and sometimes I just can't wake up in the morning.
GQ: That does sound challenging. How do you manage to attend your classes then?
FO: My sleep schedule is completely reversed.
GQ: Why do you stay up all night?
FO: I just couldn't sleep last night.
GQ: Have you tried reducing your smartphone use before bed? It might help you sleep better.
FO: I do use my smartphone because I can't sleep.
GQ: You know, blue light from screens can keep you awake. Maybe try reading a book instead?

GQ: That must make it hard to concentrate. Does it affect your daily activities a lot?
FO: They're meant to help fix my sleep cycle, but it's tricky.
GQ: Have you thought about exercising during the day? It might improve your sleep at night.
FO: I'd like to talk about something else, if you don't mind.
GQ: Of course, no problem at all. Let's switch topics.
FO: Thank you.
GQ: Do you watch movies?
FO: Not very often. The last movie I watched was Eva.
GQ: Oh, Eva! That’s pretty recent, isn't it?
FO: Yes, it was.
GQ: Was it the final chapter? What did you think of it?
FO: It was a bit iffy for me.
GQ: I’ve only seen the Evangelion TV series.
FO: I’m only familiar with the new theatrical versions.
GQ: That's interesting! Feels like we are from different generations, doesn’t it?
FO: It seems so.",17,15,15,15,15

3,"GQ: Good evening.
GL: Good evening! How can I assist you today?
GQ: Did you go out during the long holiday?
GL: I stayed at home and did some shopping. Did you have any outings?
GQ: I drove for about six hours alone to accompany the children's tournament, and I'm exhausted.
GL: That sounds tiring. Was it a round trip?
GQ: Yes, it's two and a half hours one way, five hours round trip, plus a bit of leisurely driving, making it six hours.
GL: Understood. Was there heavy traffic on your way back?
GQ: Yes, there was a traffic jam on the highway, so I took a side road partway.
GL: Rush hour traffic can be quite congested. Sometimes local roads are quicker.
GQ: Yes, I avoided the traffic jam because it seemed like it would make me sleepy.
GL: Got it. Do you often go on expeditions with your child?
GQ: Due to COVID-19, there were no tournaments for about two years, but this year they are being held at a pace of once a month.
GL: I see. Many restrictions have been lifted. Are you good at driving?
GQ: Whether I'm good at it or not, I like it.
GL: That's good! Enjoying driving makes long-distance trips more pleasant.
GQ: Yes, I enjoyed the autumn scenery. I wasn't driving distracted, though.
GL: The autumn scenery must be beautiful. The trees have started to change color.
GQ: The silver grass was beautiful! Do you go for drives?
GL: I often drive for nearby shopping and errands that last about an hour.
GQ: Do you have any plans to go out this autumn?
GL: Currently, I have no plans, but I am considering shopping at the outlet.
GQ: That's nice! My daughters are eager to go shopping too.
GL: Outlet shopping can be fun, and you can enjoy the scenery on the way.
GQ: Yes, if you can just tolerate the crowds, you can have a wonderful day-trip experience.
GL: I haven't been to the outlet recently. Is it still crowded? Last year it wasn't that crowded.
GQ: The place we are going to is usually very crowded with traffic.
GL: Understood. It can indeed be tiring when it's crowded.
GQ: As long as we can secure a parking space, we'll manage somehow.
GL: I hope you find a spot and enjoy your trip!",2,15,15,15,15
