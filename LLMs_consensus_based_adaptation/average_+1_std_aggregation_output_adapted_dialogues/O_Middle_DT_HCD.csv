1,"DT: Hello. Nice to meet you.
CP: Hello. How can I assist you today?
DT: What were you doing this morning?
CP: Hanging out the laundry. And you?
DT: It's so hot that I don't feel like going out. Any suggestions?
CP: It's raining here, which is inconvenient.
DT: The laundry won’t dry quickly in such weather. Any advice?
CP: Indeed. How's the weather there?
DT: It's brilliantly sunny. Any tips for handling frequent rain?
CP: Where are you located?
DT: In the Kanto region. What about you?
CP: Kyushu. Stay safe in the heat.
DT: Is it going to rain all day? I hope it doesn’t last long.
CP: Yes, intermittent but sometimes heavy rain.
DT: Flooding is a concern here. Are you worried about it?
CP: Yes, it's a concern here too.
DT: Do you live near a river? That sounds stressful.
CP: Yes, a large river nearby. It is concerning.
DT: That sounds problematic. How often does this happen?
CP: The levees have broken in the past.
DT: That’s alarming. Flood disasters are becoming frequent. It's worrisome.
CP: Yes, the weather has been unusual with heavy rain.
DT: It feels tropical. Any ways to handle extreme weather?
CP: Light and regular rainfall would be better.
DT: It's unpredictable if the rainy season has ended. Climate change is concerning.
CP: This year, it didn’t rain much during the rainy season.
DT: That might explain the current rain. It’s unpredictable.
CP: Likely.
DT: It seems it's going to keep raining. Any solutions to avoid major issues?
CP: Rainfall has both pros and cons.",39,15,15,15,15
2,"DT: Nice to meet you.  
CP: Hello! How can I help you today?  
DT: What activities have you been enjoying recently?  
CP: I've been working on a novel.  
DT: That's interesting. Do you enjoy writing more than reading?  
CP: Yes, it's a personal hobby, though I don't consider myself very skilled.  
DT: I find writing quite challenging.  
CP: Thank you. It's fun to connect with other writers online.  
DT: Do you share your work online?  
CP: Yes, I post it and enter short story contests.  
DT: Sounds convenient. You can write anywhere with a computer.  
CP: Exactly. I usually write about 5 to 10 pages at a time.  
DT: Even 5 pages sound like a lot to me.  
CP: Some writers manage around 500 pages.  
DT: Have you always been interested in writing?  
CP: No, a friend introduced me to it, and I found it enjoyable.  
DT: So, your friend got you into writing?  
CP: Yes, my friend writes around 300 pages for competitions.  
DT: That might catch a publisher's eye.  
CP: Writing 300 pages is too much for me.  
DT: How were you raised?  
CP: We were just ordinary kids, didn’t read much.  
DT: Surprising that you write well without reading a lot.  
CP: It is surprising! But I always liked picture books.  
DT: Picture books are lovely.  
CP: The illustrations are soothing.  
DT: I used to love ""Guri and Gura.""  
CP: I love those pancakes too.  
DT: They seem perfect.

3,"DT: Hello!
CP: Hello! How can I help you today?
DT: It's tough to decide what to have for dinner every day. What are you planning to eat today?
CP: I'm making Mapo eggplant.
DT: That sounds great! Maybe I'll try making that as well.
CP: Eggplants are in season now, so it's a good time to cook with them.
DT: I don't buy eggplants often. Are they really in season now?
CP: Yes, they are. I actually got these from my father's vegetable garden.
DT: Fresh vegetables from the garden must taste amazing!
CP: They do. It’s convenient to have family nearby. Do you have family close by?
DT: No, my parents live quite far away, and I haven't visited them in years.
CP: That must be difficult, especially during COVID-19.
DT: Yes, many people can't go home because of COVID-19 restrictions.
CP: Are you planning to travel by Shinkansen or airplane when you visit?
DT: Shinkansen, but I'm concerned about the ventilation.
CP: Enclosed spaces can be risky during the pandemic.
DT: I also feel uneasy in crowded elevators.
CP: Crowded places can be uncomfortable.
DT: I hope the pandemic ends soon.
CP: I agree. Do you often have video calls with your family?
DT: Yes, they really enjoy seeing their grandchild.
CP: Those calls must be very special for them.
DT: Yes, they suggested we don't visit to avoid exposing the baby to COVID-19.
CP: That makes sense. Your family must be hoping for the pandemic to end soon.
DT: I was planning to go home this summer. I really dislike COVID-19.
CP: They must miss you a lot and look forward to your visit.
DT: We met in May, and the baby has grown so much since then.
CP: I hope the situation improves soon so you can visit safely.
DT: Yes, indeed. Let's hope neither of us gets COVID.
CP: Absolutely. Stay safe and take care!",7,15,15,15,15

DT: Do they include eggs in the original version too?
EM: Yes, often with a croquette on top.
DT: Talking about this makes me hungry.
EM: Food discussions can do that!
DT: I could really eat some udon now.
EM: It's easy to eat anytime. You could have it for dinner too.
DT: Maybe not kama-tama at night, though?
EM: True, but we could try something different.
DT: Does the temperature depend on the soup base?
EM: The soup is usually store-bought. How about making yaki udon instead?
DT: Great idea! I’ll try that.
EM: Let’s do that!",26,15,15,15,15

DT: What did you eat for dinner today?
DY: Today I ate yaki udon!
DT: It looks delicious. Do you often make yaki udon?
DY: Yes, it's easy to make, so I often cook it! What did you eat?
DT: I ate saury and negitoro bowl.
DY: Pacific saury, huh! It feels like autumn already!
DT: That's right. Speaking of which, the package did say ""new product.""
DY: Sounds good! By the way, it’s already September starting today.
DT: It's fast, isn't it!!!
DY: It's early! It still feels a bit hot though. I hope it gets cooler.

DT: I have been to the pool only once.
DY: The pool is nice! Is it a big pool?

DY: I see, that must have been a bit tough. Is the bath at your house okay?
DT: Yes, that's right. I'm in a pretty good mood. So I misunderstood.
DY: I see, that was unfortunate.
DT: Yes, I was looking forward to it, so it was especially disappointing.
DY: When a little more time has passed, let's definitely try again.
DT: Yes, it seems it will still be a while. It was completely my parents' ego.
