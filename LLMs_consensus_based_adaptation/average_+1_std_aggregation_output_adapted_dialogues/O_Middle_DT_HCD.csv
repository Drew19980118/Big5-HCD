CP: Hello! How can I help you today?  
DT: What activities have you been enjoying recently?

DT: That's interesting. Do you enjoy writing more than reading?  
CP: Yes, it's a personal hobby, though I don't consider myself very skilled.

CP: Thank you. It's fun to connect with other writers online.  
DT: Do you share your work online?  
CP: Yes, I post it and enter short story contests.  
DT: Sounds convenient. You can write anywhere with a computer.  
CP: Exactly. I usually write about 5 to 10 pages at a time.  
DT: Even 5 pages sound like a lot to me.  
CP: Some writers manage around 500 pages.  
DT: Have you always been interested in writing?  
CP: No, a friend introduced me to it, and I found it enjoyable.  
DT: So, your friend got you into writing?  
CP: Yes, my friend writes around 300 pages for competitions.

DT: How were you raised?

CP: Hello! How can I help you today?
DT: It's tough to decide what to have for dinner every day. What are you planning to eat today?
CP: I'm making Mapo eggplant.
DT: That sounds great! Maybe I'll try making that as well.
CP: Eggplants are in season now, so it's a good time to cook with them.
DT: I don't buy eggplants often. Are they really in season now?
CP: Yes, they are. I actually got these from my father's vegetable garden.
DT: Fresh vegetables from the garden must taste amazing!
CP: They do. It’s convenient to have family nearby. Do you have family close by?
DT: No, my parents live quite far away, and I haven't visited them in years.
CP: That must be difficult, especially during COVID-19.
DT: Yes, many people can't go home because of COVID-19 restrictions.
CP: Are you planning to travel by Shinkansen or airplane when you visit?
DT: Shinkansen, but I'm concerned about the ventilation.
CP: Enclosed spaces can be risky during the pandemic.
DT: I also feel uneasy in crowded elevators.
CP: Crowded places can be uncomfortable.
DT: I hope the pandemic ends soon.
CP: I agree. Do you often have video calls with your family?
DT: Yes, they really enjoy seeing their grandchild.
CP: Those calls must be very special for them.
DT: Yes, they suggested we don't visit to avoid exposing the baby to COVID-19.
CP: That makes sense. Your family must be hoping for the pandemic to end soon.
DT: I was planning to go home this summer. I really dislike COVID-19.
CP: They must miss you a lot and look forward to your visit.
DT: We met in May, and the baby has grown so much since then.
CP: I hope the situation improves soon so you can visit safely.
DT: Yes, indeed. Let's hope neither of us gets COVID.
CP: Absolutely. Stay safe and take care!",7,15,15,15,15
