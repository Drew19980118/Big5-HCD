BL: Nice to meet you.
CC: Did you do anything summery?
BL: Played with water in the bath.
CC: Do you have children?
BL: Yes, I put her in a swimsuit to cheer her up.
CC: We can't go to the sea or the pool, can we?
BL: We can this year, but the pool feels scary.
CC: Because of COVID-19?
BL: Yes, I haven't been to a pool due to COVID-19.
CC: That does sound scary.
BL: You have to get used to it young. I can't swim either.
CC: I wasn't good at it either. After walking along the beach, I wanted to swim.
BL: That sounds refreshing. Maybe try a beach with a gentle shoreline.
CC: Can I still swim? Not sure.
BL: If you could swim before, you should be fine.
CC: I haven't swum as an adult.
BL: That's uncommon. At the sea, you'd just play on the beach.
CC: I haven't ridden a bicycle for about 10 years.
BL: 10 years is long. I rode normally after a few years.
CC: Riding on the road makes me nervous.
BL: It's scary where there are many cars.
CC: I feel scared seeing bicycles on the road or sidewalk.
BL: Separated sidewalks for bikes and pedestrians might be safer.
CC: Yes, that would be good.
BL: More separated sidewalks would help.
CC: I saw many bike sections at Kawasaki Station.
BL: Some places are more advanced regionally.
CC: I think so.
BL: Hopefully, more places improve.",13,15,15,15,15
3,"CC: Hello! Nice to meet you.
BL: Hello! How can I assist you today?
CC: What do you do in your free time?
BL: I check social media.
CC: Do you use Instagram?
BL: Mostly Twitter.
CC: I check Twitter occasionally too.
BL: I often see recommended tweets, not just my friends' posts.
CC: Do you think Twitter’s recommendations are too frequent?
BL: Yes, there are too many from people I don't know.
CC: I see many tweets from people I don’t follow.
BL: It can be overwhelming, often full of complaints.
CC: I don’t check Twitter often, so there are many updates piled up.
BL: Many users post frequently, which can be hard to keep up with.
CC: I use Instagram more. How about you?
BL: I rarely use Instagram and often have to log in again each time.
CC: I recently installed TikTok.
BL: TikTok has a lot of dancing content.
CC: I didn’t quite get the vibe.
BL: It seems to have content that doesn't suit everyone.
CC: I like dancing, so I thought it might be fun.
BL: Have you danced before?
CC: A bit when I was a student.
BL: Dance styles have really evolved over time.
CC: I found Chocopla on TikTok; they're funny.
BL: Are they comedians?
CC: Do you know Chocolate Planet? Their content is unique and entertaining.
BL: Their non-dance content might be worth checking out.
CC: Their content really stood out amidst the usual TikTok posts.
BL: That sounds interesting.
CC: Thank you for the chat!
BL: You're welcome.",52,16,16,16,16

BR: Hello.  
CC: Do you exercise?  
BR: I walk and do sit-ups.  
CC: Do you walk often?  
BR: More than an hour a day, before it got hot.  
CC: Is an hour necessary?  
BR: Benefits start after 20 minutes.  
CC: Understood. Do you do any other exercise?  
BR: Do you exercise?  
CC: Not much, but thinking about walking by the river near my house.  
BR: Is the river close? We visit ours often.  
CC: The heat and wind have been strong lately.  
BR: Is your river wide?  
CC: Yes, and the sea is close.  
BR: The wind must be strong. Our river is mountain-side, not wide.  
CC: Is the current swift?  
BR: The currents are calm.  
CC: Watching water flow is relaxing.  
BR: Watching from the bridge is nice.  
CC: The sun affects my eyes.  
BR: It's tough without shade on sunny days.  
CC: Is the wind strong on the bridge?  
BR: Not much here, so it's okay.  
CC: On windy days, the bridge sways.  
BR: Really? Upstream and downstream differ a lot.  
CC: I want to explore from the river's uppermost stream to the sea.  
BR: River rafting sounds fun.  
CC: I saw an ad for that.  
BR: Noted.",16,15,15,15,15
5,"CC: Good evening!
CH: Good evening, nice to meet you.
CC: Nice to meet you. Did you go out somewhere today?
CH: Today, I only went for a walk after dinner, and I haven't particularly gone out otherwise.
CC: Oh, you went for a walk! Do you walk frequently?
CH: If it doesn't rain, I walk every day, but in the past two weeks, there has been a lot of rain and I haven't been able to walk.
CC: Every day? The rain finally stopped, didn't it?
CH: That's right. The temperature in the mornings and evenings has started to drop.
CC: It was cool this morning too.
CH: It gets hot quickly, but a little while ago it was even hot early in the morning.
CC: Shall we walk for about an hour?
CH: It's about just one hour. I determine it based on distance, and it's roughly a distance that takes an hour.
CC: It's impressive that you can keep it up every day. Was there any particular reason or motivation that made you think you had to exercise?
CH: I used to exercise quite a lot, but after being sick, I lost the motivation, so at least I'm trying to walk.
CC: You must have had physical strength to begin with.
CH: Looking back, I think I was energetic. For example, if I came home at midnight, I would run until 1 AM.
CC: From midnight! That's very energetic. What time did you go to work?
CH: I generally arrived at work around 8:30. It was not often that I stayed late.
CC: You have incredible stamina. Just work alone leaves me exhausted. Normally.
CH: Being young was also a factor, but as expected, things can easily fall apart with some kind of trigger, can't they?
CC: After moving that much, you must have been able to sleep soundly.
CH: That's right. However, even quite a while before I got sick, I had been experiencing sleep paralysis more frequently.
CC: Is that so? What causes sleep paralysis?
CH: Stress and overwork are often talked about.
CC: Is that so? But from what I heard, you were overworking.
CH: Looking back, you realize that it was overdoing it or a sign, don't you?
CC: There are things you only understand after they've passed, aren't there?
CH: In any case, I want to be careful in the future so that I can get a good night's sleep.
CC: That's right!
CH: Thank you very much.",1,15,15,15,15
6,"CC: Good evening!  
CH: Good evening. How can I assist you today?  
CC: Are you not sleepy yet at this time of day?  
CH: It depends on the day, but I usually start to feel sleepy around now.  
CC: Do you usually go to bed around midnight?  
CH: Yes, it's often around midnight. How about you?  
CC: I usually go to bed a little later, around 1 or 2 o'clock.  
CH: Do you feel sleepy the next morning if you sleep at 2 o'clock?  
CC: I'm not working right now, so it's manageable. When I am working, I aim to be asleep by 1 o'clock.  
CH: Understood. Sleep needs can vary greatly among individuals.  
CC: It seems that whether someone is a morning person or a night person may be influenced by genetics.  
CH: That's correct. Some people are naturally more active at night.  
CC: Matsuko Deluxe once said, ""I'm completely a night owl.""  
CH: That makes sense for some people.  
CC: I would be surprised if you were a morning person.  
CH: Right. Some people function well on shorter sleep durations, while others need more sleep.  
CC: I find that about seven hours of sleep is just right for me. How about you?  
CH: I generally need around 8 hours of sleep.  
CC: Sleeping for 10 hours seems excessive, doesn't it?  
CH: Generally, adults don't require 10 hours of sleep.  
CC: If I sleep for 10 hours, I find it hard to wake up.  
CH: In rural areas, children often sleep more due to fewer activities after dark.  
CC: Do people sleep more in the countryside?  
CH: It can vary, but that's often the trend.  
CC: Interesting, I didn't have that image of rural life.  
CH: In rural areas, there are fewer activities available after dark.  
CC: I see! Do children visit friends' houses in the evening?  
CH: Most children in rural areas go home by 5 o'clock.  
CC: That's early. Rural nights are very dark.  
CH: Yes, for growing children, sufficient sleep is very healthy.",2,15,15,15,15

BV: Hello! Nice to meet you too.
CC: What do you do on your days off from work?
BV: Mostly tidying up the house.
CC: Got it. Is it all sorted out now?
BV: It's challenging. It gets messy quickly.
CC: Tidying up can be tricky. I get it.
BV: With work, I can't focus on that much.
CC: Understood. Even if I clean up over the weekend, it gets messy again by the next weekend.
BV: It would be nice to be better at tidying up.
CC: Do you have a fixed day off?
BV: I usually have Sundays off.
CC: So, the others are work days?
BV: Correct.
CC: That’s tough. But having Sundays off means you might be able to meet friends.
BV: Yes, I played with my friends last Sunday.
CC: In the past, when I had to work weekends and holidays, I couldn't meet anyone.
BV: That makes coordinating breaks difficult.
CC: Indeed.
BV: Were you in the service industry?
CC: Yes, at that time. Weekends and holidays were crucial.
BV: Understood.
CC: Weekdays off are convenient for errands.
BV: Weekdays off can be nice.
CC: I'd like one weekday off and one weekend day off.
BV: Privacy is important.
CC: Not seeing anyone can get exhausting.
BV: You need a break.
CC: Taking a break is important!
BV: Got it. Have a good day.",8,15,15,15,15

BH: Thank you in advance.  
CC: It's rainy today. The thunder was intense until just a while ago.  
BH: Is that so? It hasn't rained here yet.  
CC: Oh, really? Where are you located?  
BH: Where are you located?  
CC: It's the Chubu region!  
BH: Understood. Thunder can be quite intense.  
CC: Yesterday was extremely hot...  
BH: It's been especially hot lately, hasn't it?  
CC: Yes, it really has. Do you think it's a trend or just a temporary thing?  
BH: It is difficult to predict, but such fluctuations can occur.  
CC: I end up eating too many cold things when it's hot. Like ice cream, right?  
BH: Yes, like ice cream and juice.  
CC: I agree. But when you sweat a lot and then go into a place with strong air conditioning, it feels extremely cold.  
BH: Air conditioners can indeed feel very cold.  
CC: The company I used to work for was hot in the winter and cold in the summer.  
BH: That sounds uncomfortable.  
CC: It was difficult to regulate my body temperature.  
BH: Even with the temperature set to 28 degrees, it can still feel really cold.  
CC: But when it's set to 27 degrees, it feels hot.  
BH: Finding the perfect setting can be difficult.  
CC: Maybe 27.5 degrees would be good.  
BH: Unfortunately, that temperature setting is not available.  
CC: But today the temperature is just right.  
BH: I've been at home, so it might feel a bit cold.  
CC: Is that so? I also spend a lot of time indoors. Do you think staying inside affects our perception of temperature?  
BH: Staying indoors for prolonged periods can indeed make it hard to adjust to the outside temperature.",7,15,15,15,15
