DU: It's enjoyable all day with music and shopping, then sleeping in a tent at night.
DL: I've never been camping. Do you often go camping?
DU: I started at the end of last year, so I'm still new to it.
DL: Was there a specific reason you started?
DU: My husband was interested, and I became curious after seeing my friends do it.
DL: How was your first experience? Did you enjoy it more than expected?
DU: Yes, I became very interested. Now, I can't stop wanting more camping gear.
DL: What kind of things do you want now?
DU: A new tent, but I already have three and storage is a problem.
DL: Even with three, you want more? Do they have amazing features or is it the brand?
DU: It's mostly about the appearance and size differences.
DL: Do you mean you want to use them for different purposes?
DU: Yes, I want to differentiate their uses.
DL: It sounds like you're really getting into it.
DU: It's quite consuming.
DL: Do tents cost a lot?
DU: They vary. My first was a pop-up tent under 20,000 yen.
DL: So 20,000 yen is considered cheap? Are there more expensive options?
