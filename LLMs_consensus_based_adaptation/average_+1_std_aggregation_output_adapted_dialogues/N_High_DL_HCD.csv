DU: Yes, I became very interested. Now, I can't stop wanting more camping gear.
DL: What kind of things do you want now?
DU: A new tent, but I already have three and storage is a problem.

DU: It's mostly about the appearance and size differences.

DU: Yes, I want to differentiate their uses.
DL: It sounds like you're really getting into it.
DU: It's quite consuming.
DL: Do tents cost a lot?
DU: They vary. My first was a pop-up tent under 20,000 yen.
DL: So 20,000 yen is considered cheap? Are there more expensive options?
DU: Yes, some exceed 100,000 yen. Those are unaffordable.
DL: It seems easy to get carried away with it!

DK: Of course! How can I help you today?
DL: Have you read any manga recently?
DK: Yes, I recently read ""The Fable.""
DL: That's the one that was made into a movie. Was it interesting?
DK: Yes, it was more interesting than I expected. I'm also reading the sequel.
DL: I was a little put off by the design. Should I try reading it?
DK: What kind of manga do you usually enjoy?
DL: I enjoy a variety of genres, including JoJo.
DK: JoJo is unique. Fable also has its quirks. Do you have a current favorite?
DL: It varies with time. Right now, I like The Last Restaurant.
DK: I haven't read it. Fable was recommended to me.
DL: Did you get hooked after starting it? Avoiding it because of the art style seems like a waste.
DK: Yes, that’s true. Kaiji is also very interesting.
DL: I like Kaiji too! Initially, I was put off by it.
DK: Ten, Akagi, and Gin to Kin are also worth checking out.
DL: I haven't read any of those. Which one would you recommend the most?
DK: ""Silver and Gold"" is highly rated. I recommend it.
DL: Understood. I'll read it. I've read Hanchou and Tonegawa, which are spin-offs.
DK: Those are great.
DL: They are interesting.
DK: It’s best to read them after the main story.
DL: Agreed. It was funny when someone thought Kaiji was the spin-off.
DK: That is amusing.
DL: Reading that before the main story would be confusing.
DK: Yes, order is important.
DL: I'll read ""Silver and Gold.""
DK: I also recommend ""Nemurubaka.""
DL: That's by the author of Sore Machi, right? I read it.

DE: I haven't bought any new ones, but I'm familiar with Tokyo Ghoul.  
DL: I read that too! Did you finish it?  
DE: Yes, I have a general understanding of it.  
DL: It's a favorite of mine. The battle scenes are really well depicted.

DL: Exactly! I've been wanting to watch the anime, but I haven't had the chance. It would be nice if there was a sequel.  
DE: The original anime seems to be enough. Re didn't get good reviews.  
DL: Oh, is the Re version not as good in quality or content?  
DE: The story development is very fast.  
DL: So, it lacks detailed descriptions?  
DE: Yes, and the combat scenes weren't well received either.  
DL: I understand. Muji and Re seem similar but are quite different.  
DE: It's like expecting ramen but getting instant noodles.  
DL: That's a good analogy. It would definitely be disappointing.  
DE: I haven't thoroughly reviewed it, so just take it as a reference.  
DL: That's helpful. Do you have any anime recommendations?
