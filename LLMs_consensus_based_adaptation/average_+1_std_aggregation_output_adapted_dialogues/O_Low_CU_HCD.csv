1,"CU: Hello!  
ED: Hi!  
CU: The summer's heat was intense this year!  
ED: Yes, it was quite hot.  
CU: I went to an outdoor music festival last weekend and got heatstroke.  
ED: That sounds concerning. Are you okay now?  
CU: I was out in the sun for about five hours, and then I got a headache and nausea.  
ED: That must have been tough. Did you recover quickly?  
CU: Yes, I went to the infirmary alone and felt better after resting.  
ED: I'm relieved to hear that. Was it during the day?  
CU: Yes, it was an all-day event, and I got tired in the afternoon.  
ED: Big crowd, I assume?  
CU: Yes, the crowd was so large it was easy to forget about COVID-19. Did you go anywhere?  
ED: I visited Karuizawa at the end of July.  
CU: Karuizawa? I've never been there. Is it nice?  
ED: It was over 30 degrees, surprisingly hot.  
CU: Even Karuizawa gets hot. How did you spend your time?  
ED: I attended my younger brother's wedding.  
CU: Where was the venue?  
ED: It was at the Stone Church of Hoshino Resorts.  
CU: I know that place! It's a beautiful chapel.  
ED: Yes, it was quite stunning.  
CU: Since I worked in the bridal industry, the food must have been great.  
ED: The food was excellent.  
CU: I want to visit someday.  
ED: Despite the heat, it was very beautiful.  
CU: Since I live in Kansai, it's hard to get to Karuizawa.  
ED: I'm from Kansai too! The access from Tokyo is easier.  
CU: So you're from Kansai! It's easier to get there from Tokyo.  
ED: Yes, I took my time passing through Nagoya.",10,15,15,15,15
2,"CU: Thank you in advance.  
ED: Sure, I'm here to help.  
CU: Have you picked up any new hobbies or interests recently?  
ED: Yes, I've started doing jigsaw puzzles.  
CU: That sounds enjoyable. Is it a large one?  
ED: It's 1000 pieces, so it's moderately sized.  
CU: You could get lost in that for hours.  
ED: Indeed, it's easy to lose track of time.  
CU: Do you have many completed puzzles?  
ED: Yes, quite a few. I had to stop displaying them because there were too many.  
CU: What do you do with a jigsaw puzzle after finishing it?  
ED: Do you enjoy puzzles?  
CU: I've done a few in the past.  
ED: I usually break them down and store them away.  
CU: Doesn't it feel wasteful to dismantle them?  
ED: I keep and display only the ones I'm especially proud of.  
CU: That makes sense. I might take up puzzling again.  
ED: It's a good indoor activity.  
CU: Thanks for sharing!  
ED: My pleasure. Have you been interested in anything new lately?  
CU: I've gotten into K-pop groups recently.  
ED: Like BTS?  
CU: Yes, I like BTS, but I’m more into their brother group, TXT, right now.  
ED: K-pop is trending.  
CU: Yes, I can spend hours watching videos about it. They’re so talented!  
ED: There are even K-pop dance schools now.  
CU: Yes, some kids in my neighborhood attend them.  
ED: An acquaintance's child also goes to one.  
CU: That's amazing. They have a bright future.  
ED: Absolutely. Enjoy your new interests and hobbies!",24,15,15,15,15
3,"CU: Good evening!  
ED: Good evening!  
CU: Do you have any pets?  
ED: No, I don't. Do you?  
CU: Yes, I have a dog.  
ED: What breed is it?  
CU: Have you heard of the Cavalier breed?  
ED: No, is it rare?  
CU: It might be. It's a small to medium-sized dog with floppy ears.  
ED: Is it in 101 Dalmatians?  
CU: Maybe. They are gentle but shed a lot.  
ED: How old is your dog?  
CU: Six years old.  
ED: Older dogs have a special charm.  
CU: Yes, they do. What kind of dog do you like?  
ED: I like bigger dogs and Shiba Inu. What about you?  
CU: I also love big dogs, but it's hard to keep one.  
ED: My cousin had a Siberian Husky. It was very cute.  
CU: Huskies are friendly, right?  
ED: Yes, they look like wolves but are affectionate.  
CU: That contrast is interesting.  
ED: Yes, but they shed a lot in summer.  
CU: We have that problem too. July is the worst for us.  
ED: The heat probably causes it.  
CU: The Roomba fills up quickly with all the fur.  
ED: Pets are soothing, aren't they?  
CU: Yes, they are. I hope you can have one someday.  
ED: I hope so too. I’m away from home a lot due to work, which is a concern.  
CU: That's a tough problem.  
ED: Yes, and leaving them somewhere is also a concern.",11,15,15,15,15

DN: Hello. How can I assist you today?
CU: Today was another hot and humid day.
DN: Yes, it is very hot. How are you managing?
CU: It’s tough. Did you go out?
DN: Yes, for work.
CU: Good job! Is your work indoors?
DN: Yes, fortunately.
CU: Same here. It’s tough outside.
DN: Do you leave early to avoid the heat?
CU: No, I leave at 8.
DN: That's earlier than 9 or 10.
CU: True. I went to an outdoor festival last week and got heatstroke.
DN: What type of festival was it?
CU: Summer Sonic, a music festival. Have you heard of it?
DN: No. Is it an artist?
CU: No, it’s an event with many artists.
DN: Understood. Which artists were there?
CU: Do you know Yuri or Motohiro Hata?
DN: I’m not familiar, but it sounds interesting.
CU: It was fun, but the heat was too much.
DN: Were you wearing a mask?
CU: Yes, we did what we could.
DN: That must have been difficult. Was it outdoors?
CU: Yes, in the sun. Umbrellas were banned, so I used a hat.
DN: That sounds challenging. Did your hat stay on securely?
CU: Exactly. Some people collapsed from the heat. This summer is extreme.
DN: Yes, it is. Were you standing the whole time?
CU: Only when my favorite artists performed. Please check it out if interested.
DN: Noted. Thank you for the information.",7,15,15,15,15
5,"CU: Hello!
DN: Hello. How can I assist you today?
CU: Have you traveled anywhere recently?
DN: I often visit the Kansai region on weekends.
CU: Which places do you usually visit there?
DN: Nishinomiya.
CU: Why do you go to Nishinomiya?
DN: To study music and visit my son in Mita.
CU: Is your job related to music?
DN: No. I want to become a musician and need good teachers.
CU: That's wonderful! I also love music and play the piano. What instrument do you study?
DN: I study the harpsichord.
CU: Harpsichords have such a beautiful sound, especially for Bach's music.
DN: Yes, I enjoy playing Bach on it.
CU: Do you have a harpsichord at home?
DN: Yes. What do you play on the piano?
CU: I'm practicing pieces by Chopin and Debussy.
DN: I admire those composers, though I can't play their pieces on the harpsichord.
CU: I recently visited the Yamaha piano factory in Kakegawa. It was really interesting!
DN: Shizuoka has many music-related places.
CU: Yes, I saw a harpsichord on display and even tried it.
DN: Was it a large harpsichord?
CU: No, it was a small one.
DN: Harpsichords are on display at both Kawai and Yamaha.
CU: Are they expensive?
DN: Yes, a Kawai harpsichord costs around 2 million yen.
CU: That's a significant investment, similar to a grand piano.
DN: Yes, each harpsichord is unique, and imported ones cost even more.
CU: Keep practicing and pursuing your passion!

6,"CU: Good evening!

DN: Good evening. How can I assist you tonight?

CU: Have you decided on tonight's dinner?

DN: We will eat out tonight.

CU: Nice! Just the two of you?

DN: No, my college-aged son is home for the holidays, so the three of us will go out together.

CU: That sounds lovely! Do you know where you'll go?

DN: I'm considering either shabu-shabu or yakiniku.

CU: Both are great choices! Young people really love meat.

DN: Yes. I have my preferences, but I want my son to decide.

CU: That makes sense. It must be wonderful having him home.

DN: It is. There's a certain ease when he's nearby.

CU: They say a son is always a concern for his mother, no matter his age.

DN: Are your children still living with you?

CU: Yes, they are in junior high, so we're still together. I'm already anxious about when they leave.

DN: I used to be a strong mother, but now I try to show some vulnerability.

CU: Your sons must have felt the need to be strong because of that.

DN: Yes, that was part of the issue. They felt they had to be strong when I appeared weak.

CU: I understand. I'm quite responsible too, but maybe I should show some vulnerability as well.

DN: Mothers often seem more reliable than their sons, don't they?

CU: Yes, they likely feel the need to be strong, but it can backfire.

DN: That's true. A teacher told them to value their pride.

CU: My mother-in-law says that too! Boys have high pride.

DN: Yes. I think real-life skills are more important, but boys think differently.

CU: It's challenging. Boys and girls are so different.

DN: They are. I need to show some vulnerability.

CU: Since my son has been reliable lately, I think I'll depend on him more.

DN: Yes, but too much vulnerability can be overwhelming. A little is better.

CU: Balancing that is tough. It's a process of trial and error.

DN: Absolutely. I will keep trying my best!",7,15,15,15,15

BH: I understand.
CU: We wrap the meat with seasoned bean sprouts, green onions, and kimchi in lettuce or perilla leaves.
