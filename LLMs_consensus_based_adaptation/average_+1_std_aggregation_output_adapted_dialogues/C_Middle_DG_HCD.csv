2,"DG: Nice to meet you!
DV: Hello, nice to meet you.
DG: Have you been into anything lately?
DV: Watching quiz shows at home.
DG: Quiz shows seem educational.
DV: They might be good for brain activation.
DG: Even elementary school problems seem difficult.
DV: I don't remember much despite studying.
DG: Watching them, I realize I don't remember these things.
DV: I'm worried my child might soon surpass me.
DG: Having children does bring urgency.

DG: I'd feel frustrated and want to study. Me too.
DV: We forget things we don't use regularly.
DG: That's right. What was your favorite subject?
DV: Mathematics.
DG: Oh! Completely the opposite.

DG: High school. I was very homesick.  
DV: Initially fun, then homesick?  
DG: Yes, and the food made me lonely.

DG: Sounds like an idol concert. Quite intense.
DV: Since then, I stick to DVDs.
DG: I felt out of place at a Yuzu concert. Very energetic.
DV: Yuzu's concerts don't seem overly energetic.
DG: Surprisingly, they were lively with jumping and dancing.
DV: Are most live performances like that?
DG: I'd prefer a calm concert where I can sit and listen.
DV: A seated concert would be nice.
DG: Standing can be tiring. I'd rather sit and enjoy.
DV: Hard to sit when everyone else is standing.
