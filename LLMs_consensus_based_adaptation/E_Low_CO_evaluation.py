In this simulation, only the style of each utterance will be changed without altering its content and meaning.  
            ## Human Computer Dialogue:

            The conversion of this Human Human Dialogue into Human Computer Dialogue is based on the following Additional Knowledge:

            {additional_knowledge}

            You will analyze two aspects of the Human Computer Dialogue converted from Human Human Dialogue:

            Task 1. Analyze whether this Human Computer Dialogue strictly follows the Additional Knowledge to transform the original Human Human Dialogue, you may need to refer {first_speaker}'s Personality Traits Score & Personality Traits Description.

            Task 2. Check whether the content and meaning of all utterances (from both Human Role and Computer Role) are preserved without alteration from the original Human Human Dialogue.

            Your output must only have two kinds:
            1. If you believe both of the tasks are complete. The final output is 'Task Completed'.
            2. If you think any task is incomplete, provide a single confidence score (0.0-1.0, 0.01 increments) reflecting the overall performance across both tasks, along with your feedback listing the specific deficiencies.
            The final output is: 'Feedback: [your detailed feedback], Score: [confidence score]'.

            Differences Between Human Human Dialogue (HHD) and Human Computer Dialogue (HCD):

            Communication Styles:

            HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are characterized by brief, frequent exchanges that prioritize efficiency. Humans expect clear, straightforward responses without unnecessary elaboration.
            Example: Human: "What time is my next meeting?" System: "Your meeting starts at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B."

            HHD: Interactions between humans are more nuanced and context-rich, often incorporating additional details, shared thoughts, or collaborative reasoning.
            Example: Person A: "The weather app says itâ€™ll stay clear, but the sky looks a bit hazy. Do you think we should leave earlier for the hike?" Person B: "Good pointâ€”maybe we can avoid the afternoon crowd too. Letâ€™s aim for 8 AM instead!"

            Relational and Personality Expression:

            HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are transactional and lack emotional depth or personal connection, as machines are incapable of genuine empathy or emotional understanding.
            Example: Human: "Iâ€™m overwhelmed with work deadlines." System: "Would you like me to schedule a reminder for your tasks?"

            HHD: Human interactions are infused with emotional expression, humor, and openness, fostering trust and mutual understanding. These exchanges often include empathy, support, and shared problem-solving.
            Example: Person A: "Iâ€™ve been swamped with deadlines all weekâ€”itâ€™s exhausting." Person B: "That sounds rough. Want to grab coffee later? We can brainstorm ways to tackle it together."
