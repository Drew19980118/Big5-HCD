CP: Reading and swimming.
EA: What genres do you read?
CP: Mysteries.
EA: Have you read any mystery authors?
CP: Yes. What about you?
EA: I read ""Everything Becomes F"" after a friend recommended it.
CP: That's by Mr. Mori. It's popular.
EA: I didn't realize it was well-known.
CP: Yes, it's his debut work and very popular.
EA: Is Mr. Mori writing anything else?
CP: Yes, like the Sky Crawlers series.
EA: I'll keep that in mind.
CP: It's a battle fantasy.
EA: Any other recommendations?
CP: ""Murders at the House of Corpses"" by Masahiro Imamura.

CP: It sold well and became a movie.
EA: Oh, that's why it sounds familiar.
CP: He has several interesting series.
EA: Did you watch the movie?

CP: Hello.  
EA: Do you have any favorite foods?  
CP: I like tomatoes.  
EA: Interesting! Many people don't seem to like tomatoes, right?  
CP: Correct. I enjoy fresh tomatoes, soup, pasta, and ketchup.  
EA: I also like tomatoes, but tomato juice isn't my favorite.  
CP: Many people don't like tomato juice.  
EA: Some find it too strong.  
CP: Tomato juice can be thick.  
EA: I guess that's why I don't like it. But tomatoes in various dishes are great!  
CP: Understood. What other foods do you like?  
EA: I really enjoy hamburg steak and fried chicken.  
CP: Both are popular and delicious.  
EA: Did you know there's an amazing hamburger specialty store in Shizuoka Prefecture?  
CP: No, where did you hear about it?  
EA: A friend mentioned ""Sawayaka."" Just hearing about it made my mouth water!  
CP: Shizuoka is too far for me.  
EA: Same here, but I'd love to visit if I get the chance!  
CP: Oita is famous for karaage.  
EA: Oh, I've heard of Oita's karaage and toriten!  
CP: Many take-out karaage shops exist.  
EA: Sounds like you'd never have trouble finding dinner there.  
CP: Correct. We usually don't make fried chicken at home.  
EA: Do you make non-fried karaage at home?  
CP: Yes, at home it is.  
EA: I don't cook much, so I didn't think of frying at home.  
CP: Store-bought karaage varies in taste.  
EA: I'd love to try the different flavors!  
CP: In Oita, all are delicious.",11,15,15,15,15

DY: I prefer the ""Gachi Area"" rule, where you focus on painting a specific area.  
EA: Oh, I've seen that in streams. It's about controlling specific areas, correct?

DY: I've only played Minecraft solo, but it sounds fun to play with friends.

DY: Do you feel like you have a group of gaming friends now?  
EA: Yes, the group grew as I played with acquaintances from different games.

CZ: I often have rice with raw egg on holiday mornings.
EA: It's quick and tasty. Do you ever eat bread?
CZ: On weekdays, I usually eat white bread.

EA: I prefer a stronger taste. What about you?
CZ: I'm experimenting with different amounts to find the best taste.
EA: There are many types of soy sauce. As for bread, I like peanut butter.

CZ: Hello! How can I assist you today?
EA: Where do you live?
CZ: I am located in the western part of Kansai.
EA: Was it Kansai? I'm from Kyushu, but I envy Kansai!
CZ: I see. It's a more remote countryside area.

CZ: There are people in urban areas, but here there are many mountains, rivers, and rice fields.
EA: Kansai has various aspects, doesn't it? Do you go to the city center to have fun?
CZ: I hardly go. I prefer outdoor activities.
EA: What comes to mind when you think of the outdoors?
CZ: Surfing and mountain climbing, for example.
EA: Oh, awesome! Isn't surfing in season right now?
CZ: In midsummer, the weather is too good and there are no waves, so the period right after Obon is the perfect time.
EA: I see. Surfing is difficult, isn't it? How long have you been doing it?
CZ: It's been about 15 or 16 years, but it's only about 2 or 3 times a year.
EA: You are quite experienced. How long have you been doing mountain climbing?
CZ: I started mountain climbing during the COVID-19 pandemic when I was looking for other activities to do.
EA: I see. If that's the case, then it might be recent. I have memories from my childhood where I didn't want to go hiking anymore.
CZ: Why is that? Did something specific happen?
EA: I think I was simply tired from walking. My parents liked hiking, so we often went.
CZ: That pleasant tiredness from walking can become addictive.
EA: It might be different if I go now as an adult. Since I have a lot of indoor hobbies, I need to exercise a bit.
CZ: Do you spend your time watching videos, for example?
EA: I see. I often watch YouTube. Do you watch it?
CZ: I sometimes watch it before going to bed.
EA: There are various videos, right? Are there also videos of surfing and mountain climbing?
CZ: There are, but they all tend to look the same.
EA: When it's a video, that might be the case. It seems like there's a kind of fun that only those who are doing it can understand. Haha.

EA: That's right. I've seen ostriches and buffaloes coming in short videos.
CZ: Those are valuable videos worth watching.
EA: The idea of placing a camera in the desert is amazing.
CZ: I wonder who put it there. Maybe it's for observing wild animals.
EA: Speaking of observation systems, there are also images of Earth taken from space. Did you know that?
CZ: Yes, I've seen those. It was surprising.
EA: It's unbelievable that we can now see from space. The advancement of technology is amazing!
