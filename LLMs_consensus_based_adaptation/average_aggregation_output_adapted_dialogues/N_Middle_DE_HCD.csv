CR: I like to stay active, but I don't have a specific hobby.  
DE: Do you engage in any sports or exercise routines?  
CR: Yes, I do some gym training.  
DE: That sounds great! It's wonderful to hear. I used to go to the gym too, but I found it hard to keep up.  
CR: Having a clear goal can help with consistency.  
DE: True. I generally just walk my dog.  
CR: Walking a dog seems enjoyable.  
DE: It is, except when the weather is too hot or cold. But overall, it's pleasant.  
CR: Weather can indeed impact outdoor activities.  
DE: That's why the gym is convenient, right? No weather worries.  
CR: Correct, the gym's environment is stable year-round.  
DE: Do you use equipment like treadmills?  
CR: Yes, I run on the treadmill for about 30 minutes.  
DE: That's a healthy routine. I liked using treadmills with incline settings.  
CR: Incline settings can make workouts more challenging.  
DE: An incline really adds intensity; it's almost like hiking.  
CR: Walking with an incline can be tough.  
DE: How long do your gym sessions usually last?  
CR: I train for about 2 hours, twice a week.  
DE: That sounds sustainable and balanced. Good for you!

CR: Renting from the airport is convenient.  
DE: You can visit many places that way.

CR: Caffeine’s effects can vary.
DE: Coffee helps me avoid getting sleepy at work.
CR: Many drink coffee to stay alert, though its effectiveness varies.
DE: Are there people on whom caffeine works and those on whom it doesn't?
CR: It could be due to individual constitution.
DE: That might be the case. When I practiced the tea ceremony, the thick matcha was intense.
CR: Are you still interested in the tea ceremony?
DE: Yes, it's profound.
CR: A one-day trial course is an option.
DE: I think it's a good idea. It's better to check the classroom atmosphere before joining.
CR: What kind of atmosphere do you recommend?
DE: A classroom where I can enjoy wabi-sabi, without topics like illness coming up.
CR: Do such topics often come up?
DE: My previous classroom focused only on tea ceremony, but after moving to Tokyo, the new classroom was different.
CR: Is that why you quit?
DE: Yes, it was too different. I didn't want to quit, but...
