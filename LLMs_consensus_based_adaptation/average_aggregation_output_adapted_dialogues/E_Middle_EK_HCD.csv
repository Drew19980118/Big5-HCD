CN: Good evening! How can I assist you tonight?  
EK: Do you have any part-time job experience?  
CN: Yes, in places like restaurants and Uniqlo.  
EK: Uniqlo! I really like that place!  
CN: It was challenging, so I quit soon after starting.  
EK: Was it because you had to keep moving?  
CN: Yes, we couldn't walk slowly in front of customers.  
EK: Why did they have that rule?  
CN: To ensure efficient customer service.  
EK: I see. That makes sense.  
CN: It's meant to keep the service quick and the store tidy.  
EK: Though it makes it hard to talk to staff when they're rushing around.  
CN: True. A balance might be better.  
EK: I had a similar experience once.  
CN: Are there other rules like that which made it popular?  
EK: I worked at a moving company where we had to run while working.  
CN: That sounds exhausting!  
EK: It felt like training, though.  
CN: Did it affect your physical fitness?  
EK: Not much since I did strength training, but it helped.  
CN: Your muscles appreciated the effort?  
EK: In a way, yes.  
CN: That's interesting.  
EK: The muscle pain was intense but a nice memory.  
CN: It's fascinating how work preferences vary.  
EK: Exercise releases endorphins. What part-time job would you like to try?  
CN: I'd love to work at an art museum.  
EK: That sounds wonderful, being around art you love.

DQ: Hello! How can I assist you today?
EK: Did you go anywhere this summer?
DQ: I visited my parents' house and the nearby river.
EK: Is it a river? Do you swim in it?
DQ: The children were playing there, but the water was quite cold.
EK: Rivers are cold, aren't they? Is this a mountain stream?

EK: I love dogs too! I don't have one, but I've always wanted one someday!
DQ: If you were to have a pet, do you have any preferences?
EK: I'd like a Shiba Inu.
DQ: Shiba Inus are very cute, and there are smaller ones like Mameshiba!
EK: It's cute, isn't it? The fact that I am often away from home is a drawback.
DQ: It might be tough for your pet if you are frequently away.
EK: That's right. It's easy to start keeping a pet.
DQ: Certainly. I haven't been able to go out much either... just for shopping.
EK: That happens, doesn't it? A large dog, huh. Your home must be lively!
DQ: It's lively! By the way, we also have one cat.
EK: Oh! It's just like the Mutsugoro Kingdom! That's nice.
DQ: The children love animals too, and it feels like a little pet therapy.

BT: Hello. Good morning.  
EK: Summer is almost over. Did you go anywhere this summer?  
BT: Actually, I haven't done much. I've been watching streams.  
EK: I see. Do you not go out often?  
BT: Yes. I usually stay indoors. I don't mind staying home all the time.  
EK: I see. Are you fine even if you don't go out much?  
BT: I do go shopping and visit museums every few months.  
EK: Is it an art museum? Like paintings?  
BT: Yes, I like paintings and sculptures.  
EK: That's interesting! I went to a museum recently, but I didn't know how to appreciate the art.  
BT: A book I read suggested carefully observing everything.  
EK: Is it okay if I interpret it as I like?  
BT: Yes, it's fine to decide based on your preferences and discuss your thoughts with the person you went with.  
EK: Is that okay with you? Do you also draw?  
BT: I do some design work, but it's not traditional painting.  
EK: That's impressive! Are you a professional?  
BT: No, it's nothing special. It's embarrassing.  
EK: Is everything digital nowadays?  
BT: I work digitally, doing coloring for CG.  
EK: That sounds complex.  
BT: By the way, what did you see at the museum?  
EK: I'm not sure what I saw. I remember Van Gogh and Monet.  
BT: That's amazing. Is the person you went with a fan of paintings?  
EK: I love my partner! I also draw, so I look at those.  
BT: Wow. Your partner seems knowledgeable.  
EK: No, I'm just figuring it out. But drawing is wonderful.  
BT: I see. People who draw often undervalue themselves because they're surrounded by other artists.  
EK: Certainly! It can be hard to know the right answer.  
BT: Make sure to tell your partner how amazing they are! Hehe.",1,15,15,15,15

EK: I like carbonated water. As a result, it's also healthy!  
BT: Understood. Are you using a home machine for carbonation, or do you purchase them?  
EK: I am currently buying them one by one! I drink about two 1.5-liter bottles a day.  
BT: That's quite a lot.  
EK: There are empty plastic bottles everywhere. When it comes to cold things, it's ice cream, right? Do you eat it often?  
BT: I don't eat ice cream very much. Maybe once or twice a month.
