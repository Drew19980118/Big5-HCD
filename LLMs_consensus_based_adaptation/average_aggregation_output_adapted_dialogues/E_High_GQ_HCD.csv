GQ: Yes, two and a half hours each way, plus some relaxed driving time.  
GL: Got it. How was the traffic?  
GQ: On the way back, there was a traffic jam on the highway, so I took a side road.

GL: I do light yoga at home after a bath and before bed.  

GQ: Did you use YouTube as a reference?  
GL: Yes, I search for the body parts I want to stretch and do simple routines.  

GQ: I tried it a bit when I had more time at home during COVID.  
GL: My motivation also started during time at home. A yoga mat helped.  

GQ: I considered buying a yoga mat but decided not to.  
GL: I bought inexpensive items on sale and sometimes do it on the bed before sleep.  

GQ: Do you think buying tools helps maintain the habit? I find it challenging to stick with it.  
GL: It's mostly light stretching. Intense routines can be tough.  

GQ: Have you thought about trying hot yoga?

GL: You need to take it slow to avoid injury. Consistency is key.  

GQ: I might look up the simple routine introduced on NHK and start again.  
GL: Please do. Yoga can be done gradually without pressure.

GQ: I understand the feeling. It's important.  
GL: Making the most of what you bought can motivate you.

GD: Do you often have hot pot?
GQ: Yes, about once a week, even in summer.
GD: What ingredients do you use?
GQ: Similar to other seasons.
GD: Hot weather can make you feel colder.

GQ: Sometimes, but mostly I make broth from kelp.
GD: Is it ponzu?
GQ: Yes, we use a lot of ponzu sauce.
GD: It’s convenient.
GQ: Yes, and children like it too.
GD: Is ponzu popular with kids?
GQ: Our family uses ponzu. I like mayonnaise more.
GD: Wasn’t mayonnaise more acidic in the past?
GQ: Yeah, I think so.
GD: My husband disliked mayo because it was sour, but now he found non-sour ones.
GQ: Mayonnaise is quite useful.
GD: There are more varieties now.
GQ: Definitely! I mix it with eggs for omelettes.
GD: I put it directly on steamed vegetables.
GQ: Mayo on omelettes makes cooking easier. Try it!
GD: I will! Stir-frying vegetables with mayonnaise is tasty.
GQ: I haven’t tried that yet. I will.
GD: Fried rice becomes delicious when you burn some mayonnaise and stir-fry it.",7,15,15,15,15
6,"GQ: Good morning.
GD: Good morning! How can I assist you today?
GQ: Do you have any pets?
GD: I used to have a rabbit.
GQ: I had one too. What kind was it?
GD: Mine was a lop-eared rabbit.
GQ: Mine was a Nether mix with ears that stood up.
GD: Did it grow bigger because it was a mix?
GQ: Yes, but it wasn’t troublesome.
GD: Rabbits are a manageable size.
GQ: I have a dog and a cat now. A rabbit would be easier.
GD: Managing multiple pets can be demanding. Is it challenging?
GQ: Yes, the cost of food is high. We have one dog and sometimes two cats.
GD: That can get expensive. How do you manage it?
GQ: We originally had dogs outside, and a cat settled in.
GD: Did it come for the dog’s food?
GQ: Yes, it ended up being raised on the dog's milk.
GD: Was it separated from its mother?
GQ: It seems so, but my dog hasn’t given birth.
GD: That could be maternal instinct.
GQ: It’s fascinating how that works across species.
GD: Indeed. Do you see this behavior in other pets?
GQ: Other cats come and go, but this one has always stayed with us.
GD: Does it go outside often?
GQ: Yes, it goes out to play since we keep the dog in the garage.
GD: It’s good that it knows where home is. Do you buy its food?
GQ: Yes, I buy dry food. Price increases are challenging.

GD: You’re welcome in advance.  
GQ: ""It's the season of good appetite, but are you thinking about dieting?""  
GD: Yes, I think about it often since I am above my ideal weight, but I find it challenging to stay motivated.  
GQ: Thinking, sluggishly, comrades.  
GD: Yay. I'm not very good at exercising and have trouble keeping up with walking.  
GQ: How about radio exercises to help with your waistline?  
GD: They don't significantly change my body shape, but they do improve my blood circulation and help me feel more awake.  
GQ: That sounds like a good approach for overall health!  
GD: Yes, I have experienced reduced shoulder stiffness and lower back pain.  
GQ: I started using my child’s bowl to eat less, but I keep getting seconds, which defeats the purpose.  
GD: It’s hard to resist second helpings of freshly cooked rice.  
GQ: The food has become so enjoyable that I find it hard to stop.  
GD: I understand. Even when I ask for suggestions, I end up cooking what I want to eat.  
GQ: Exactly! I'm always trying to think of what to make for meals.  
GD: It’s tough when there are no specific cravings or ideas.  
GQ: My child often asks for hamburgers. It’s difficult without them.  
GD: It’s challenging when the fridge isn’t empty, but there are no meal ideas.  
GQ: I saw on TV that planning the weekly menu during the weekend is a good idea, but we only did it for two weeks.  
GD: Did you find it helpful to plan ahead?  
GQ: ""Yes, we organized it with Japanese, Western, and Chinese styles.""  
GD: Did it become easier to cook as a result?  
GQ: Sometimes I ran out of time and the schedule got messy, making it difficult.  
GD: As expected, plans don’t always go smoothly. Planning for three days might be more realistic.  
GQ: That’s true, three days seems more manageable.  
GD: A week can feel long, and ingredients might not stay fresh.  
GQ: Planning for three days at a time seems practical.  
GD: Deciding on a menu within that time frame could work well.  
GQ: I think I will give it a try.  
GD: I think I’ll try it too!",1,15,15,15,15
