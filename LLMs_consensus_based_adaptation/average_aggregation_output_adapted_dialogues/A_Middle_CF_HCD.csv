1,"CF: Good evening!  
BW: Good evening. It has been hot every day. Are you feeling alright?  
CF: Thanks for asking! Other than dealing with cavities, everything's fine.  
BW: I have a cavity too. I need to go to the dentist soon.  
CF: I'm not a fan of dentists, but at the end of June, the pain was so bad I decided to go.  
BW: I also dislike it. I usually wait until it's absolutely necessary.  
CF: It's a hassle to go for regular check-ups after the treatment.  
BW: Recently, it takes a long time for dentists to complete treatments, and check-ups are also challenging, aren't they?  
CF: I see. I have several cavities, so I'll be visiting the dentist for a while, which I don't enjoy.  
BW: I went for treatment two years ago but stopped after the major concern was addressed.  
CF: I understand! I did the same about three years ago.  
BW: Even after getting better, issues can return. I want to find a dentist that suits me.  
CF: That's true. There are so many dentists, it's hard to choose a good one.  
BW: There are many, and reviews can help, but you won't know until you visit.  
CF: Reviews can be different from the actual experience.  
BW: Even popular places might not suit everyone.  
CF: I understand! That happened with my last dentist!  
BW: It's difficult. Fixing an issue can sometimes create more problems, like food getting stuck.  
CF: That's annoying! I feel like complaining.  
BW: My friend said it was tough because of sensitivity from correcting a gap in their front teeth.  
CF: Braces can cause sensitivity and are expensive, aren't they?  
BW: That's right. They didn't get much response when reporting it, which was unfortunate.  
CF: Dentists are generally expensive, so unexpected issues are frustrating.  
BW: If something seems off, it should be handled properly.  
CF: That's true, but it's hard to say it.  
BW: My friend couldn't say it immediately and communicated it later.  
CF: I see. Were they able to respond?  
BW: They did, but for an additional fee.  
CF: An additional fee! That makes me uneasy. Thanks for the info!  
BW: You're welcome. Thank you very much!",1
2,"CF: Good evening!
BW: Hello. Do you exercise regularly?
CF: No, not really.
BW: I haven't been exercising much either.
CF: I tried water walking at the municipal pool and planned to go weekly.
BW: Is it a good workout?
CF: Yes, it is. I walk in the 50m pool and sometimes do flutter kicks.
BW: Can you still swim normally?
CF: I used to do both crawl and breaststroke, but I’m unsure now.
BW: Is the pool crowded in the evening?
CF: It's less crowded since it’s open until around 9 PM.
BW: Do they have separate areas for swimming and walking?
CF: Yes, that’s convenient.
BW: It's challenging to exercise regularly.
CF: It takes determination.
BW: It's tough without a goal. I stretch at home sometimes.
CF: That’s practical. I stretch when I’ve been on the computer for a long time.
BW: Your body gets stiff from long computer use.
CF: Yes, it affects blood flow.
BW: My shoulders and lower back hurt too. I want to exercise more.
CF: Isn't it hard to find time when you're busy?
BW: Yes, it often gets postponed.
CF: I understand.
BW: Using an app might help maintain a routine.
CF: Smartwatches and smartphones can help.
BW: It’s convenient to use technology.
CF: I monitor my sleep time with my smartphone daily.
BW: You can track sleep and heart rate.
CF: It’s very convenient. Goodbye.
BW: Goodbye.",9
3,"CF: Good evening! Nice to meet you.  
BW: Nice to meet you. Have you been interested in anything recently?  
CF: Yes, I’ve recently gotten back into casual cycling.  
BW: What is pottering? It's the first time I've heard of it.  
CF: It means aimlessly wandering around on a bicycle. It's quite enjoyable.  
BW: Do you prefer exploring the city or nature?  
CF: I tend to prefer exploring the city. There are many interesting videos on YouTube about it.  
BW: I’ll check it out on YouTube. Urban exploration does seem fun.  
CF: I enjoy watching pottering videos, especially those in Shibuya.  
BW: That sounds intriguing. Thank you for sharing.  
CF: No problem at all. Is there anything you’ve been passionate about recently?  
BW: I’ve been practicing the ukulele again after a long break.  
CF: That's great! Can you play the ukulele?  
BW: I used to play a long time ago. Videos inspired me to start again.  
CF: Playing and singing at the same time must be fun! What songs are you practicing?  
BW: Hawaiian songs and some Western songs.  
CF: That sounds really cool.  
BW: I’m still working on it. Do you listen to music?  
CF: Yes, I enjoy Japanese music and game soundtracks.  
BW: What about recent game soundtracks?  
CF: Mostly soundtracks from games I played in the past.  
BW: Like Dragon Quest or Mario?  
CF: Yes, and also Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger.  
BW: Final Fantasy music is well-known.  
CF: Yes, I've always liked it.  
BW: Game music is wonderful. Koichi Sugiyama from Dragon Quest passed away recently.  
CF: He was a remarkable person. I hope his legacy continues.  
BW: Indeed, games and game music are a significant part of Japan's culture.  
CF: I agree. Thank you for the conversation!  
BW: Thank you as well.",1

BQ: Are you doing anything for disaster prevention?
CF: Just some stockpiles.
BQ: We should prepare stockpiles.
CF: Some cookies can be stored for five years.
BQ: Some can be rehydrated with water and seem delicious.
CF: Recent ones are well-made. I’d like to try them.
BQ: Important to get used to the taste. Hope we never need them.
CF: True. Earthquakes might be scarier.
BQ: Another big earthquake is predicted.
CF: I think every year ""This year will come!"" but my stockpile is not enough.

BQ: Thank you.",6
5,"CF: Good morning.

BQ: Do you like hot springs?
CF: Yes, I do! I used to visit super sento often.
BQ: Super sento is very comfortable, and you can spend an entire day there.
CF: Exactly. There are now places that look like manga cafes.
BQ: Noted. I liked taking naps in theater rooms.
CF: I agree. It’s very relaxing.
BQ: The food is delicious there, like ramen.
CF: Exactly. Snacks and beer are good too.
BQ: Many people enjoy these after a bath.
CF: That could easily be me!
BQ: Some places allow you to stay overnight.
CF: I haven't stayed overnight, but it would be useful if you miss the last train.
BQ: That makes sense. Thank you for the information.
CF: If I miss the last train and need to stay somewhere, I’d prefer a super sento.
BQ: Manga cafes are smaller and only have showers.
CF: True. It’s best to go home if possible.
BQ: Do you usually commute by train?
CF: No, I work from home.
BQ: Working from home sounds convenient. Thank you for sharing.
CF: You’re welcome. Take care!",4
6,"CF: Good morning. Do you wake up early and stay active in the morning?

BQ: I like sweet tamagoyaki. How can I make it look good?
CF: It’s tricky to wrap it perfectly.
BQ: Is there a bento side dish you’re confident in?
CF: Hamburger steak and kinpira.

BQ: Thank you!",5
7,"CF: Good morning. I'm considering buying something I want since payday is next week.  
BQ: Good morning. Thank you for your hard work. What are you thinking of buying?  
CF: I want a display that can connect to my computer.  
BQ: Displays are a great choice. There are many types available.  
CF: I want to connect it to my laptop for dual screens.  
BQ: A multi-display setup can boost work efficiency.  
CF: I also want to watch videos while working.  
BQ: That sounds nice. I'm looking to add another display too, but it's hard to choose.  
CF: Yes, it's challenging with so many options.  
BQ: I'm interested in a monitor arm.  
CF: He seems very impressive.  
BQ: I want to move the monitor around a lot. I'm considering a Japanese-made one, but even the used ones are pricey.  
CF: That's quite a cost. It's something to think about.  
BQ: I've heard that good monitors reduce eye strain. Higher prices usually mean better performance.  
CF: I didn't know that.  
BQ: It's important to be mindful of eye health with prolonged computer use.  
CF: I agree. I got blue light blocking glasses.  
BQ: How effective are blue light blocking glasses?  
CF: They're like lightly tinted sunglasses.  
BQ: Is there a noticeable difference when you're not wearing them?  
CF: Yes, the brightness is different.  
BQ: Does it feel darker?  
CF: Yes, compared to regular glasses, you can really tell the difference.  
BQ: I see. I'll consider getting them as well.  
CF: Sure! The only drawback is they might reflect blue light from certain angles.  
BQ: That might look cool but could be distracting.  
CF: Kids often react to them with ""Wow!""  
BQ: Like the Terminator?  
CF: It looks that way! I couldn't help but laugh. Thanks for the chat!  
BQ: Thank you very much.",1
