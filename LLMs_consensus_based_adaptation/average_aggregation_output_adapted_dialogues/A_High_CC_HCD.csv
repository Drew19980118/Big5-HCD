BL: Nice to meet you.  
CC: Have you done anything summery recently?  
BL: I played with water in the bath.  
CC: That sounds fun! Do you have children?  
BL: Yes, I put her in a swimsuit.  
CC: So, no trips to the sea or pool, right?  
BL: We can go to the pool this year, but it feels unsafe.  
CC: Is that because of the coronavirus?  
BL: Yes, due to COVID-19, I haven't been to a pool.  
CC: That makes sense. It can be intimidating.  
BL: It's best to get used to it when young. I can't swim either.  
CC: I wasn't great at it either. But walking by the beach recently made me want to swim.  
BL: If you can swim in the sea, that's impressive.  
CC: I'm not sure if I still can, though.  
BL: If you could swim before, you should be okay.  
CC: I think I can manage. I haven't swum since becoming an adult.  
BL: Even if you go to the sea, you'd likely stay on the beach.  
CC: Probably. I might not have ridden a bike in 10 years.  
BL: 10 years is long! I could ride normally after a few years.  
CC: I think I can ride, but riding on the road makes me nervous.  
BL: True. It's scary where there are many cars.  
CC: I get anxious seeing bikes on the road and the sidewalk.  
BL: Separated sidewalks for bikes and pedestrians might be safer.  
CC: Yes, that would help.  
BL: More separated sidewalks would be reassuring.  
CC: At Kawasaki Station, I was surprised by the bike sections.  
BL: Some places are more advanced depending on the region.  
CC: I think so.  
BL: Hopefully, more areas will improve.",9,15,15,15,15

BR: Hello! How can I assist you today?
CC: It's my pleasure. Do you do any exercise?
BR: Recently, I haven't been doing much. Just walking and doing sit-ups.
CC: Great. Did you go for walks frequently?
BR: Yes, before it got hot, I used to walk for more than an hour a day.
CC: You walk quite a bit, don't you? Does it not really matter unless you walk for an hour?
BR: The effect starts to show after about 20 minutes.
CC: Oh, really?
BR: Do you do any exercise?
CC: Not really, but it sounds lovely to take a walk along the river near my house.
BR: The river is close. Walking there might be refreshing.
CC: Recently, the heat is one thing, but the strong wind is also a bit scary.
BR: Is the wind strong? Is the river quite wide?
CC: I think it's spacious. Also, the sea is relatively close.
BR: The wind seems strong. My location is more on the mountain side, so it's not that wide.
CC: Then, is the current swift?
BR: No, it's quite calm and soothing to watch.
CC: That's nice. You can watch water flowing forever, can't you?
BR: Yes, I enjoy watching from the bridge.
CC: My eyes have been flickering a lot lately. Haha.
BR: On sunny days, it can be tough without shade on the bridge.
CC: The wind on the bridge is also really strong, isn't it?
BR: Here, it's not that much, so it's alright.
CC: I see. On windy days, the bridge sways.
BR: Really? That's quite different from upstream and downstream!
CC: Yes! I would like to go on an adventure from the uppermost stream of the river to the sea at least once. Any suggestions for routes or activities?
BR: River rafting is an option. Exploring different parts of the river sounds like a great adventure.
CC: I remember seeing an advertisement for that kind of experience before. I'm interested.
BR: There are companies that organize such trips. Let me know if you need assistance planning it.",4,15,15,15,15
