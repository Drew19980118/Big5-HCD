BQ: Yes, it's Kenji-kun.
BJ: I saw it when it was first released. Was it interesting?
BQ: I also saw it in the theater and wanted to watch it again, so it was interesting.
BJ: It's nostalgic. If it's between Japanese and Western movies, is it Japanese movies?

BJ: Oh, then U-NEXT is good. It has a lot of Japanese movies.
BQ: There are more works compared to other subscriptions, even though it's more expensive.
BJ: Yes, it will be cheaper if you share with your friends.
BQ: I didn't know that something like share exists.
BJ: I think up to four people can participate. The monthly fee can also be divided into four parts.
BQ: That's a good deal. Can you also read magazines?
BJ: Yes, including manga. Though you mostly need points for them.
BQ: I see. Are you subscribed to any other services?
BJ: I am subscribed to Netflix and Amazon.

BJ: Sounds good. That's the classic choice.  
BQ: What will you put on?  
BJ: I also prefer sauce, but I've started to enjoy it with salt recently.  
BQ: You are a true connoisseur. As for me, I prefer to eat grilled meat with salt.
