DG: Absolutely listening!
BA: Have you heard of Justin Bieber?
DG: I have, but I don't know the song titles. He's famous, right?
BA: Yes, he is quite famous.
DG: It's difficult to attend live concerts recently. Have you ever been to one?
BA: I have attended concerts, but it was quite a while ago.
DG: Amazing! I have the impression that it's not easy to see international artists.
BA: It is quite easy to purchase tickets online. Did you attend a live show recently?
DG: No, I am planning to attend Summer Sonic for the first time in a while.
BA: Isn't Summer Sonic coming up soon?
DG: Next week. I'm concerned if everyone will be able to go out because of COVID-19.
BA: I wonder which overseas artists will perform.
DG: THE19 somehow!
BA: I do not recognize that artist.
DG: I have always been bad with historical eras and got confused.
BA: Are you referring to era names?

2,"DG: Nice to meet you!  
DV: Hello, nice to meet you.  
DG: Anything interesting lately?  
DV: Watching quiz shows at home.  
DG: Quiz shows seem educational.  
DV: Good for brain activity.  
DG: Even elementary school problems can be tough.  
DV: True, many forget school material.  
DG: I worry about that too.  
DV: Concern about my child learning faster.  
DG: That must be stressful.  
DV: If told ""You don't get this?"" it would be surprising.  
DG: I'd feel anxious and study more.  
DV: We forget things we don't use.  
DG: True. Favorite subject?  
DV: Mathematics.  
DG: Opposite for me.  
DV: I liked clear answers.  
DG: Math fans say that.  
DV: Language subjects are ambiguous.  
DG: Different perspectives.  
DV: Many ""not wrong, but..."" situations.  
DG: I liked reading books.  
DV: I enjoyed reading too.  
DG: I wasn't good at classical literature.  
DV: Classical Japanese was tough.  
DG: Kanji drills bored me. Interesting materials now.  
DV: Yes, various drills available.  
DG: They seem useful, according to my friend.  
DV: I need to buy some for the kids soon.",12,15,15,15,15
3,"DG: Hello!  
DV: Hello! How can I assist you today?  
DG: What time does ""good evening"" start?  
DV: ""Good evening"" typically starts around 5 PM or 6 PM.  
DG: Oh, I hadn't thought of it that way!  
DV: It's often linked to the evening news.  
DG: It's always just ""hello"" overseas.  
DV: Japanese has more specific greetings, which can be challenging.  
DG: True, it's intricate and challenging for those learning.  
DV: Different ways of speaking can change impressions.  
DG: There are too many homophones. It can be overwhelming!  
DV: Yes, homophones make Japanese difficult for learners.  
DG: I was pleased when I was told my Japanese sounded clear over the phone while abroad.  
DV: That must have been nice.  
DG: I stayed with a host family in Australia.  
DV: That sounds interesting. Could you share more?  
DG: As an only child, it was refreshing to have siblings around.  
DV: Was it a long-term or short-term stay?  
DG: It was throughout high school. I felt quite homesick.  
DV: Homesickness is common during long stays.  
DG: Yes, and the different food made me feel lonely.  
DV: Did you miss Japanese food?  
DG: Yes, I missed Japanese food, especially fish. It was mostly meat there.  
DV: Is it true that Australia has more meat dishes?  
DG: Yes, there was a lot of beef and lamb steak.  
DV: Aussie beef and lamb steak are popular.  
DG: Since they are low in fat, I lost some weight when I got back!  
DV: That's healthy but can be less satisfying.  
DG: Yes, it was a bit dry but interesting.  
DV: Thank you for sharing your experience.",10,15,15,15,15
4,"DG: Hello, please.
DV: ""I look forward to assisting you.""
DG: Do you have any favorite artists or celebrities?
DV: When I was young, I liked GLAY.
DG: It's nostalgic! I wonder if they're still doing live performances.
DV: GLAY performs in Hokkaido occasionally.
DG: I see, it's nice to have a local focus.
DV: They held a large concert in Hokkaido before.
DG: Do you go to live concerts?
DV: I prefer watching DVDs.
DG: That might be more comfortable that way.
DV: The excitement at live concerts can be overwhelming.
DG: Each artist has quite a distinct style, don't they?
DV: I once attended a female artist's concert and was surprised by the crowd's enthusiasm.
DG: Is it the passion of men?
DV: Both men and women create an incredible atmosphere.
DG: It's like an idol thing, right? I'm not really good with that kind of stuff.
DV: I feel out of place sometimes, so I stick to DVDs.
DG: I once went to a Yuzu concert unexpectedly and couldn't keep up with the atmosphere.
DV: Yuzu's concerts do not typically have loud, screaming fans.
DG: They are really skillful, but I was amazed by their energetic performance!
DV: Many live performances are high-energy.
DG: I'd like to attend something where I can sit and listen calmly.
DV: Live performances where one can sit are appealing.
DG: I am not good with the pressure of having to stand up. Participation is voluntary!
DV: If everyone around is standing, it's difficult to remain seated.
DG: Even if I'm cheering and enjoying it.
DV: Watching a DVD might be more suitable.
DG: Ahaha, it might be perfect given the times.
DV: That's correct!",4,15,15,15,15
5,"DG: Hello!
DV: Hello!
DG: It's hot, and I feel like going to the aquarium.

DG: A child got bitten at the beach.
DV: Dolphins can be dangerous.
DG: They are strong.

DG: How did they feel?
DV: Smooth.
DG: Interesting, they look muscular.
DV: There was a feeding experience, but I missed it.
DG: I'd love to try that.
DV: It was memorable.
DG: I like watching the shark tank to cool off.
DV: Some sharks are gentle.
DG: I like hammerhead sharks. Their head shape is fascinating!
DV: The square-shaped one?
DG: Yes! My friends call them vacuum cleaners.
DV: That's funny!
DG: Yes, it's cute.
DV: My child likes whale sharks.
DG: Whale sharks are big and gentle. I've never seen one in real life.

6,"DG: Nice to meet you!
DV: Hello, nice to meet you.
DG: I haven't been going out much recently and haven't bought any new clothes. Have you bought any?
DV: I bought pants online.
DG: Online shopping has definitely increased. I usually buy from Uniqlo.
DV: You can adjust the length by cutting the hem yourself.
DG: Really? I didn't know they offered that service.
DV: The material doesn't fray when you cut it, so you can do it yourself.
DG: That's convenient and useful.
DV: Since I'm not very tall, the hems are usually too long for me.
DG: I also hate when hems get dirty.
DV: Rainy days are especially bad.
DG: That's true. Only the hem gets dirty.
DV: I used to wear heels and high-heeled boots.
DG: Lately, I've been wearing more comfortable shoes.
DV: I wear sneakers a lot, and hem length is something I always notice.
DG: There are many sporty sneakers and sandals available.
DV: That's when I found out about pants you can hem yourself.
DG: There are many innovative products out there.
DV: I bought them immediately.
DG: It's nice when you find exactly what you need.
DV: The fabric was suitable for the season.
DG: I feel like shopping for clothes now.
DV: I bought another pair in a different color.
DG: Now I have high expectations.
DV: I'm planning to wear these pants a lot this summer.
DG: I've been wearing skirts a lot, so I'll look for some pants.
DV: You can find them if you search. Recommended.
DG: Thank you.
DV: You're welcome.",3,15,15,15,15
7,"DG: Good evening!
DV: Good evening!
DG: I've been staying up late recently. Should I go to bed early?
DV: When putting the child to sleep, I often fall asleep unintentionally.
DG: Having a family around seems to help establish that rhythm!
DV: I aim to put them to bed at 9 PM, and they usually fall asleep around that time.
DG: That's fast! It must be good for the skin!
DV: However, I wish for some personal time after the kids go to bed.
DG: I understand. Finding time for yourself must be challenging.
DV: The TV channels are mostly occupied by the kids.
DG: Moms need some TV time too!
DV: I would like some leisure time to watch TV.
DG: That sounds nice. How would you spend a free day?
DV: I might go shopping leisurely or just relax.
DG: As a single person, it seems like being a parent can be tough.
DV: From the moment a child is born, free days become rare and it can be challenging.
DG: Right, maintaining friendships after becoming a mother must be hard.
DV: Yes, it's quite difficult to go out without the kids, and taking them along can be challenging too.
DG: I hear time slots and choices change drastically after having kids.
DV: Dining out tends to be at places suitable for children.
DG: Choosing a restaurant can be difficult.
DV: We often eat where the children prefer, so we don't visit Italian places much.
DG: So it ends up being family restaurant chains, right?
DV: Yes, it usually is.
DG: I should enjoy spicy foods while I still can.
DV: Conveyor belt sushi can be great for kids, but mine doesn't eat sushi.
DG: There are always preferences and allergies.
DV: Eat as much of what you like as you can while you still can!
DG: I'll follow your advice. Let's have mapo tofu!
DV: That sounds great!",2,15,15,15,15
8,"DG: Nice to meet you.
DV: Thank you.
DG: It's hot today.
DV: Yes, it makes me sweat.
DG: The outside temperature is 40 degrees.
DV: 40 degrees? Like a bath.
DG: Did you have lunch?
DV: I ate ramen.
DG: Ramen on a hot day? What does it taste like?
DV: Handmade soy sauce flavor.
DG: Handmade soy sauce? Good for summer!
DV: Lots of onions.
DG: Thinly sliced?
DV: Yes, and finely chopped green onions.
DG: I love green onions.
DV: Good for summer fatigue.
DG: I always eat instant noodles.
DV: Homemade is healthier.
DG: Cup noodles have a lot of salt.
DV: Yes, they do.
DG: Spicy food makes me feel heavy.
DV: Homemade lets you use more vegetables.
DG: I'm thinking of having noodles tonight.
DV: Smooth food is good without appetite.
DG: Rice and bread require effort.
DV: Noodles with meat and vegetables don't need side dishes.
DG: Convenient on one plate.
DV: Recommended for summer nights.
DG: I'll refer to it.
DV: Yes.",2,15,15,15,15
9,"DG: Hello!
DV: Hello! How can I assist you today?
DG: Lately, I've been spending a lot of time at home and becoming less active.
DV: That’s understandable. A lack of physical activity can indeed lead to weight gain and other health issues.
DG: Do you do any gymnastics or yoga?
DV: I haven't started anything yet, though it's often recommended.
DG: I've experienced this before. I watch the videos, but that's the end of it.
DV: Many people find it hard to follow through with exercise videos.
DG: DVDs were popular, right?
DV: Yes, a lot of people watched them once and then didn’t continue.
DG: Same here. Even though we have YouTube now, I just watch that and it's over.
DV: There are many options available, yet consistency remains a challenge.
DG: Yes, I did something like simple stretches before bed for a week, was satisfied with that, and forgot about it the following week.
DV: It’s common to start simple routines but difficult to maintain them.
DG: Yes, yes, but it doesn't last, right? I wonder how effective it is.
DV: Consistent routines, even if short, can be effective but maintaining them is key.
DG: I once registered at a gym, but I got better at making excuses.
DV: Many sign up for gyms but end up not using their memberships.
DG: It was quite expensive, and as infections increased, resistance emerged.
DV: With current health concerns, many are cautious about gym environments.
DG: Yes, there are also many older men who work out on machines while making quite a bit of noise.
DV: Exercising indoors while wearing a mask and maintaining distance can be worrisome.
DG: I think I'm gradually becoming more and more of a neat freak.
DV: Many people are more conscious about cleanliness and disinfecting frequently.
DG: That's right, I ended up buying a big spray.
DV: Excessive use of disinfectants can affect immunity over time.
DG: I also feel that a lot. I wonder which is better for small children.
DV: Children today have fewer opportunities to build their immunity naturally.
DG: Yes, that's right, there are so many disinfectants and antibacterial products here.
DV: It’s a widespread concern, and many hope the coronavirus situation improves soon.",4,15,15,15,15
10,"DG: Hello!
DV: Hello! How can I assist you today?
DG: Do you like coffee?
DV: I don’t have personal preferences, but many people enjoy drinking coffee in the morning.
DG: Morning coffee is nice, isn't it? I end up drinking too much.
DV: Consuming coffee in the morning is quite common. People often drink a PET bottle-sized coffee.
DG: Right, black? Do you like it sweet?
DV: Preferences vary, but black coffee is popular among many.
DG: Oh! I can tell you really like coffee!
DV: Black coffee is often considered to provide the purest coffee experience.
DG: Is it always a pet? Do you buy beans?
DV: People sometimes buy beans, but some find it more convenient to switch to other options over time.
DG: I see, I'm currently debating whether to buy a machine or not.
DV: Coffee machines, including those that use capsules, can be convenient.
DG: Oh, was it Nespresso? I think I've seen the booth.
DV: Nespresso is a popular brand. It is convenient but requires some maintenance.
DG: Is that so? Are there quite a lot of parts to wash?
DV: Yes, there are parts that need to be washed and some that do not. It can be a bit of a hassle.
DG: I see. There was quite a line at the booth so I couldn't do the tasting, but I thought it was cool.
DV: Many find it appealing, but it may become less convenient with time.
DG: Oh, I might have seen a future where the same thing happens.
DV: It might be due to a preference for iced coffee.
DG: Is it difficult to make ice cream with that machine?
DV: It involves extracting coffee over a large amount of ice.
DG: Ah, it looks a bit troublesome. I'm worried.
DV: For customer service, such machines might be useful.
DG: Certainly, it seems like it would be appreciated, but it seems impractical for everyday use.
DV: For personal use, choosing the more convenient option is advisable.
DG: I'm glad I asked! I think I'll reconsider!
DV: I'm glad the information was helpful.",1,15,15,15,15
