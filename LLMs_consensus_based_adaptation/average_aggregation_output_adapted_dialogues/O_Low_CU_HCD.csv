1,"CU: Hello!  
ED: Hello!  
CU: This summer was really hot, wasn't it?  
ED: Yes, it was very exhausting.  
CU: I went to an outdoor music festival last weekend and ended up with heatstroke.  
ED: Are you okay now?  
CU: After being in a place without shade for about five hours, I had a headache and nausea.  
ED: That must have been difficult.  
CU: Yes, I went to the infirmary by myself and felt better after resting for a while.  
ED: I'm glad you recovered. Was it during the daytime?  
CU: Yes, it was an event from morning until night, and I got tired during the day.  
ED: I see. The enthusiasm of the venue probably made it feel even hotter.  
CU: Yes, the crowd made it easy to forget about COVID-19. Did you go anywhere?  
ED: At the end of July, I went to Karuizawa.  
CU: Karuizawa? I've never been there. Is it really a nice place?  
ED: I thought it would be cool, but it was over 30 degrees.  
CU: Even Karuizawa is hot as expected. How did you spend your time?  
ED: There was my younger brother's wedding.  
CU: I see, congratulations. At which venue?  
ED: Thank you. It was at the Stone Church of Hoshino Resorts.  
CU: I know it! It's a beautiful chapel, isn't it?  
ED: Yes, it was very wonderful.  
CU: Since I was working in the bridal industry, I bet the food was delicious.  
ED: Yes, it was really delicious. I enjoyed it since I rarely go to Hoshino Resort.  
CU: I'm really jealous. I want to go there someday.  
ED: It was hotter than I expected, but it was a lovely place full of nature.  
CU: Since I live in the Kansai region, it's really difficult for me to go to Karuizawa.  
ED: I'm also from Kansai. It’s convenient to access from Tokyo.  
CU: So you're from Kansai too. It's easier to get there from Tokyo.  
ED: Yes. I made my way leisurely through Nagoya.",1,15,15,15,15
2,"CU: Thank you in advance.
ED: You're welcome!
CU: Have you picked up any new hobbies recently?
ED: Yes, I've been really into jigsaw puzzles lately.
CU: That sounds like a lot of fun! Are you working on a large one right now?
ED: It's a 1000-piece puzzle, so it's not too big, but it's still challenging.
CU: I bet it's really engaging. You must get completely absorbed in it.
ED: Definitely, sometimes I even forget to take breaks for meals.
CU: Do you have many completed puzzles at home?
ED: Yes, I have quite a few. I stopped displaying them after a while because there were too many.
CU: I've always wondered what to do with a jigsaw puzzle once it's completed.
ED: Do you enjoy doing jigsaw puzzles too?
CU: I’ve done a few in the past.
ED: Deciding what to do with a finished puzzle can be tricky. Lately, I’ve been taking them apart and storing them.
CU: I see. Isn't it a bit disappointing to dismantle a completed puzzle?
ED: I only keep the ones that I really love on display.
CU: That makes sense. I might start working on a puzzle again soon!
ED: It's a great way to pass the time, especially in a comfortable environment.
CU: It sounds like a wonderful hobby!
ED: Thank you! What have you been into recently?
CU: I've recently gotten into K-pop groups.
ED: Like BTS?
CU: Yes! I like BTS, but my current favorite is their brother group, TXT.
ED: K-pop is incredibly popular. A friend of mine is really into it too.
CU: It's trending! There are so many videos on YouTube that I lose track of time watching them.
ED: There are even K-pop dance schools now.
CU: Yes, I've heard that some of the neighbor's children attend them.
ED: An acquaintance’s child goes there and is really good at dancing.
CU: That’s amazing! They have a bright future ahead.
ED: I agree. Wishing them the best!",4,15,15,15,15

CU: July is the worst. Tough to manage.
ED: It must be challenging and hot.
CU: The Roomba fills up quickly.
ED: Pets are very comforting.

CU: Were you out somewhere?  
DN: Yes, I was out for work today.

CU: No, I usually leave around 8 o’clock.  
DN: That time is generally cooler than later.  
CU: Yes. Last week I attended an outdoor festival and got heatstroke.

CU: Many famous artists participate.

CU: Artists like Yuri and Motohiro Hata.  
DN: What kind of music do they play?  
CU: They play pop music. It was fun, but extremely hot.  
DN: Were you wearing a mask at the event?  
CU: Yes, although it wasn’t strictly enforced.  
DN: Managing the heat must have been difficult. Was it outdoors without cover?  
CU: Yes, it was under the sun. Umbrellas were prohibited, so I used a hat.  
DN: Did people collapse from the heat?  
CU: Yes, some did. The weather has been unusual.  
DN: Yes, it has. Did you have to stand the entire time?  
CU: I stood only for the artists I wanted to see. You should look it up if you get a chance.  
DN: Thank you for sharing. I'll look into it.",15,15,15,15,15

CU: Have you traveled anywhere recently?  
DN: I frequently visit the Kansai region on weekends.  
CU: That sounds interesting! Where do you go specifically?  
DN: Nishinomiya.  
CU: Any particular places you like there?  
DN: I study music and visit my son in Mita.  
CU: Is your work related to music?  
DN: No, but I'm aiming to become a musician.  
CU: That's cool! I play the piano myself.  
DN: I study the harpsichord.  
CU: The harpsichord has a lovely sound.  
DN: I enjoy playing Bach on it.  
CU: Do you have one at home?  
DN: Yes. What do you play on the piano?  
CU: I practice pieces by Chopin and Debussy.  
DN: They are challenging on the harpsichord.  
CU: I recently visited the Yamaha piano factory.  
DN: Shizuoka has many music-related places.

DN: Was it large?  
CU: No, it was small.  
DN: Yamaha also showcases harpsichords.  
CU: Are they expensive?  
DN: A Kawai harpsichord is around 2 million yen.

6,"CU: Good evening!
DN: Good evening. How can I assist you?
CU: Do you have dinner plans tonight?
DN: We will eat out tonight.
CU: Just the two of you?
DN: No, my college-aged son is home for the holidays, so the three of us will go out together.
CU: Do you know where you might go?
DN: Not yet, but it will be either shabu-shabu or yakiniku.
CU: Both are popular choices. Young people enjoy meat.
DN: Yes. I want my son to decide.
CU: Do you enjoy having your son visit?
DN: Yes, it’s reassuring to have him nearby.
CU: Sons often give their mothers peace of mind.
DN: Are your children living with you?
CU: Yes, they are in junior high school, so we are together. Thinking about them leaving someday makes me feel sad.
DN: That’s understandable. I used to be more independent, now I try to be less so.
CU: You must have been a strong mother.
DN: That was part of the problem. Seeing their weak mother, they feel they have to become strong.
CU: I see. I tend to be responsible too.
DN: Mothers often feel the need to be reliable for their sons.
CU: True, they think they have to raise strong children. But it can have the opposite effect.
DN: It seems so. A teacher said boys should value their pride.
CU: My mother-in-law says that too. She believes boys have high pride.
DN: Yes. For boys, pride is significant.
CU: Boys and girls are different.
DN: Yes. I need to show a bit of weakness.
CU: I understand. Since he's been reliable lately, I'll try to depend on him more.
DN: Yes. But if it's too much, it might be overwhelming.
CU: Balancing that is a process of trial and error.
DN: Yes. Keep trying.",10,15,15,15,15
