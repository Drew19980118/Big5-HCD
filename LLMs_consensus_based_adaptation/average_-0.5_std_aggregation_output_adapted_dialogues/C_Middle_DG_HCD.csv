DV: I thought it might be good for brain activation.  
DG: Definitely. Some of the questions can be really challenging.  
DV: I find it hard to recall things even after studying.  
DG: We all forget things we don't use often.  
DV: I worry my child might soon be smarter than me.  
DG: Kids can really push us to keep learning.

DG: That would be frustrating for sure.  
DV: We tend to forget things we don't use regularly.  
DG: Absolutely. What was your favorite subject?

DV: The Japanese language is indeed complex.  
DG: It's difficult because it's so detailed in various ways.

DV: There used to be an event to touch dolphins, and they felt smooth. I remember it well.  
DG: That sounds great! I wonder what it feels like.  
DV: Smooth to the touch. It was a unique experience.  
DG: I bet their muscles are strong because they can jump so high.  
DV: There was also a feeding experience, but the timing didn’t match. It's a shame.  
DG: I would love to try that.  
DV: It was memorable.  
DG: I like to cool off by watching the shark tank.  
DV: Sharks can be scary, but some are gentle. It’s fascinating.
