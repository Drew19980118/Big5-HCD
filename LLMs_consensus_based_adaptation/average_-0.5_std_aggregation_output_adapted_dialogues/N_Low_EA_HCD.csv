CP: Hello. Nice to meet you.  
EA: Do you have any hobbies?  
CP: I enjoy reading and swimming.  
EA: Reading is great! What kind of genres do you read?  
CP: Mainly mysteries.  
EA: Mystery! I like it too. I'm not very knowledgeable about it though.  
CP: Mysteries are fascinating. Which authors have you read?  
EA: A long time ago, a friend recommended it to me, so I read ""Everything Becomes F.""  
CP: Hiroshi Mori is the author. That book is quite popular.  
EA: I see! I didn't know it was something famous.  
CP: Mori's debut work, that series is very popular.  
EA: Hiroshi Mori is amazing! Is he writing anything else?  
CP: He has written many books. The Sky Crawlers series is also interesting.  
EA: Hmm, I'll make a note to read that next time.  
CP: The Sky Crawlers is more of a battle fantasy than a mystery.  
EA: Interesting, he writes various genres! Do you have any recommendations?  
CP: Recently, Masahiro Imamura's ""Murders at the House of Corpses"" is notable.  
EA: Ah, I might have seen that title at the bookstore.  
CP: It was very popular and was made into a movie.  
EA: I see, a movie adaptation! No wonder it sounded familiar.  
CP: Yes, the author has a series, and they are all interesting.  
EA: Masahiro Imamura, right? I'll remember that. By the way, did you watch the movie?  
CP: I watched it. The movie was also good.  
EA: Oh! I heard some adaptations deviate a lot from the original, but that was good!  
CP: The mystery element was stronger in the book, but the movie had a good atmosphere and was interesting.  
EA: It's hard to decide which one to watch first, isn't it? Should I start with the original work after all?  
CP: Yes, start with the original work.  
EA: Understood. My weekend plans just got more exciting!  
CP: I'm glad. Please share your thoughts once you've read it!",1,15,15,15,15

EA: I’m also far away, but I’d like to visit if I get a chance.
CP: By the way, when it comes to karaage, Oita is famous. Did you know that?
EA: I’ve heard of Oita’s karaage and toriten.
CP: Yes, and toriten as well. There are many take-out karaage shops.
EA: Looks like you won’t have any trouble with dinner!
CP: We no longer make fried chicken at home.
EA: Is it non-fried karaage?
CP: Excuse me, at home it is. At home.
EA: Ah, my mistake. I don’t cook much, so I didn’t think of frying at home.
CP: The taste varies from store to store, so it's fun to compare.
EA: Sounds good. I’d like to try different flavors.
CP: Everything is so delicious that I can’t rank them. If you go to Oita, definitely try them.",1,15,15,15,15
