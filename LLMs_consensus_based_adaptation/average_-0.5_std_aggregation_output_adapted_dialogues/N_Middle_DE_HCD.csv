DE: Before COVID, I used to go quite often. It’s fun to move my body to the music.

CR: Would a one-day trial course be a good starting point?  
DE: I think it's a great idea to check out the classroom atmosphere first.

DE: Look for a place where you can appreciate wabi-sabi without unrelated topics like illness.
