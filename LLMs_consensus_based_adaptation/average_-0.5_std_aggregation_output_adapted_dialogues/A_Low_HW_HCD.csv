1,"HW: Hello!  
CA: Hello!  
HW: What is your favorite food?  
CA: Ramen. I enjoy trying different places. How about you, <HW>?  
HW: I like sushi. What flavor of ramen do you like?  
CA: Soy sauce. Sushi is good too.  
HW: The soy sauce flavor is nice. I prefer hard thin noodles with a salt flavor.  
CA: Do you have any favorite stores?  
HW: The shio ramen at the restaurant called Afuri is delicious.  
CA: Is it a shop in Kanagawa?  
HW: It's probably available nationwide, including Kanagawa.  
CA: I might find one nearby.  
HW: Yes, it's recommended. For commercially available salt ramen, I recommend Raoh's yuzu salt flavor.  
CA: I'll check for Raoh's yuzu salt flavor at the store.  
HW: It's only sold during the hot pot season, so it might not be available in the summer.  
CA: A limited-time offer.  
HW: Yes, I think it would be great if they sold it all year round.  
CA: I'm craving shio ramen.  
HW: Shio ramen is light and delicious.  
CA: Visiting various ramen shops in Japan would be great.  
HW: I'd like to visit the top ramen shops in the national ranking someday.  
CA: That sounds interesting.  
HW: It seems that every store has a huge line, which might take a lot of time.  
CA: Are the top-ranked shops in places like Tokyo?  
HW: They are scattered across various prefectures.  
CA: So Tokyo is actually a branch?  
HW: The photo is published in ramen magazines and on collaboration ramen packages at convenience stores.  
CA: I see.  
HW: It's convenient to get collaboration products with famous ramen shops.  
CA: Certainly, let's talk again soon.  
HW: Yes, let's talk again.  ",2
2,"HW: Hello  
CA: Hello  
HW: What is your favorite drink?  
CA: I love coffee. As for alcohol, I like shochu and sake. How about you, <HW>?  
HW: I prefer non-caffeinated tea. I don't usually drink alcohol.  
CA: Black tea is also nice. And I'm very interested in non-caffeine!  
HW: For non-caffeinated drinks, I usually have decaf coffee, rooibos tea, or herbal teas.  
CA: I heard that too much caffeine is not good, so lately I've been thinking about cutting back on caffeine.  
HW: I have a weak stomach, so I limit my caffeine intake. Do you have any recommended ways to drink coffee?  
CA: I usually drink instant black coffee, but I recently found a new favorite way to enjoy it.  
HW: Can you tell me more about it?  
CA: I still like my coffee black, but I pair it with white chocolate.  
HW: That sounds delicious!  
CA: With sweetness, a milky taste, and white chocolate, it's enjoyable, so I recommend it.  
HW: White chocolate seems easier on the stomach. I'll try it next time.  
CA: However, caffeine really affects the stomach, doesn't it?  
HW: Yes, it does. Drinking coffee on an empty stomach in the morning hurts my stomach. But warm drinks are comforting.  
CA: My body is telling me.  
HW: Maybe it's just my stomach. Hahaha. Decaf means non-caffeine.  
CA: Decaf and non-caffeine have the same meaning!  
HW: I'll remember that. Non-caffeine is popular among pregnant women, people with insomnia, and people with weak stomachs like mine.  
CA: It's good for everyone.  
HW: It's good for your health and delicious, so I like it!  
CA: Speaking of which, this might be a change of subject, but by any chance, do you have a cat?  
HW: I have a cat allergy, so I can't keep a cat, but I love watching cat videos.  
CA: Oh, I see! The Slack icon was a cute cat, so it was soothing.  
HW: Cats are soothing, aren't they? I think cats with pink noses or wearing white socks are especially cute.  
CA: Just imagining it is healing.  
HW: The Mochineko channel on YouTube is recommended. Thank you very much! Let's talk again!  
CA: Is it Mochineko, Mochi-sama!? I love it too! Let's talk again!",1

HW: Once, as a child, I went to the public pool early in the morning, and it felt like I had it all to myself.

IM: Leftover curry from yesterday.  
HW: Curry is better the next day.  
IM: Yes, it is. Seafood curry could be nice too.

HW: It will go well. Just add the frozen seafood at the end.  
IM: I’ll try. Do you cook often?  
HW: I cook daily, but only usual dishes.  
IM: It’s impressive to make staple dishes with what you have.  
HW: I cook when needed and don’t enjoy it. Do you cook or bake?

HW: I want to make banana bread with bananas and pancake mix.  
IM: It sounds simple and delicious.  
HW: Yes, simple and delicious. I’ll make it again when butter prices drop.  
IM: Is butter expensive now?  
HW: Yes, ingredient prices are high due to the cost of living. Sometimes it’s cheaper to buy finished products.  
IM: I’ll buy finished products until it gets cheaper.

IM: Please reach out again.",5
5,"HW: Thank you.

HW: I'm watching anime. Any recommendations?
IM: Demon Slayer.
HW: Interesting. Did you watch the anime or read the manga?
IM: Both. Started with the anime.
HW: Both? That must have taken a lot of time. I've only watched the anime.
IM: It did, but I have no regrets!
HW: You're really into it! The animation was beautiful.
IM: Yes, the visuals were captivating. Do you watch anime often?
HW: The content is great. Do you have a favorite character?
IM: Tanjiro. I also watch Hanae-san's YouTube channel.
HW: Hanae-san has a nice voice. I'll check it out.
IM: My parent and I enjoyed it. But we're busy now.
HW: Watching videos takes time.
IM: Exactly. If I watch, I want to relax. Do you watch often?
HW: I binge-watch when I have time.
IM: Me too. I watch about two seasons.
HW: Binge-watching is fun. Do you eat anything while watching?
IM: Yes, potato chips are a must!
HW: What flavor do you like?
IM: Lightly salted, and limited editions.
HW: Many varieties exist. I recently had thick-cut ridged chips.
IM: Limited editions are tempting. I'll try thick-cut next. But chips make your hands dirty.
HW: True, you can't do other tasks.
IM: Yes, I accidentally touched my phone once.

IM: Yes, it is. Are you doing anything to cope with the heat?  
HW: I've been using a cool towel that gets chilly when wet.  
IM: I also use a cool towel. What is a cool ring?  
HW: A cooling ring freezes below 28°C and doesn't wet clothes.  
IM: That sounds convenient for keeping clothes dry.  
HW: Cool towels can make the neck area wet, but cool rings don't.  
IM: Wet clothes and carrying bulky drinks are concerns.  
HW: Summer involves carrying a lot of items.  
IM: Carrying a lot of luggage is troublesome, especially by train.  
HW: Compact luggage would be helpful, but carrying your favorite drink in a water bottle is good.  
IM: There are many drinks to choose from. Any recommendations?  
HW: I like jasmine tea or flavored tea powder.  
IM: I like jasmine tea too. What is flavored tea powder?  
HW: It's a powder with apple and vanilla flavor that you dissolve in water.  
IM: That’s handy. I used to drink a lot of tea and coffee but now stick to water.  
HW: Water is healthy. Do you prefer hard or soft water?  
IM: I find hard water unpleasant.  
HW: Hard water isn’t great for tea and has a different mouthfeel.  
IM: Yes, but my mother prefers hard water, so we have both types at home.  
HW: People who drink hard water often focus on beauty.  
IM: Hard water is also said to be good for cooking.  
HW: I didn’t know that. Water usage is quite detailed.  
IM: Water usage varies depending on the type.  
HW: I usually use water without much thought, but I’ll research it now.  
IM: I’ll look into it too.
