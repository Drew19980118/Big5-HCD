1,"CX: Hello. How is the COVID-19 situation over there?
BU: Hello. Are you asking about the infection situation around our area?
CX: Yes, I'm curious about the number of infections.
BU: I don't watch the news about corona anymore. Even if I watch it, nothing changes.
CX: That might be a good thing. I try to stay aware of it though.
BU: Even if I'm not conscious of it, it's always being reported. I don't mind it anymore.
CX: Yes, that's right. It's important not to let it affect your mental health too much.
BU: That's right. I think it would be okay as long as I don't cause trouble for others when I'm infected.
CX: Certainly. As long as you take preventive measures, there's not much else you can do.
BU: Okay. Let's stop talking about COVID!!
CX: Understood. Is there any positive news you're interested in right now?
BU: I see. Are you referring to the fact that the Chunichi Dragons won yesterday?
CX: You like baseball, don't you? I'm a Giants fan though. Sorry.
BU: No problem at all. I'm just a baseball fan who supports the Chunichi Dragons.
CX: Thank you very much. Ohno's performance was amazing yesterday, wasn't it?
BU: Thank you for knowing. It's a shame about the Giants.
CX: Our pitching staff is not very good, so we tend to lose close games.
BU: Pitcher Hirauchi. Let's do our best. As for the Giants, I'm cheering for Walker and Nakayama.
CX: That's right, if those players perform well, and then Okamoto gets back in form.
BU: Okamoto was removed from the fourth position. Nakata is doing well right now.
CX: Okamoto is in quite bad shape. Yesterday, Nakata hit a home run. Quite a contrast.
BU: He has improved since the game against Chunichi. Nakata was really cool.
CX: I am very humbled, but it's quite impressive to hit a home run off Rydel.
BU: This is the first home run of the year. Amazing. Nakata is great too, but that was just poor battery performance.
CX: I see, the catcher's lead is also a concern for us.
BU: Many commentators are saying that Kinotaku's leadership is not good this year.
CX: I see. A good catcher is really important, isn't it?
BU: Yes, that's right. Even if they can't hit or lead well, I want a catcher who can win.
CX: I want a catcher like Yakult's Nakamura.
BU: Player Nakamura is a good player, isn't he? It feels like his performance dropped a bit after his jersey number changed. Thank you!",1
2,"CX: Are there any long holidays like the Obon holiday?  
BU: No long holidays are coming up. Do you have any plans?  
CX: No, I don't have any plans.  
BU: Are you off today?  
CX: Yes, I'm off because I lost my job due to COVID-19.  
BU: Are you currently job hunting?  
CX: Yes, but I'm taking my time and studying a bit as well.  
BU: Do you have any specific job preferences?  
CX: I'm considering my options carefully.  
BU: What was your previous job?  
CX: I was a TV assistant director.  
BU: In Tokyo?  
CX: Yes, that's correct.  
BU: Was it a well-known company?  
CX: No, it was a production company.  
BU: Who's the most famous person you've met?  
CX: Probably Banana Man.  
BU: Interesting.  
CX: Yes, Banana Man is very kind and funny.  
BU: They seem like great people to work with.  
CX: Yes, Mr. Himura is reserved during breaks.  
BU: Noted.  
CX: Mr. Shitara jokes around even during breaks.  
BU: That must create a lively atmosphere.  
CX: Yes, it's very lively.  
BU: A good atmosphere usually means a good program.  
CX: Yes, it was tough when the staff didn't get along.  
BU: That sounds challenging.  
CX: I always try to prevent that from happening.  
BU: It's best to work enjoyably and harmoniously.",15
3,"CX: Hello. Do you have any plans for today or tomorrow?  
BU: Hello. No plans. Do you have any plans?  
CX: I don't have anything either. I feel like just relaxing.  
BU: Have you eaten rice?  
CX: I'm thinking about having lunch soon.  
BU: Have you decided what to eat?  
CX: Pork shabu-shabu.  
BU: Nice.  
CX: No, I just boil pork and bean sprouts.  
BU: Do you make the broth from scratch?  
CX: No. Just put it in hot water.  
BU: When I heard ""shabu-shabu,"" I thought of the restaurant version.  
CX: I just think of boiling water and adding meat and vegetables.  
BU: That is also good. Do you use ponzu?  
CX: They sell grated daikon radish sauce, and I pour it on.  
BU: Is it mixed with ponzu sauce and grated daikon radish?  
CX: It doesn't have much of a ponzu flavor.  
BU: It's refreshing. Do you like grated daikon radish?  
CX: I like it, but not enough to grate it myself.  
BU: It's easier to buy pre-grated daikon.  
CX: Occasionally, eating grilled fish with grated daikon and soy sauce is exceptional.  
BU: Grated daikon radish and soy sauce are excellent with Atka mackerel.  
CX: Sounds good! Grated daikon and soy sauce taste better with fatty fish.  
BU: Grilled fish is often desired when not frequently consumed at home.  
CX: I only eat at nearby set meal restaurants occasionally.  
BU: The fish at set meal restaurants is good. I'm getting hungry.  
CX: What are you planning to have for lunch?  
BU: I don't usually eat lunch, so it's an extra meal.  
CX: I see. Have a great day.  
BU: Thank you! Goodbye!",4
4,"CX: Hello. Is it hot over there?
CO: Yes.
CX: Are you taking precautions to avoid heatstroke?

CX: Is your friend okay now?

CX: Staying hydrated is crucial.
CO: Yes, the doctor emphasized that.
CX: A typhoon is coming, are you safe?
CO: Yes, how about you?
CX: It's okay here too.
CO: Good. Are you prepared for disasters?
CX: Not fully, but we have water and canned food.
CO: I prepare often due to typhoons.
CX: Smart.
CO: It helps avoid damage.
CX: My home is on the second floor, so I don’t worry much.
CO: Sounds good. Signs caused damage in my area last year.
CX: That’s bad.
CO: Yes, I've been careful since.
CX: Typhoons and heavy rains make me worried.
CO: The typhoon is in the Kanto region now, right?
CX: It seems so. Events are being canceled.

CX: I hope nothing happens.
CO: Understood.",6
5,"CX: Thank you in advance. Do you have something like an Obon holiday?
CO: Yes, I have about a week off for the Obon holiday.
CX: That's nice. Do you have any plans for the holiday?
CO: No specific plans this year.
CX: I see. Is it difficult to make plans because of COVID-19?
CO: Yes, exactly. If it weren't for COVID-19, I would have gone somewhere.
CX: How long do you think the coronavirus situation will continue?
CO: It's hard to say. For now, I'll stay quiet.
CX: I hope things settle down quickly so we can go out and have fun.
CO: Yes. Do you have any plans?
CX: I don't have an Obon holiday itself.
CO: Is it because of work?
CX: No, I'm taking a break from work now, so I've been off all the time.
CO: Then, it's okay!
CX: That's right. Also, since this summer is hot, it might be difficult to go outside.

CX: With the coronavirus situation, I'm wondering if I won't be able to do anything this summer.
CO: How long have you been resting?
CX: It has already been about two and a half years.
CO: That's a long time. What was your previous job?
CX: I was working part-time at a gas station, among other jobs.
CO: I see. Juggling multiple jobs seems busy.
CX: The work itself is easy, but working day and night was really tough.
CO: Certainly. Are you still not looking for a job yet?
CX: Yes. I am currently carefully considering what to do next.
CO: I see. It seems difficult to move around now with the coronavirus situation.
CX: That's really it. There are fewer job openings as well.
CO: That's right. Jobs have disappeared and there are a lot of people flooding job listings.
CX: I wonder what will happen next.
CO: I really think so.",1
6,"CX: Hello! Nice to meet you!  
AT: Nice to meet you too. How can I assist you today?  
CX: Is it hot there today?  
AT: Yes, it's quite humid because a typhoon is approaching.  
CX: I see, it's quite hot and stuffy here too.  
AT: It's been hot lately since it's summer.  
CX: It feels like it has been getting hotter and hotter these past few years.  
AT: I agree, some regions have even exceeded 40 degrees this year.  
CX: That's right. Actually, I went to Tokyo during that period, and it was extremely hot.  
AT: That must have been tough, but it's usually cool indoors.  
CX: To prevent heatstroke, we basically stayed inside the indoor building all the time.  
AT: That's a good strategy. In some regions, not only is the heat intense, but also the water damage is severe.  
CX: Certainly. In the area where I live, it has been raining heavily this past week.  
AT: Was there any damage to your house?  
CX: Fortunately, there was no damage to the house.  
AT: That's good to hear. My parent's hometown in Gojome Town, Akita Prefecture, is being reported a lot in the news today.  
CX: I see. Are they safe at the moment?  
AT: Yes, they are okay. The weather has been unstable, making it a tough summer.  
CX: That's true. The coronavirus is annoying enough as it is.  
AT: It's becoming more prevalent again, and there are frequent news reports about medical strain.  
CX: They said on the news that emergency transport can't keep up due to COVID-19 and heatstroke, and it's scary.  
AT: That's correct. It's hard to imagine people with other illnesses not being able to receive treatment.  
CX: It's painful that there are people who cannot receive medical care and pass away due to non-COVID reasons.  
AT: COVID-19 has generated various types, and it makes one wonder when it will end.  
CX: Last year I thought it was over after getting the vaccine, but it seems like it will continue for a while.  
AT: Yes, there have been multiple updates on the situation.  
CX: This is the fourth time this month, but I'm sure there will be a fifth and sixth time as well.  
AT: This is already the fourth time, right? Have you been okay with side effects in the past?  
CX: The side effects of the third Moderna shot were tough, so I really don't want to get another one.  
AT: That’s understandable. Please make sure to take care of your health.  ",1
7,"CX: Good evening. Is it almost time for dinner?
AT: Yes, it's time to start preparing.
CX: What are you planning to eat?
AT: I haven't decided yet. What about you?
CX: Tonight, I'll have miso soup and canned fish.
AT: Is that everything?
CX: Yes, I'm eating less at dinner lately because my stomach hasn't been feeling well.
AT: Understood. Canned fish is nutritious and convenient.
CX: I'm focusing on getting the necessary nutrition.
AT: Do you include vegetables?
CX: Yes, I add vegetables to the miso soup.
AT: That’s a balanced approach. Do you eat properly in the morning and afternoon?
CX: Yes, I have a solid breakfast and lunch, and keep dinner light.
AT: No problem then. Ensure enough rest in the evening.
CX: However, I've been gaining weight recently, and it troubles me.
AT: Could it be due to lack of exercise?
CX: That too, and maybe my autonomic nerves are affected.
AT: Noted. It's important to consider that.
CX: I often wake up in the middle of the night because it's hard to sleep.
AT: Understood. I wake up about once every three hours.
CX: I wish it were a little cooler or that there was less of a temperature difference.
AT: Do you have an air conditioner at home?
CX: I live in Hokkaido and don't have an air conditioner at home.
AT: Summers can be hot in Hokkaido, and the weather has been intense.
CX: In the past, I was fine without an air conditioner, but recently it's been especially hot.
AT: Consider installing an air conditioner.
CX: I'll seriously think about it next year.
AT: Research various measures this year for heatstroke prevention and better sleep.
CX: Yes, I'd like to have it installed around early spring.
AT: Reservations get crowded in summer, so that plan is good.",2
8,"CX: Thank you in advance. Do you have any plans for tomorrow?

AT: No plans for tomorrow. How about you?

CX: I don't have any plans either. I plan to spend the day leisurely.

AT: I also relax on Sundays since I work on Monday.

CX: What kind of work do you do?

AT: I am a system engineer, mainly desk work.

CX: Is it hard on your shoulders and eyes?

AT: My shoulders and lower back get stiff, so I move them occasionally.

CX: I used to do desk work too. It really takes a toll on your body.

AT: Yes, it can be uncomfortable.

CX: It seems you shouldn't massage yourself too much, but I still do.

AT: I use massage machines and visit a chiropractor.

CX: I used the one with adzuki beans for warming.

AT: What kind of thing is it?

CX: It's something you heat up in the microwave and place on your eyes or shoulders.

AT: It improves blood circulation.

CX: Yes, and it can be used repeatedly!

AT: Does your body get stiff when you read books?

CX: Yes, I do get stiff. I do some stretching to loosen up.

AT: Stretching is necessary but hard to do at the office.

CX: Would it be okay to do stretches like turning your neck or pulling your arms back?

AT: Yes, that should be fine.

CX: Can you work from home sometimes?

AT: It's half at the office and half working remotely.

CX: Is working from home the only good thing about the COVID-19 pandemic?

AT: Yes, it reduces commute time.

CX: Crowded trains are tough too, right?

AT: Correct. I’ll make better use of working from home.

CX: I hope telecommuting becomes more widespread.

AT: Okay.",5
