BS: That program starts around 10 PM, correct?
BJ: That's right. Haven't you seen it?
BS: I have seen it. It focuses on verifying various theories, correct?

BJ: I like pranks and comedians. Do you have a favorite comedian?
BS: Yes, Sandwichman and Jiro from Sissonne are my favorites. Just watching them makes me laugh.

BS: Are there any libraries or bookstores nearby?
BJ: Neither of them are at the nearest station. What kind of books do you like?

BJ: I know! I often watch recipe videos.
BS: The video is interesting, isn't it? This is that person's recipe book.
BJ: That person who cooks while being completely drunk, right?

BS: It's quick to make, so it's helpful during dinner time.
BJ: Is that book also available at the library?
BS: Yes, they have them. There are also quite a few recipe books, which is very helpful.

BJ: More than anything, it's free, isn't it? It would be nice if there was a movie version of the library too.
BS: The library I go to also allows you to watch DVDs.
BJ: Such an amazing place! I'll go check it out next time. Thank you for the wonderful suggestion.
BS: Please enjoy yourself.",1,15,15,15,15
