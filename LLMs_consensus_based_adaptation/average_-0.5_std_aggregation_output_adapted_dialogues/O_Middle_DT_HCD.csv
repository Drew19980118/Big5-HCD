1,"DT: Hello. Nice to meet you.  
CP: ""Likewise, thank you in advance!""  
DT: What were you doing this morning?  
CP: ""I haven't really done anything special. Just hung out the laundry.""  
DT: It's very hot. Do you feel like going out?  
CP: ""That's right. And it's raining here too.""  
DT: Makes it difficult to go out.  
CP: Yes, it's humid. How is it where you are?  
DT: It's sunny here.  
CP: Oh, really? I see. Where are you located?  
DT: I'm in the Kanto region. How about you?  
CP: ""Is it after the typhoon has passed? I'm in Kyushu.""  
DT: Oh, Kyushu! Will it rain all day?  
CP: Yes, it will. The rain is intermittent but strong when it does rain.  
DT: I hope it doesn't rain for days.  
CP: Yes, indeed. Flooding is a concern in this area.  
DT: Do you live near a river?  
CP: Yes, there is a large river nearby.  
DT: That is concerning.  
CP: The levees have broken many times in the past.  
DT: It's worrying. There have been many flood disasters recently.  
CP: The weather is unusual, with too much heavy rain.  
DT: That's true. It feels like a tropical climate.  
CP: Really! I wish the rain would be more consistent.  
DT: It's hard to tell if the rainy season is over.  
CP: This year, it didn't rain much during the rainy season.  
DT: So, it's raining now because of that.  
CP: Ah, maybe!  
DT: Either way, it seems it will rain.  
CP: ""That's probably true. It's also a problem if it doesn't rain, so there are pros and cons.""",2,15,15,15,15
2,"DT: Nice to meet you.
CP: Nice to meet you too! Ready to assist you.
DT: What have you been doing recently?
CP: I've been focusing on writing novels.
DT: Wow! You write instead of just reading?
CP: Yes, it's a hobby of mine. I enjoy it even though I'm not particularly skilled.
DT: I'm not great at writing, so I respect that.
CP: Thank you! Many people are into writing these days, and it's fun to connect with them.
DT: Do you publish your work somewhere?
CP: Yes, online. I also participate in short story contests.
DT: That's great. You can write from anywhere with a computer.
CP: Exactly. I usually write pieces that are about 5 to 10 pages long.
DT: That sounds manageable.
CP: Some people write up to 500 pages. It's impressive.
DT: Really? That's incredible. Have you always liked writing?
CP: Not really. A friend introduced me to it, and I found it enjoyable.
DT: So that was the trigger?
CP: Yes. My friend writes around 300 pages for major contests.
DT: That sounds like it could catch a publisher's eye.
CP: Writing 300 pages is beyond me. Authors are amazing.
DT: They really are. How were you as a child?
CP: My friend and I were just regular kids, not big readers.
DT: It's surprising you can write well without reading much.
CP: It is! But I've always liked picture books.
DT: Picture books are lovely and comforting.
CP: Yes, their illustrations are very cute and soothing.
DT: I used to like Guri and Gura.
CP: I love that! I always wanted to try their pancakes.
DT: Those pancakes are iconic.
CP: I definitely want to try them someday!",1,15,15,15,15
3,"DT: Hello!  
CP: Hello!  
DT: Every day, it's a hassle to think about dinner. What do you plan to eat today?  
CP: Today's dish is scheduled to be Mapo eggplant.  
DT: Sounds good! Maybe I'll try that.  
CP: Eggplants are in season right now and taste great.  
DT: I don't buy eggplants often. Are they in season now?  
CP: My father has a vegetable garden, and I got these from there.  
DT: That's nice. Fresh vegetables are always great.  
CP: Indeed. My parents live nearby, so I'm grateful for that. Are your parents close by?  
DT: I'm jealous! My parents live far away. I haven't been back in years.  
CP: That's unfortunate. Traveling far is difficult, especially with COVID-19.  
DT: Yes, many people can't go home because of COVID-19.  
CP: How do you travel back, by Shinkansen or airplane?  
DT: By Shinkansen. I'm worried about ventilation.  
CP: Enclosed spaces can be concerning.  
DT: Yes, it's uncomfortable when elevators are crowded.  
CP: Absolutely, it's best to avoid them when possible.  
DT: I hope the pandemic ends soon.  
CP: I agree. Do you use video calls to keep in touch with family?  
DT: Yes, they enjoy seeing their grandchild.  
CP: That must make them very happy.  
DT: Yes, they think it's better not to visit to avoid COVID-19.  
CP: That's a wise decision. Your family must hope the pandemic ends soon.  
DT: Yes, I was planning to visit this summer. I dislike COVID-19.  
CP: Understandable. They must miss you a lot.  
DT: Yes, we met in May, and they've grown since then.  
CP: I hope the situation improves soon.  
DT: Me too. Let's stay healthy.  
CP: Agreed. Let's be cautious!",1,15,15,15,15
4,"DT: Hello.
EM: Hello! How can I help you today?
DT: What is your hobby?
EM: I enjoy working on bikes and cars. Do you have any interest in vehicles?
DT: I don’t have much experience with that. Do you focus more on the interior or exterior of the car?
EM: I like restoring old cars. Bringing them back to life is fulfilling.
DT: That sounds interesting. How old is your car?
EM: It's a 1962 Mini Cooper. Are you familiar with it?
DT: Yes, many people drive Coopers. They have a unique charm.
EM: Indeed. The BMW version is popular, but mine is an older Rover model, which has its own nostalgic appeal.
DT: It has a retro and cute image.
EM: Exactly. I make sure to fix any issues quickly to keep it running smoothly.
DT: I like old Fiat cars, especially the Fiat Cinquecento.
EM: The Fiat Cinque is a great car. Do you find it easy to work on old cars, or are you just interested?
DT: I’d love to try working on one. Some cars are easier to tweak than others, depending on their design.
EM: That's true. Working on cars can be tough for amateurs due to needing specialized tools and sometimes heavy equipment. Have you considered any specific models?
DT: Do you drive your Mini Cooper often?
EM: Yes, it's our only car, so we use it frequently.
DT: Do you go on long trips?
EM: Not very often. Mainly within Tokyo or occasionally to Nagano. Do you enjoy long drives?
DT: How is the fuel economy?
EM: It's not great, around 7 kilometers per liter, and it needs high-octane fuel.
DT: As expected. But it must feel different when you're driving it, right? Must be quite an experience.
EM: Yes, it's very special to me and makes every drive feel unique.
DT: Where can you get such old cars?
EM: I got mine at an auction, but you can also find them in used car listings if you search thoroughly.
DT: You got it at an auction? That must have been expensive!
EM: It was 400,000 yen, which was reasonable considering its condition.
DT: That's surprising! I thought it would be much more.
EM: It did need repairs, so it was almost like buying scrap iron. Do you enjoy attending car auctions?",10,15,15,15,15
5,"DT: Please!

EM: Please!

DT: What did you eat for lunch today?

EM: Kama-tama udon.

DT: I often eat Kama-tama udon for lunch. Do you prefer cold or hot udon?

EM: Warm udon is comforting, but cold udon has its charm.

DT: I usually go to Marugame or Hanamaru Udon. Do you like different places?

EM: Yes, I look for places with better quality.

DT: Are there many good udon places?

EM: Fukushima, Chichibu, and Kagawa are known for delicious udon.

DT: Kagawa seems special. Is it?

EM: Yes, the udon in Kagawa is delicious and affordable.

DT: It's considered the soul food of Kagawa, right?

EM: Yes, and some shops operate in greenhouses.

DT: A greenhouse shop sounds unique. Do you have any recommendations?

EM: I don’t remember the names, but those spots are worth visiting.

DT: I'll plan to visit Kagawa then. Is it very different from what I've tried here?

EM: Yes, it's unique and authentic.

DT: Do they mix in eggs in the original version?

EM: Yes, eggs are common, and sometimes croquettes too.

DT: Talking about this is making me hungry.

EM: Food discussions can do that.

DT: I could eat udon anytime. Maybe I'll look up some recipes online.

EM: Good idea! Udon is versatile, so try different variations.

DT: Not Kama-tama at night, though. What do you think?

EM: I make Kama-tama udon at home, but yaki udon is great too.

DT: Does the warmth depend on the soup base?

EM: Yes, the soup is important. Most are ready-made. How about making yaki udon?

DT: That sounds great. I’ll try it.

EM: Enjoy cooking and your meal!",24,15,15,15,15

EN: Have you seen the latest One Piece movie?

DT: No, have you?

EN: Seeing it tomorrow.

DT: I don't watch much anime. Do you read manga and watch anime?

EN: Yes, but I prefer Hunter x Hunter.

DT: Noted. I’m excited about the movie.

EN: Avoiding spoilers.

DT: Are spoilers from the movie in the manga or online?

EN: People talk about it a lot.

DT: That’s surprising.

EN: Official spoilers are common. Feels inevitable.

DT: I wish they wouldn’t do that.

EN: Popularity makes it hard to avoid.
