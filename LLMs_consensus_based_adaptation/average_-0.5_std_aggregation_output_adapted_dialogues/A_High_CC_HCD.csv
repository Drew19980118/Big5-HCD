BL: Nice to meet you.  
CC: Did you do anything summery?  
BL: Playing with water in the bath.  
CC: That's nice. Do you have children?  
BL: Yes, I put her in a swimsuit.  
CC: We probably can't go to the sea or the pool, right?  
BL: We can go this year, but the pool still seems scary.  
CC: Oh, really? Is it because of the pool itself or the coronavirus?  
BL: Due to COVID-19, I haven't been to a pool.  
CC: Understandable, it can be intimidating.  
BL: You need to get used to it when you're young. I can't swim either.  
CC: I wasn't good at it either. But walking along the beach made me want to swim.  
BL: It's impressive to swim in the sea.  
CC: But I'm not sure I can swim now...  
BL: If you could swim before, you should be fine now.  
CC: I don't think I'll drown. I haven't swum since becoming an adult.  
BL: Even at the beach, you'd probably just play on the shore.  
CC: That's right. I haven't ridden a bicycle for about 10 years.  
BL: 10 years is a long time. I could ride normally after a few years.  
CC: I think I can ride, but riding on the road makes me nervous.  
BL: It's scary with many cars.  
CC: I feel nervous seeing bikes on the road and on the sidewalk.  
BL: Sidewalks with separate lanes for bicycles and pedestrians are safer.  
CC: Yes, that's better.  
BL: More separated sidewalks would be reassuring.  
CC: At Kawasaki Station, I saw many sections for bicycles.  
BL: Some places are more advanced.  
CC: I think so.  
BL: I hope more places improve.",2,15,15,15,15
3,"CC: Nice to meet you.
BL: Nice to meet you.
CC: What do you usually do when you have free time?
BL: When I have a little free time, I check social media.
CC: Is it something like Instagram?
BL: Mainly on Twitter.
CC: Twitter? I also look at it occasionally.
BL: Even though I want to see my acquaintances' tweets, I often end up seeing recommended ones.
CC: Don't you think Twitter's recommendation feature is too frequent?
BL: There are many recommendations. Related things might be coming up, but they are all from people I don't know at all.
CC: I see a lot of tweets from people I'm not following, lol.
BL: That’s correct. Usually complaints come in.
CC: I only check Twitter occasionally, so when I do, there are a lot of updates piled up.
BL: Many people update frequently, don't they?
CC: That's right. But I spend more time looking at Instagram. Don't you look at Instagram?
BL: I rarely check Instagram, to the point where I have to log in again when I do.
CC: I finally installed TikTok the other day.
BL: Oh! There’s a lot of dancing.
CC: I was too young to understand the vibe! Lol.
BL: That’s often the case. It probably doesn’t suit me either.
CC: I like dancing, so I thought it might be good, but it was just okay.
BL: Have you ever done dancing?
CC: Ah, just a little bit when I was a student!
BL: Dance changes with the times, doesn’t it? I’m not sure if modern dance can even be called dance. Haha.
CC: I thought Chocopla, who is also active on TikTok, is a genius.
BL: Is he a famous person?
CC: Do you know the comedians called Chocolate Planet? The topic has shifted from dancing though.
BL: Ah, they’re entertainers! It sounds interesting to see things other than dance.
CC: In a TikTok filled with incomprehensible posts, I was impressed because this one was exceptionally nonsensical. Chocopla.
BL: It seems interesting to go all out!
CC: It was fun talking with you! Thank you very much.
BL: I also had fun. Thank you as well.",1,16,16,16,16
