BL: Nice to meet you.  
CC: Did you do anything summery?  
BL: Playing with water in the bath.  
CC: That's nice. Do you have children?  
BL: Yes, I put her in a swimsuit.  
CC: We probably can't go to the sea or the pool, right?  
BL: We can go this year, but the pool still seems scary.  
CC: Oh, really? Is it because of the pool itself or the coronavirus?  
BL: Due to COVID-19, I haven't been to a pool.  
CC: Understandable, it can be intimidating.  
BL: You need to get used to it when you're young. I can't swim either.  
CC: I wasn't good at it either. But walking along the beach made me want to swim.  
BL: It's impressive to swim in the sea.  
CC: But I'm not sure I can swim now...  
BL: If you could swim before, you should be fine now.  
CC: I don't think I'll drown. I haven't swum since becoming an adult.  
BL: Even at the beach, you'd probably just play on the shore.  
CC: That's right. I haven't ridden a bicycle for about 10 years.  
BL: 10 years is a long time. I could ride normally after a few years.  
CC: I think I can ride, but riding on the road makes me nervous.  
BL: It's scary with many cars.  
CC: I feel nervous seeing bikes on the road and on the sidewalk.  
BL: Sidewalks with separate lanes for bicycles and pedestrians are safer.  
CC: Yes, that's better.  
BL: More separated sidewalks would be reassuring.  
CC: At Kawasaki Station, I saw many sections for bicycles.  
BL: Some places are more advanced.  
CC: I think so.  
BL: I hope more places improve.",2,15,15,15,15
3,"CC: Nice to meet you.
BL: Nice to meet you.
CC: What do you usually do when you have free time?
BL: When I have a little free time, I check social media.
CC: Is it something like Instagram?
BL: Mainly on Twitter.
CC: Twitter? I also look at it occasionally.
BL: Even though I want to see my acquaintances' tweets, I often end up seeing recommended ones.
CC: Don't you think Twitter's recommendation feature is too frequent?
BL: There are many recommendations. Related things might be coming up, but they are all from people I don't know at all.
CC: I see a lot of tweets from people I'm not following, lol.
BL: That’s correct. Usually complaints come in.
CC: I only check Twitter occasionally, so when I do, there are a lot of updates piled up.
BL: Many people update frequently, don't they?
CC: That's right. But I spend more time looking at Instagram. Don't you look at Instagram?
BL: I rarely check Instagram, to the point where I have to log in again when I do.
CC: I finally installed TikTok the other day.
BL: Oh! There’s a lot of dancing.
CC: I was too young to understand the vibe! Lol.
BL: That’s often the case. It probably doesn’t suit me either.
CC: I like dancing, so I thought it might be good, but it was just okay.
BL: Have you ever done dancing?
CC: Ah, just a little bit when I was a student!
BL: Dance changes with the times, doesn’t it? I’m not sure if modern dance can even be called dance. Haha.
CC: I thought Chocopla, who is also active on TikTok, is a genius.
BL: Is he a famous person?
CC: Do you know the comedians called Chocolate Planet? The topic has shifted from dancing though.
BL: Ah, they’re entertainers! It sounds interesting to see things other than dance.
CC: In a TikTok filled with incomprehensible posts, I was impressed because this one was exceptionally nonsensical. Chocopla.
BL: It seems interesting to go all out!
CC: It was fun talking with you! Thank you very much.
BL: I also had fun. Thank you as well.",1,16,16,16,16
4,"CC: Hello!  
BR: Greetings. How can I assist you today?  
CC: Do you exercise?  
BR: Recently, I've only been walking and doing sit-ups. Is there a particular exercise you're interested in?  
CC: Do you go for walks often?  
BR: Before the weather got too hot, I used to walk for over an hour daily. Walking can be very beneficial.  
CC: Results start to show after about 20 minutes, right?  
BR: Yes, that's correct. Consistency is key to seeing results.  
CC: Interesting.  
BR: Do you exercise? Maybe I can suggest some activities that fit your routine.  
CC: No, but a walk along the river near my house sounds pleasant. The scenery there is inspiring.  
BR: That does sound nice. Is the river close to your home?  
CC: Yes, but the heat and strong wind make it tough lately.  
BR: I understand. Is the river wide and exposed to the wind?  
CC: It's quite spacious, and the sea is relatively close.  
BR: That must contribute to the windiness. My area is more mountainous, so it’s different.  
CC: Is the current fast?  
BR: No, the river here is calm, which makes it relaxing to watch.  
CC: Watching water flow is always calming.  
BR: I agree. It's very soothing to observe from a bridge.  
CC: The strong sun can be uncomfortable.  
BR: That's tough without shade. It's important to protect your eyes on sunny days.  
CC: The wind on the bridge is strong, too.  
BR: That sounds intense. Fortunately, it's not as windy here.  
CC: On windy days, the bridge sways.  
BR: That sounds unsettling. It’s interesting how different it can be upstream and downstream.  
CC: I'd like to explore the river from the start to the sea. The adventure sounds exciting.  
BR: River rafting could be a great way to do that.  
CC: I saw an ad for river experiences. I'm curious.  
BR: That sounds like a wonderful adventure. Would you like more information on that?",23,15,15,15,15

CH: Usually at 8:30 AM.  
CC: You had good stamina.  
CH: Yes, being young helped, but things change.  
CC: Do walks help you sleep better now?  
CH: I used to experience sleep paralysis.  
CC: What causes sleep paralysis?  
CH: Often stress and overwork.  
CC: Managing that must have been tough.

CC: It's often clear in hindsight.  
CH: Exactly, I aim for better sleep now.  
CC: Definitely! Take care.

6,"CC: Good evening!  
CH: Good evening. How can I assist you?  
CC: Are you feeling sleepy at this time?  
CH: It varies, but usually, yes.  
CC: Do you usually go to bed around midnight?  
CH: Often around midnight. How about you?  
CC: A bit later, around 1 or 2 AM.  
CH: Isn't it hard to wake up if you sleep late?  
CC: I'm not working right now, so it's okay. When I am working, I aim for 1 AM.  
CH: Sleep needs vary among individuals, right?  
CC: Yes, it can be influenced by genetics.  
CH: Some are naturally night owls.  
CC: Exactly. Matsuko Deluxe is a night owl.  
CH: That’s expected.  
CC: If you were a morning person, it would be surprising.  
CH: Different people need different sleep durations.  
CC: Seven hours works for me. How about you?  
CH: I need about 8 hours, though it's not always possible.  
CC: Sleeping 10 hours seems excessive, right?  
CH: For adults, it's not usually needed.  
CC: If I sleep 10 hours, I struggle to wake up.  
CH: I used to sleep a lot in the countryside as a child.  
CC: More sleep in the countryside?  
CH: Generally, yes, but it varies.  
CC: I didn’t expect that.  
CH: There's not much to do after dark.  
CC: Don't you visit friends' houses?

7,"CC: Hello, nice to meet you!
BV: Nice to meet you too. How can I assist you today?
CC: What do you do on your days off from work?
BV: Recently, I've been primarily focused on tidying up the house.
CC: I see. Did you get it all sorted out?
BV: That's quite challenging. It gets messy quickly.
CC: Even though I tidy up, it gets messy again. I understand.
BV: When I have work, tidying up becomes a lower priority.
CC: That's true. In my case, even if I clean up over the weekend, it gets messy again by the next weekend.
BV: I understand. Improving tidying skills is a goal for many.
CC: Do you have a fixed day off?
BV: I usually have Sundays off.
CC: The others are basically work days?
BV: That's correct.
CC: It's tough. But if you could have a break even just on Sundays, you might be able to meet your friends.
BV: Yes, I spent time with friends last Sunday.
CC: In the past, when I had a job that required working on weekends and holidays, I couldn't meet anyone.
BV: Coordinating breaks in such jobs is indeed difficult.
CC: That's right.
BV: Are you in the service industry or something similar?
CC: At that time, yes. It was customer-oriented work, so weekends and holidays were crucial.
BV: I understand.
CC: Having weekdays off is convenient because you can go to the bank or other stores when they are not crowded.
BV: Weekday breaks do offer such advantages.
CC: I would be happy with one day off during the weekdays and one day off on either Saturday or Sunday.
BV: That arrangement would balance work and personal time.
CC: I don't have many friends, but if I'm put in a situation where I can't see anyone at all, it gets quite exhausting.
BV: Taking a break to recharge is important.
CC: Taking a break is indeed important!
BV: Let's take it easy. Have a good day.",1,15,15,15,15
