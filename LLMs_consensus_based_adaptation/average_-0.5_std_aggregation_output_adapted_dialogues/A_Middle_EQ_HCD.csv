BO: Yes, that's part of it. Also, my movements have become sluggish.  
EQ: Do you know the cause?  
BO: It might be a lack of exercise.

BO: There are many gyms around, but I've never seen a women-only one.  
EQ: It might not feel like a traditional gym. There are many elderly people, and it's just the right amount of exercise for me.  
BO: I agree. A hardcore gym might be too much for me as well.  
EQ: I used to overdo it and get tired, so this is just right.  
BO: Doing it at your own pace is best.  
EQ: It's convenient since it's only an hour from leaving home to coming back.  
BO: That sounds good. I might try it.  
EQ: Please search for it. Exercising will improve both your physical and mental condition.  
BO: Yes. Thank you for the information.",2,15,15,15,15
