1,"CF: Good evening!  
BW: Good evening. How are you despite the hot weather?  
CF: Thanks for asking! Other than my cavities, I'm okay.  
BW: I have a cavity too. I should go to the dentist soon.  
CF: I don't like dentists either, but the pain in June forced me to go.  
BW: I only go when necessary.  
CF: Regular check-ups after treatment are bothersome.  
BW: Yes, treatments and check-ups can take a long time.  
CF: I have several cavities, so I'll be visiting for a while.  
BW: I went two years ago and stopped after the main issue was fixed.  
CF: I did the same three years ago.  
BW: Issues can return quickly. Finding a good dentist is key.  
CF: It's hard to know which dentist is good.  
BW: Reviews can help, but personal experience varies.  
CF: Reviews don't always match the experience.  
BW: Popular dentists might not suit everyone.  
CF: My last dentist was like that.  
BW: It's difficult. Treatment can cause more issues like food getting stuck.  
CF: That's troubling. Makes me want to complain.  
BW: My friend struggled with sensitivity after gap correction.  
CF: Braces can cause sensitivity and are expensive.  
BW: Yes, and complaints aren't always well-received.  
CF: Dentists are expensive, so it's disappointing when issues arise.  
BW: Problems should be resolved properly.  
CF: It's hard to address issues directly at the moment.  
BW: My friend communicated issues later, but it was hard.  
CF: I see. Were they resolved?  
BW: Not without an additional fee.  
CF: An additional fee is concerning. Thanks for the info.  
BW: You're welcome.",4
2,"CF: Good evening!
BW: Good evening. Do you exercise regularly?
CF: No, I don't exercise at all.
BW: I've been too busy to keep up with it myself.
CF: I tried water walking at the municipal pool once and planned to go weekly.
BW: Did you find it effective?
CF: Yes, it’s a good workout. I move back and forth in the pool and sometimes do the flutter kick.
BW: Can you still swim normally?
CF: I used to swim but probably not anymore.
BW: It would be nice to swim if it’s not crowded.
CF: The pool is less crowded in the evening, around 9 PM.
BW: Some pools have separate areas for swimming and walking.
CF: That’s helpful.
BW: It’s hard to maintain a routine.
CF: It takes determination.
BW: It’s difficult without a clear goal. I stretch at home sometimes.
CF: I do stretches after using the computer for a long time.
BW: Long computer use can make your body stiff.
CF: Blood flow gets worse.
BW: My shoulders and lower back are sore. I need to find time to exercise.
CF: It’s hard to find time when busy with work and other things.
BW: It often gets postponed with ""I’ll do it tomorrow.""
CF: I understand that very well.
BW: Using an app might help manage it better.
CF: Smartwatches and smartphones are useful for that.
BW: They are convenient.
CF: I manage my sleep time with my smartphone and check it daily.
BW: You can monitor sleep and heart rate.
CF: It’s very convenient. Thank you for the talk.
BW: Thank you as well.",11
3,"CF: Good evening! Nice to meet you.  
BW: Nice to meet you. What have you been interested in lately?  
CF: Casual cycling.  
BW: What is pottering?  
CF: Aimlessly wandering on a bicycle.  
BW: City or nature?  
CF: City. Check Shibuya pottering on YouTube.  
BW: I will. Anything else you're into?  
CF: Practicing the ukulele.  
BW: Are you good at it?  
CF: Used to play, now practicing again.  
BW: What songs?  
CF: Hawaiian and Western songs.  
BW: Do you listen to music?  
CF: Yes, Japanese music and game soundtracks.  
BW: Which game soundtracks?  
CF: Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger.  
BW: Final Fantasy music is famous.  
CF: Yes, I enjoy it.  
BW: Koichi Sugiyama from Dragon Quest passed away recently.  
CF: He was amazing. Hope the good music continues.  
BW: Japan can be proud of games and game music.  
CF: I agree. Thank you!  
BW: Thank you.",7
4,"CF: Good morning. It's sunny and refreshing this morning.  
BQ: Good morning. It is raining here.  
CF: Is it a typhoon?  
BQ: That might also have an impact.  
CF: I see. It rained heavily here yesterday, so please be careful there as well.  
BQ: Thank you. Recently, there has been a lot of heavy rain in various places, hasn't there?  
CF: That's right. Flooding in familiar areas is concerning.  
BQ: Have you ever experienced flood damage?  
CF: There was a time when a bridge over the nearby river collapsed, but that's about it. Have you ever experienced anything like that?  
BQ: My town is fine, but the neighboring town is particularly vulnerable to flooding.  
CF: I see. Cleaning up after a flood is really challenging, isn't it?  
BQ: Yes, I heard the smell is also strong.  
CF: Especially in the summer, things spoil quickly.  
BQ: Do you think insurance covers flood damage?  
CF: I hope it does, but it's hard to be certain.  
BQ: I heard that in the case of a fire, insurance won't be paid out unless it's a total loss.  
CF: Is that so! That is troubling.  
BQ: Are you doing anything for disaster prevention?  
CF: Well, I might not have done much. Just about preparing some stockpiles.  
BQ: I haven't done anything in particular either. We should prepare for stockpiling, right?  
CF: It would be good to have some supplies ready. There are cookies that can be stored for five years.  
BQ: There are ones that can be rehydrated with water. They seem to be quite delicious.  
CF: I heard that recent ones are very well-made and tasty, so I would like to try them once.  
BQ: It's important to get used to the taste.  
CF: That's true. Floods are scary, but earthquakes might be the scariest.  
BQ: They say another big earthquake is coming, so measures are necessary.  
CF: Every year, I live thinking ""This year will come!"" but my stockpile is still not quite enough.  
BQ: There are also feelings of not wanting to think about disasters.  
CF: I tend to look away from reality. Thank you for the talk!  
BQ: Thank you.",2
5,"CF: Good morning.
BQ: Good morning. It's Obon. Any plans?
CF: We should visit the grave, but due to COVID-19, we won't this year.
BQ: Understood. I visited yesterday as I live nearby.
CF: It gets very hot there, right?
BQ: Yes, it was. I got sweaty.
CF: Your ancestors must be pleased. Any other plans during Obon?
BQ: I plan to visit a nearby hot spring.
CF: Do you visit often?
BQ: Once a year overnight, frequent day trips.
CF: That sounds nice.
BQ: Do you like hot springs?
CF: Yes, I used to go to super sento often.
BQ: Super sento is comfortable for a whole day.
CF: Agreed. Some places resemble manga cafes now.
BQ: I liked napping in theater-like rooms.
CF: It's nice. I slept well too.
BQ: Rice dishes like ramen are also good.
CF: Yes, and snacks and beer are enjoyable too.
BQ: They are the best after a bath. I saw someone drunk.
CF: That could be me!
BQ: Some places offer overnight stays.
CF: I've never stayed overnight, but it's convenient if you miss the last train.
BQ: Good to know. That is helpful.
CF: If I miss the last train, I'd prefer a super sento.
BQ: Manga cafes are cramped and only have showers.
CF: Correct. It's best to go home if possible.
BQ: Do you usually commute by train?
CF: No, I work from home, so no commute.
BQ: Working from home sounds nice. Thank you.
CF: See you later.",3
6,"CF: Good morning. Are you an early riser?
BQ: Good morning. I wake up at 7:30.
CF: I wake up at 5 a.m. on weekdays.
BQ: Do you go for a walk?
CF: No, I prepare things for my family.
BQ: Do you get any rest?
CF: I wake up early to make bento.
BQ: Using frozen foods might help.
CF: Do you use frozen food? What do you like in your lunchbox?
BQ: Grilled salted salmon.
CF: That sounds good.
BQ: Any favorite bento side dishes?
CF: Kinpira and shibazuke.
BQ: I like sweet kinpira.
CF: White sesame seeds make it better.
BQ: How long have you been making bento?
CF: 13 years.
BQ: Noted.
CF: Thank you. I still struggle with tamagoyaki.
BQ: Sweet or savory?
CF: I like it salty, but I make it sweet.
BQ: How do you make it look store-bought?
CF: Wrapping it well is difficult.
BQ: Any bento side dish you're confident in?
CF: Hamburger steak and kinpira.
BQ: Are they more difficult than tamagoyaki?
CF: I prepare them the day before.
BQ: Prepared meals are convenient.
CF: I prefer to sleep more. Thanks for the chat!
BQ: Thank you.",6
7,"CF: Good morning. I thought I would buy something I want since payday is next week.
BQ: Good morning. What do you want to buy?
CF: A display that can be connected to a computer.
BQ: Displays come in various types.
CF: I want to connect it to a laptop and have two screens.
BQ: A multi-display setup will make work more efficient.
CF: I want to watch videos while working.
BQ: Understood. Finding a good display can be challenging with many options.
CF: Yes, it's difficult to choose with so many options available.
BQ: I am also considering getting a monitor arm.
CF: Noted.
BQ: I want to move it around a lot. However, Japanese-made ones are expensive.
CF: Yes, they are quite pricey. Worth considering though.
BQ: High cost often means good performance, which helps in reducing eye strain.
CF: I see.
BQ: It's important to take care of your eyes when using a computer for extended periods.
CF: Understood. I got blue light blocking glasses.
BQ: How effective are they?
CF: They are like lightly tinted sunglasses.
BQ: Does the brightness feel different when you're not wearing them?
CF: Yes, you can really tell the difference.
BQ: Understood. I will consider getting a pair too.
CF: Certainly. One drawback: the glasses reflect blue light depending on the angle.
BQ: Noted. That could look cool.
CF: Elementary school students say ""Wow!"" when they see them.
BQ: Like the Terminator.
CF: It looks that way.
BQ: Thank you for the information.",5
8,"CF: Good morning. It's a bit cool this morning, isn't it?  
BZ: Good morning. It's incredibly humid!  
CF: It might be because the weather is going to get worse.  
BZ: That's right. I'll go visit the grave while the weather holds.  
CF: It's Obon, isn't it?  
BZ: That's right. The sense of seasons is disappearing.  
CF: Isn't it surprisingly hot in a cemetery because there are no shaded areas?  
BZ: Sure. You should go as soon as possible!  
CF: It seems like it would be good to go in the morning. Here, there's a typhoon so I'm staying at home.  
BZ: Did the Kanto region take a direct hit today?  
CF: Given that, it’s sunny now, so I’m wondering what will happen.  
BZ: If we prepare, the typhoon won't come, right?  
CF: It's strange, isn't it! This time we're quite well-prepared though.  
BZ: That's right. The typhoon is changing direction towards places that are not prepared.  
CF: Well, they might not come here. It's a good thing, but it's a bit frustrating.  
BZ: And then, if you're off guard, it'll come!  
CF: When you've eaten up all your stockpiled food, right? I understand!  
BZ: In any case, I pray that it doesn't get worse!  
CF: Thank you. Actually, I wanted to go out to eat, so I'll consider it while keeping an eye on the situation.  
BZ: However, it is humid. The room temperature is already 31 degrees.  
CF: It's high! This one looks a bit lower but feels more humid.  
BZ: There is a nice breeze blowing outside. I think I'll cut some bellflowers from the garden and take them to the grave.  
CF: Having bellflowers in the garden is nice.  
BZ: I liked it so much that I divided and replanted it many times, and now my garden is full of bellflowers.  
CF: That's nice! I'm envious because it's something that's hard to do on a condominium balcony.  
BZ: We also live on the second and third floors. There's a small garden, or rather, a flower bed on the first floor.  
CF: Oh! I was just regretting the fact that I let my cherry tomato plant wither the other day.  
BZ: That was unfortunate. Did you not eat any at all?  
CF: Actually, I was quite satisfied with how much I managed to achieve! I'll do my best next time. Thank you for the conversation!  
BZ: Thank you very much, too!",1
