1,"DL: Good evening, please assist me.
DK: Thank you. How can I help you?
DL: Do you have any favorite foods, like minkabu?
DK: I enjoy katsudon and had it today.
DL: I love katsudon too! I had it this morning.
DK: Do you often eat such meals in the morning?
DL: Yes, I tend to eat a lot in the morning and lightly at night.
DK: That makes sense. Has this been your routine for a long time?
DL: Yes, it started when I was on a diet.
DK: Eating before bed can lead to weight gain.
DL: But don't you find late-night snacks tempting?
DK: Yes, I do. I used to have instant yakisoba and alcohol as a late-night snack.
DL: That combination sounds great. Now I want to eat, even though I plan to eat lightly at night.
DK: Recently, I've been avoiding drinking at night.
DL: Are you trying to have alcohol-free days?
DK: I don't drink every day and recently prefer non-alcoholic drinks. I drink only during dinner.
DL: I haven't had non-alcoholic drinks lately. How do they taste?
DK: Domestic non-alcoholic beers have a strong aroma, but low-alcohol Beery is delicious.
DL: The real thing is always the best. Do you agree?
DK: Yes, I enjoy non-alcoholic beer made in Germany, available at Gyomu Super.
DL: I often go to Gyomu Super. They have a wide variety of alcohol.
DK: Yes, I usually buy alcohol and sweets there.
DL: Do you have any recommendations?
DK: The spicy Mala Ikari Beans sold there are good.
DL: Thanks. I'll look for them next time. I often buy squid fries.
DK: Fried squid is nice.
DL: The saltiness pairs well with beer.
DK: That sounds good. Now I want a drink.
DL: I feel like drinking too, even though it's late. I'm curious about those beans.
DK: Considering the time, let's be patient!",1,15,15,15,15
2,"DL: Please take care of it.
DE: Understood.
DL: Do you have any favorite foods?
DE: Recently, I’ve been enjoying takoyaki from the supermarket deli.
DL: Is it because the octopus pieces are large?
DE: More because of the dashi flavor and chewy dough.
DL: Sounds tasty.
DE: It’s unique.
DL: Are there big differences between takoyaki shops?
DE: Yes. What about you?
DL: I like fried foods, especially tonkatsu.
DE: Katsu sandwiches are also good.
DL: The crispy texture is great.
DE: Have you heard of Märchen?
DL: No. What kind of sandwiches do they have?

DE: Strawberries, mandarins, pineapples, and Shine Muscat grapes.
DL: Shine Muscat grapes? Interesting.

DL: Locations?

3,"DL: Good evening! Nice to meet you.  
DU: Good evening. Thank you in advance.  
DL: Have you had anything pleasant happen recently?  
DU: Is it something exciting? Hmm. If it's something to look forward to, I have plans for a weekend camp festival.  
DL: Is it a camping festival? Does it mean various people camp at the same place?  
DU: That's right. And on top of that, it's like a music festival.  
DL: Music too? Are various artists participating?  
DU: It seems that various famous people, including reggae artists, will be coming. It's my first festival ever.  
DL: During the day you can camp, and at night you can enjoy music, right? It sounds really fun!  
DU: If I had to say, it feels like we can enjoy music and shopping all day and then sleep in a tent at night!  
DL: I've never been camping before. Do you often go camping?  
DU: I started at the end of last year, so my camping experience is still short.  
DL: At the end of the year? Was there some kind of trigger or something?  
DU: My husband has always wanted to do it, but I wasn't enthusiastic about it. But when I saw my friends doing it, I became interested.  
DL: How was it when you actually tried it? Did you feel like you enjoyed it more than you expected?  
DU: That's right. And I fell into the camping obsession. I can't stop wanting more gear.  
DL: What kind of things do you want now?  
DU: Actually, it's a tent, but since I already have three kinds and there's a storage problem, it's a bit of a dilemma.  
DL: Three types? Even though there are so many, you still want them. Do they have some amazing features?  
DU: No. It might be the difference in appearance or size.  
DL: I see. Do you mean you want to use them according to their purpose?  
DU: Yes. Initially, I thought it would be like a disaster drill if I could sleep in a tent. But now, I feel like I want to differentiate between them.  
DL: It seems you are steadily getting stuck in the swamp.  
DU: It's troubling.  
DL: By the way, do tents cost quite a bit?  
DU: It's quite varied. I started with a cheap pop-up tent under 20,000 yen.  
DL: To say that 20,000 yen is cheap... does that mean there are more expensive things than that?  
DU: I see. If it's expensive, it exceeds 100,000 yen. It's unaffordable.  
DL: Wow! Once you get particular about it, it really seems like you won't be able to stop!  
DU: One-touch is spacious and can accommodate 4-5 people sleeping, so I recommend it. See you later.",1,15,15,15,15
