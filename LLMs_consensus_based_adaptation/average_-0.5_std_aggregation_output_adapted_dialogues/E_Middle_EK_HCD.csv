1,"EK: Good evening!  
CN: Good evening!  
EK: Do you have any part-time job experience?  
CN: Yes, at restaurants and Uniqlo.  
EK: Oh, Uniqlo! That’s great!  
CN: Part-time jobs can be challenging. I quit because it was demanding.  
EK: I see. Was it due to constant movement?  
CN: Yes, we had to follow rules like not walking slowly in front of customers.  
EK: Why can’t you walk slowly?  
CN: It was to ensure efficiency.  
EK: I might quit too if that were the case.  
CN: It’s about providing a pleasant shopping experience efficiently.  
EK: But it’s difficult to talk to staff if they’re rushing.  
CN: True, but it helps keep the store looking active and clean.  
EK: A balance is probably needed. I experienced something similar.  
CN: Really? In what way?  
EK: I worked at a moving company and had to run while working.  
CN: That must have been tough!  
EK: It was, but it felt like good training.  
CN: Did your body change because of it?  
EK: Not much, but carrying heavy items like refrigerators was satisfying.  
CN: Do muscles actually rejoice?  
EK: Yes, it felt good in a strange way.  
CN: That’s surprising! I mostly stay indoors.  
EK: The muscle pain was intense, but memorable.  
CN: Interesting how people’s work preferences vary.  
EK: It’s the endorphins. If you got a part-time job, what would it be?  
CN: I’d like to work at an art museum because I love paintings.  
EK: That sounds perfect. Enjoying work is important.  
CN: Absolutely, enjoying work is the best! Let’s keep at it!",6,15,15,15,15
2,"EK: Hello!

DK: Hello!

EK: Nice to meet you. Are you off today?

DK: Yes, I am. I was doing laundry and relaxing.

EK: A relaxing weekend sounds great. Do you go anywhere on your days off?

DK: I tend to stay in more since the COVID-19 pandemic.

EK: I see. I'm the opposite.

DK: Where do you go on your days off?

EK: I like to go shopping and take my time.

DK: That sounds enjoyable. I prefer browsing electronics stores and home centers, usually on weekdays.

EK: I enjoy electronics stores too. Sometimes I just walk around without a specific goal.

DK: Discovering new things is interesting, though I avoid impulse buys.

EK: Have you bought any new electronic appliances recently?

DK: Last year, I replaced a round fluorescent light with an LED.

EK: It’s really bright, isn’t it? We switched ours recently too.

DK: Yes, no special installation needed, it’s remote-controlled, and the power consumption is halved.

EK: It’s a convenient world indeed, though choosing products can be challenging.

DK: Visiting electronics retail stores helps.

EK: Even smartphone charging cables come in dozens of varieties.

DK: So many choices, even at the 100 yen shop. It can be overwhelming.

EK: I visited a 100 yen shop recently for the first time in years and was surprised by how much it had evolved!

DK: Yes, products priced at 200 yen or 300 yen have been increasing lately.

EK: True. The quality of the products is much better now.

DK: Yes, online information makes cost-effective products popular while others fade away.

EK: Absolutely, that’s significant.

DK: Articles and videos about using 100 yen shop items creatively are popular.

EK: I check YouTube reviews when I buy something.

DK: I understand. If I'm interested in a product, I look up reviews.

EK: That’s important. We want to use functional products for a long time.

DK: Yes, that’s correct. I buy good products repeatedly. Thank you.",4,15,15,15,15
3,"EK: Hello!
DK: Hello!
EK: Nice to meet you! Have you been interested in anything lately?
DK: ""Let's see... I've been watching soccer for over 10 years now, mostly through streaming.""
EK: That's interesting! Do you play it yourself too?
DK: I haven't played sports, even during school. I prefer watching and enjoy various sports.
EK: ""What other sports do you watch, for example?""
DK: Speaking of Winter Olympic sports, I watched curling a lot.
EK: You seem to like team sports!
DK: Yes, curling is quite engaging to watch on TV.
EK: ""Is it because you can see it from different angles?""
DK: That's part of it. In curling, players wear microphones, and their discussions are broadcasted.
EK: ""That's fascinating!""
DK: It’s interesting to hear the players' thoughts. Do you participate in any sports recently?
EK: ""I mostly train at the gym. I enjoy exercising.""
DK: I used to do strength training at the gym, but I stopped. What’s your routine like?
EK: I used to focus on muscle hypertrophy but switched my goals.
DK: What do you mean by the opposite of muscle hypertrophy?
EK: ""I aim for functional muscle now.""
DK: More practical training? What exercises do you do?
EK: ""I do bench presses focusing on reps, and wire exercises at lighter weights and faster speeds.""
DK: That sounds intense. I don’t have much muscle.
EK: ""I also emphasize aerobic exercise. I've lost about 10 kilograms from running, and I feel much better.""
DK: 10 kilograms! How long did it take you?
EK: It took about half a year.
DK: That seems healthy.
EK: I prefer burning calories through exercise rather than diet restrictions.
DK: ""That's great, but it can be hard to maintain.""
EK: The key is to keep it easy and not too burdensome.
DK: I understand! I'll try to follow your advice. Thanks!",2,15,15,15,15
4,"EK: Hi.
DQ: Hello.
EK: Did you go anywhere this summer?
DQ: I visited my parents and went to a river.
EK: Did you swim?
DQ: The kids did, but the water was cold.
EK: Rivers are cold. Was it a mountain stream?
DQ: No, it was slow-moving and U-shaped.
EK: Sounds clean and nice.
DQ: Yes, I brought my dog too.
EK: What breed?
DQ: German and Belgian shepherds.
EK: Big dogs.
DQ: Yes, 33kg and 23kg.
EK: That’s quite heavy.
DQ: Yes, but they are cute.
EK: I love dogs. I'd like one someday.
DQ: Any favorite breed?
EK: Shiba. They're adorable.
DQ: Mameshibas are cute and small.
EK: Yes, but I’m often away from home.
DQ: Pets need attention.
EK: True. Time is crucial.
DQ: I don't go out much either.
EK: Understandable. Big dogs must make your home lively.
DQ: Yes, and we have a cat too.
EK: Your home sounds like a little zoo.
DQ: It's like pet therapy for the kids.
EK: That must make home happy.
DQ: It does. Pets bring joy.",21,15,15,15,15
5,"EK: Hello!
DQ: Hello!
EK: Is there anything you've been into lately?
DQ: I have some free time and feel like spending it on reading.
EK: I see. What kind of books do you read?
DQ: I often read light novels with my children, but personally, I like stories with swordsmen. Currently, I'm reading ""Hakkenden.""
EK: Your child reads too, right? I also read novels a bit.
DQ: What kind do you like?
EK: I enjoy books by Keigo Higashino.
DQ: Certainly! I really like his work too.
EK: Once you start reading, you read it all at once, don't you?
DQ: That's right.
EK: I was originally not good at reading, but when I first saw his books, I found them interesting.
DQ: They are interesting. Yesterday, I borrowed the latest volume of the Kaga series from the library.
EK: That sounds interesting too. Do you have any recommendations?
DQ: I personally like ""Guardian of the Camphor Tree.""
EK: I have never read that.
DQ: It might be a bit minor, but I want my children to read it.
EK: The title alone seems interesting.
DQ: It's a bit unrealistic, but it also touches on modern issues. I recommend it.
EK: I'll try buying it the next time I go to the bookstore.
DQ: Sure. Our place is basically the library, but you often have to wait.
EK: I like seeing the books I've read increasing on my bookshelf, so I end up buying them impulsively.
DQ: Understood. My eldest daughter is like that, but we're running out of space.
EK: When there are too many, that's what happens. What do you think about e-books?
DQ: My family liked them and used them, but I can't quite remember the name of the one we used.
EK: It's inconvenient not to have physical copies, right? It's convenient, but I still prefer paper.
DQ: I am definitely a paper person too.
EK: The feeling of turning pages, the smell... all of those are part of the reading experience.
DQ: I understand. Kids read on their phones, but it's still about paper for me.",1,15,15,15,15

DQ: Premium Malts or Ebisu.  
EK: Me too! It's great to enjoy quality beer.  
DQ: Definitely. I like to savor a good beer.  
EK: Same here. I like variety, but always return to these.  
DQ: The draft beer atmosphere makes most beers enjoyable.  
EK: Yes, more places are serving craft beer now.  
DQ: Prices make me hesitant sometimes.  
EK: True, it's expensive and risky with unknown brands.  
DQ: Belgian beer or dark beer are fine.  
EK: I'd love to try Belgian beer in Belgium someday!  
DQ: I'd like to drink white beer there.  
EK: Yeast beer might taste better there.  
DQ: Is it good at room temperature?  
EK: Not sure. I'd prefer it chilled.  
DQ: Chilling the glass is ideal.  
EK: I lived in Germany; it was a beer paradise.  
DQ: I was in Germany for 4 weeks; it was enjoyable.  
EK: Lots of beer options and great atmosphere!
