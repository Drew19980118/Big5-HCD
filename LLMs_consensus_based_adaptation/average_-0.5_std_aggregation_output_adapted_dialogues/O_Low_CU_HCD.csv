ED: Hi! How can I help you today?
CU: This summer was really hot, right?
ED: Yes, it was. Did you stay cool?
CU: I went to an outdoor music festival and got heatstroke.
ED: That sounds difficult. Are you okay now?
CU: I felt headache and nausea after five hours without shade.
ED: That sounds tough. Did you recover after resting?
CU: Yes, I felt better after resting.
ED: Was it a daytime event?
CU: Yes, it was from morning to night. Very tiring.
ED: Did you have a good time overall?
CU: Yes, it was crowded. Did you travel anywhere special?
ED: I went to Karuizawa in July.
CU: Karuizawa? How was it?
ED: It was over 30 degrees, quite hot.
CU: Even Karuizawa is hot. Why did you go?
ED: My brother’s wedding.
CU: Congratulations! Where was it held?
ED: At the Stone Church of Hoshino Resorts.
CU: I know that place. It’s beautiful.
ED: Yes, it is.
CU: The food must have been good.
ED: Yes, it was.
CU: I’d love to visit someday.
ED: It’s worth it.
CU: I live in Kansai, so it's hard to get there.
ED: I'm also from Kansai. Easier from Tokyo.
CU: You're from Kansai too! That’s great.
ED: Yes, I traveled via Nagoya.",24,15,15,15,15
2,"CU: Thank you in advance.  
ED: You’re welcome.  
CU: Do you have any new hobbies?  
ED: Yes, jigsaw puzzles.  
CU: Is it a large one?  
ED: It's 1000 pieces, manageable.  
CU: Does it take up much of your time?  
ED: Yes, it can be quite time-consuming.  
CU: Do you have many completed puzzles?  
ED: Yes, I have several.  
CU: What do you do with them after completion?  
ED: Do you also do puzzles?  
CU: I’ve tried a few times.  
ED: I usually dismantle and store them.  
CU: Doesn’t that feel like a waste?  
ED: I only keep the ones I really love.  
CU: Makes sense. I should try puzzling again.  
ED: It’s relaxing in an air-conditioned room.  
CU: Seems like a good hobby.  
ED: Yes, it is. Any new interests for you?  
CU: I’m into K-pop groups recently.  
ED: Like BTS?

3,"CU: Good evening!  
ED: Good evening!  
CU: Do you have any pets?  
ED: No, I don't. Do you?  
CU: Yes, I have one dog.  
ED: What breed is it?  
CU: Do you know the dog breed called Cavalier?  
ED: I am not familiar with it. Is it a rare breed?  
CU: Maybe. It's a small to medium-sized dog with floppy ears.  
ED: I just checked online. Is it one of the dogs from 101 Dalmatians?  
CU: That could be. It's a gentle and cute breed, but they shed a lot.  
ED: Those floppy ears are adorable. It seems to have a lot of fur. How old is it?  
CU: It is 6 years old.  
ED: So, it's a bit of a senior citizen! But dogs are wonderful. I’d like to have one someday.  
CU: What kind of dog do you like?  
ED: I like bigger dogs, and also Shiba Inus.  
CU: I love big dogs too, but it's hard to take care of them.  
ED: My cousin had a Siberian Husky, and it was really cute!  
CU: Huskies are adorable, aren't they? Are they friendly?  
ED: Yes, even though they look like wolves, they are very affectionate!  
CU: That contrast is charming, isn't it?  
ED: Yes, but they shed a lot in the summer.  
CU: We deal with that too. July is the peak and it's challenging.  
ED: It must be tough. It’s probably because of the heat.  
CU: The Roomba gets full quickly.  
ED: Pets are very soothing.  
CU: Yes, they are. I hope you get to have one someday.  
ED: I would love that, but my work requires me to be away from home for long periods.  
CU: That is a tough situation.  
ED: Yes, it’s difficult to leave them alone.",3,15,15,15,15

5,"CU: Hello!  
DN: Hello. Nice to meet you.  
CU: Have you traveled anywhere recently?  
DN: I haven't traveled, but I often go to the Kansai region on weekends.  
CU: That’s interesting. I live in the Kansai region. Where did you go?  
DN: I often go to Nishinomiya on weekends.  
CU: Nishinomiya! Any specific places you visit?  
DN: I study music and visit my son in Mita.  
CU: Is your job related to music?  
DN: No, I aim to be a musician. I’m from Nagoya and can’t find good teachers here.  
CU: That’s amazing! I also play the piano as a hobby and love music.  
DN: I study the harpsichord, which is lighter than a piano.  
CU: The harpsichord sounds wonderful.  
DN: I can't play Chopin, but Bach sounds nice on the harpsichord.  
CU: Bach is perfect for the harpsichord. Do you have one at home?  
DN: Yes. What do you play on the piano?  
CU: I’m at an intermediate level, practicing Chopin and Debussy.  
DN: I love both, but they’re not suited for the harpsichord.  
CU: Speaking of which, I recently visited the Yamaha piano factory in Kakegawa.  
DN: There are many music-related factories and concert halls in Shizuoka, correct?  
CU: Yes, there was a harpsichord on display, and I tried it a little.  
DN: Was it a large harpsichord?  
CU: No, it was small.  
DN: Yamaha also displays harpsichords, not just Kawai.  
CU: Is a harpsichord expensive?  
DN: Yes. A Kawai harpsichord costs around 2 million yen.  
CU: That’s almost the price of a grand piano.  
DN: The ones from overseas are even more expensive.  
CU: That’s quite a range. Keep practicing hard.  
DN: Thank you. Keep up with your piano practice.",3,15,15,15,15
