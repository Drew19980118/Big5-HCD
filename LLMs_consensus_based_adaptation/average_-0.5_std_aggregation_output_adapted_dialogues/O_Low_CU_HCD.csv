ED: Hi! How can I help you today?
CU: This summer was really hot, right?
ED: Yes, it was. Did you stay cool?
CU: I went to an outdoor music festival and got heatstroke.
ED: That sounds difficult. Are you okay now?
CU: I felt headache and nausea after five hours without shade.
ED: That sounds tough. Did you recover after resting?
CU: Yes, I felt better after resting.
ED: Was it a daytime event?
CU: Yes, it was from morning to night. Very tiring.
ED: Did you have a good time overall?
CU: Yes, it was crowded. Did you travel anywhere special?
ED: I went to Karuizawa in July.
CU: Karuizawa? How was it?
ED: It was over 30 degrees, quite hot.
CU: Even Karuizawa is hot. Why did you go?
ED: My brother’s wedding.
CU: Congratulations! Where was it held?
ED: At the Stone Church of Hoshino Resorts.
CU: I know that place. It’s beautiful.
ED: Yes, it is.
CU: The food must have been good.
ED: Yes, it was.
CU: I’d love to visit someday.
ED: It’s worth it.
CU: I live in Kansai, so it's hard to get there.
ED: I'm also from Kansai. Easier from Tokyo.
CU: You're from Kansai too! That’s great.
ED: Yes, I traveled via Nagoya.",24,15,15,15,15
2,"CU: Thank you in advance.  
ED: You’re welcome.  
CU: Do you have any new hobbies?  
ED: Yes, jigsaw puzzles.  
CU: Is it a large one?  
ED: It's 1000 pieces, manageable.  
CU: Does it take up much of your time?  
ED: Yes, it can be quite time-consuming.  
CU: Do you have many completed puzzles?  
ED: Yes, I have several.  
CU: What do you do with them after completion?  
ED: Do you also do puzzles?  
CU: I’ve tried a few times.  
ED: I usually dismantle and store them.  
CU: Doesn’t that feel like a waste?  
ED: I only keep the ones I really love.  
CU: Makes sense. I should try puzzling again.  
ED: It’s relaxing in an air-conditioned room.  
CU: Seems like a good hobby.  
ED: Yes, it is. Any new interests for you?  
CU: I’m into K-pop groups recently.  
ED: Like BTS?

ED: Good evening!  
CU: Do you have any pets?  
ED: No, I don't. Do you?  
CU: Yes, I have one dog.  
ED: What breed is it?  
CU: Do you know the dog breed called Cavalier?  
ED: I am not familiar with it. Is it a rare breed?  
CU: Maybe. It's a small to medium-sized dog with floppy ears.  
ED: I just checked online. Is it one of the dogs from 101 Dalmatians?  
CU: That could be. It's a gentle and cute breed, but they shed a lot.  
ED: Those floppy ears are adorable. It seems to have a lot of fur. How old is it?  
CU: It is 6 years old.  
ED: So, it's a bit of a senior citizen! But dogs are wonderful. I’d like to have one someday.  
CU: What kind of dog do you like?  
ED: I like bigger dogs, and also Shiba Inus.  
CU: I love big dogs too, but it's hard to take care of them.  
ED: My cousin had a Siberian Husky, and it was really cute!  
CU: Huskies are adorable, aren't they? Are they friendly?  
ED: Yes, even though they look like wolves, they are very affectionate!  
CU: That contrast is charming, isn't it?  
ED: Yes, but they shed a lot in the summer.  
CU: We deal with that too. July is the peak and it's challenging.  
ED: It must be tough. It’s probably because of the heat.  
CU: The Roomba gets full quickly.  
ED: Pets are very soothing.  
CU: Yes, they are. I hope you get to have one someday.  
ED: I would love that, but my work requires me to be away from home for long periods.  
CU: That is a tough situation.  
ED: Yes, it’s difficult to leave them alone.",3,15,15,15,15

DN: Yes, very hot.

CU: Were you outside today?

DN: Yes, working all day.

CU: Nice job! Is your work usually indoors?

DN: Yes, air-conditioning helps.

CU: It’s tough managing the heat.

DN: Do you leave early?

CU: No, I leave at 8 o’clock.

DN: Cooler than later.

CU: Yes. I went to an outdoor festival last week and got heatstroke.

DN: What kind of festival?

DN: No. Tell me more.

CU: A music event with many famous artists.

DN: Which artists?

CU: Yuri and Motohiro Hata.

DN: Not familiar.

CU: It was fun but very hot.

DN: Did you wear a mask?

CU: Yes, but rules weren’t strict outside.

DN: Was it in a dome?

CU: No, under the sun. Umbrellas were prohibited, so I used a hat.

DN: A sturdy hat is a must.

CU: Yes, some people collapsed. The heat is severe.

DN: Did you stand throughout?

CU: Only for artists I wanted to see.

DN: Thanks for sharing.",12,15,15,15,15
5,"CU: Hello!  
DN: Hello. Nice to meet you.  
CU: Have you traveled anywhere recently?  
DN: I haven't traveled, but I often go to the Kansai region on weekends.  
CU: That’s interesting. I live in the Kansai region. Where did you go?  
DN: I often go to Nishinomiya on weekends.  
CU: Nishinomiya! Any specific places you visit?  
DN: I study music and visit my son in Mita.  
CU: Is your job related to music?  
DN: No, I aim to be a musician. I’m from Nagoya and can’t find good teachers here.  
CU: That’s amazing! I also play the piano as a hobby and love music.  
DN: I study the harpsichord, which is lighter than a piano.  
CU: The harpsichord sounds wonderful.  
DN: I can't play Chopin, but Bach sounds nice on the harpsichord.  
CU: Bach is perfect for the harpsichord. Do you have one at home?  
DN: Yes. What do you play on the piano?  
CU: I’m at an intermediate level, practicing Chopin and Debussy.  
DN: I love both, but they’re not suited for the harpsichord.  
CU: Speaking of which, I recently visited the Yamaha piano factory in Kakegawa.  
DN: There are many music-related factories and concert halls in Shizuoka, correct?  
CU: Yes, there was a harpsichord on display, and I tried it a little.  
DN: Was it a large harpsichord?  
CU: No, it was small.  
DN: Yamaha also displays harpsichords, not just Kawai.  
CU: Is a harpsichord expensive?  
DN: Yes. A Kawai harpsichord costs around 2 million yen.  
CU: That’s almost the price of a grand piano.  
DN: The ones from overseas are even more expensive.  
CU: That’s quite a range. Keep practicing hard.  
DN: Thank you. Keep up with your piano practice.",3,15,15,15,15
6,"CU: Good evening!
DN: Good evening. How can I assist you tonight?
CU: Have you chosen tonight's dinner?
DN: We'll eat out tonight.
CU: Are you all going together?
DN: Yes, my college-aged son is home for the holidays, so the three of us will go out.
CU: That's wonderful. Spending time together is always special. What type of restaurant are you considering?
DN: Either shabu-shabu or yakiniku.
CU: Both are excellent choices! Young people really do love meat. Enjoy whichever you choose.
DN: Yes, and I want my son to decide.
CU: Does having him home make you feel more relaxed?
DN: Yes, it reduces my worries when he's around.
CU: I understand. It must be comforting to have him nearby. Children always hold a special place in their mother's heart.
DN: Do your children still live with you?
CU: Yes, they're in junior high. It's hard to think about them leaving someday, but it's part of their growth.
DN: I used to act strong, but now I try to show some vulnerability.
CU: Did that change your sons' behavior?
DN: Yes, they felt they needed to be strong because of it.
CU: Balancing being responsible and showing vulnerability is tough, but it's important. We want them to be strong yet empathetic.
DN: Mothers often feel the need to be dependable.
CU: Sometimes, being too strong has unintended effects.
DN: Yes, it can. A teacher once told the boys to value their pride.
CU: Boys really do hold pride in high regard. It's something they grow up valuing.
DN: Yes, although practical skills matter more to me, boys see it differently.
CU: Boys and girls do have different perspectives.
DN: Yes, they do. I need to show some vulnerability.
CU: My child has become more reliable, so I'll try to depend on him a bit more. It's a good way to help them grow.
DN: Yes, just a little vulnerability can help. It's important not to overdo it.
CU: Finding the right balance is hard. It's all about trial and error.
DN: Yes, it is. I'll keep working on it!",16,15,15,15,15

BH: Good morning. How can I assist you today?
CU: How's the weather there today?
BH: It's getting cloudy. Rain might start soon.
CU: Rain is forecast here too. This summer was really hot, wasn't it?
BH: Yes, it was. Did you prepare for the heat?
CU: I went to an outdoor music festival last week and got ready for it.
BH: What kind of preparations did you make?
CU: Have you heard about the cooling gel ring developed by NASA? It freezes at 28 degrees.
BH: I don't have information on that. Does it freeze at 28 degrees Celsius?
CU: Yes, it turns into a cooling gel and you can wrap it around your neck.
BH: Did it work well for you?
CU: It lasted for about an hour and a half, so it was effective.
BH: Have you considered using cooling towels from the 100 yen shop?
CU: Yes, but do they get the clothes wet?
BH: It depends on how you wrap it. Some users report their clothes getting soaked.
CU: Wrapping is crucial. Did you go somewhere with your son recently?
BH: Yes, we went to a hospital visit.
CU: It's easy to get drenched in sweat quickly.
BH: I just returned from shopping and had to change all my clothes.
CU: Daily laundry is tough.
BH: Yes, it is frustrating when it rains and I have laundry hanging out.
CU: We use a drum-type machine that also dries clothes.
BH: Many clothes can't be dried in a machine.
CU: Clothes that wrinkle can't be machine dried.
BH: Correct. Printed clothes often stick together and get damaged.
CU: Printed clothes do stick together.
BH: Switching to a drum-type machine has made things easier.
CU: It helps when you're in a hurry.
BH: The fluffiness of towels cannot be restored in a machine.",8,15,15,15,15

BH: Hello!  
CU: Do you have any favorite foods or dishes?  
BH: I like spicy food. I also like shrimp, so dishes like shrimp with chili sauce are the best.  
CU: Ebi chili is delicious, isn't it! I also like spicy food and I'm really into Korean cuisine.  
BH: Is it often made?  
CU: I've been making it often recently.  
BH: Could you please tell me what you are making?  
CU: Samgyeopsal, chijimi, and tteokbokki. Do you know them?  
BH: I also make Korean pancakes sometimes. Though I use pre-mixed flour.  
CU: I use chijimi flour too. The tteokbokki is also from a kit.  
BH: Such a thing exists? Can it be made easily?  
CU: It's very easy! But it might be too spicy for kids.  
BH: I see. My daughter who loves spicy food might be okay.  
CU: That’s great! You should give it a try and buy it.  
BH: I'm interested! I'll look for it. Is it sold in regular supermarkets?  
CU: They’ve been available in supermarkets recently!  
BH: That would be helpful. I'm going shopping today, so I'll look for it.  
CU: Samgyeopsal is easy to make and popular with children too.  
BH: Is it just grilling pork?  
CU: Yes, and we make something called samjang, which is like a sweet and spicy miso.  
BH: Is what you are making also being sold?  
CU: They sell it, but you can make it with gochujang and seasonings at home.  
BH: I see. I will look into that as well.  
CU: The rest, we wrap the meat with things like seasoned bean sprouts, shredded green onions, and kimchi in lettuce or perilla leaves and eat it.  
BH: I'm getting hungry. I'm in the mood for Korean food, so I might go for that tonight.  
CU: Please do!  
BH: However, there is a problem; my son is not good with spicy food.  
CU: The only spicy one is the ssamjang, so you could prepare two types, one without gochujang.  
BH: So it can work without it. Thank you for the information.",1,15,15,15,15
