FE: I admire people who can play the piano. I took lessons until second grade, but I can't play anymore.  
GS: Does it feel like something from a long time ago?  
FE: That’s right. I remember quitting because my fingers were short.  
GS: If your fingers are short, it's quite difficult to play octaves, isn't it?

GS: ""There are a lot of difficult pieces, right? What kind of pieces did you play?""

GS: ""It's insanely difficult! Do you know the YouTuber named CANACANA?""  
FE: I know.  
GS: I was trying to play exactly what that person arranged.  
FE: Isn't this too difficult?  
GS: ""It's too difficult. I managed to play all of it eventually, but then I gave up...""  
FE: It's impressive that you even tried.  
GS: No, no. If I had a little more time, I might have worked harder on the second one.  
FE: It’s amazing. What are you practicing now?  
GS: I don't have a piano at home right now, so I haven't been able to make much progress.
