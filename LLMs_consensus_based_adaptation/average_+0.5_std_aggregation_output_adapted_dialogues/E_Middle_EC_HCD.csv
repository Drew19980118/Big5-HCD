1,"EC: Hello
DG: Hi there! How can I help you today?
EC: Cooking every day has become a hassle. Do you have any simple and popular dish recommendations?
DG: Sure! I’ve been eating a lot of somen noodles lately and trying different variations.
EC: That sounds interesting. What kind of variations can you make with somen?
DG: You can try minced meat miso, similar to tantanmen, or mix it with tomatoes for an Italian twist.
EC: Delicious! Do you put the meat miso and tantanmen sauce directly on the somen noodles?
DG: Yes, exactly. Sometimes I prepare it in advance and just add it on top. For dan dan noodles, I sometimes use store-bought ones.
EC: That’s convenient! Changing flavors seems to keep somen noodles exciting.
DG: Definitely. I also tried a chijimi (Korean pancake) recipe from COOKPAD. It was really good.
EC: How do you make that? I’m curious about the taste and texture.
DG: I chopped boiled somen and added potato starch. It made the pancake chewy.
EC: That sounds great! I’d like to try it.
DG: Adding green onions improved the flavor a lot.
EC: Green onions are fantastic. I’ve got tomorrow’s dinner sorted. Thanks!
DG: No problem. Cookpad is really handy for recipes.
EC: Does Cookpad ever give you recipes that don’t turn out well?
DG: Occasionally, especially if you don’t follow the measurements exactly.
EC: You seem to pick good recipes. I often choose the wrong ones and hesitate to try new things.
DG: Have you had any big fails with recipes?
EC: Once, I tried a rice cooker cake with canned peaches. It turned out mushy.
DG: That must have been disappointing.
EC: Yes, it was. I probably made a mistake, but it was still a letdown.
DG: I’ve never tried a rice cooker cake, but I guess it depends on the machine. It’s quite frustrating.
EC: The anticipation makes failure even harder to handle.
DG: Absolutely. You can’t check the progress with a rice cooker, which can be tough.
EC: Another letdown was a cheesecake made with pizza cheese. It didn’t taste good.
DG: You make a lot of sweets! That’s impressive.
EC: Thanks. I’ll try to avoid likely failures and focus on recipes I can succeed with.
DG: Good plan. Sometimes it’s best to stick with safer choices.",2
2,"EC: Hello!
DG: Hello!
EC: Do you have any siblings?
DG: I am an only child. It can feel lonely at times.
EC: I see. When I was little, I used to wish I were an only child.
DG: How many siblings do you have?
EC: I have one younger sister. We used to fight a lot when we were younger, but now we get along well.
DG: Being alone as an adult can definitely feel lonely.
EC: If you could have siblings, would you prefer a sister?
DG: Maybe, but it might have been complicated.
EC: You might feel a bit jealous of your sibling's partner.
DG: My friend finds it challenging being close to their single sibling.
EC: Being very close can indeed be difficult. It might feel like a romantic partner isn’t needed.
DG: They understand each other well, but it can be concerning at times.
EC: Being very understanding is unique. I understand your concern.
DG: Do you meet your sister often?
EC: Not very often. We mostly communicate through LINE and other means.
DG: It must be enjoyable to discuss various things.
EC: Yes, it is. Our family has a daughter and a son, and their future relationship is a mystery.
DG: It's important to maintain good relationships.
EC: I hope they get along, but their fights sometimes make me worry.
DG: My friend who fought with their sibling a lot changed over time.
EC: That's surprising. I thought they always got along.
DG: They used to be an object of fear. Growing up changes people.
EC: It's amazing how people change.
DG: If I have children, I would like to have two.
EC: If you have the means, a larger family could be nice.
DG: It would cost more though. Something to think about.
EC: Dreams expand! Thank you!
DG: You're welcome!",5
3,"EC: Hello. Nice to meet you.
AF: Hello. How can I assist you today?
EC: When I was parking, I accidentally hit the car and my mood dropped.
AF: I'm sorry to hear that. Was it a new car?
EC: No, it was a used car from the beginning. But I'm worried about the repair costs.
AF: Was the damage significant?
EC: It's not very big, but even to an amateur, it's clear that the parts are misaligned.
AF: Visible damage can be concerning.
EC: That's right. I'm also worried that the parts might slip and fall off.
AF: Have you experienced car repairs before?
EC: It's your parents' car, right? Did you get scolded?
AF: I initially claimed it was hit while parked, but they knew I caused it.
EC: Understood.
AF: They thought I caused it because I was a beginner.
EC: Parental intuition is impressive.
AF: Yes. I caused significant damage like a hanging door mirror.
EC: A hanging mirror would be very upsetting if it were a new car.
AF: It was alarming at the moment it happened.
EC: I understand.
AF: Do you have any plans to go for a drive?
EC: I don't have plans to go for a drive. Do you?
AF: You can plan an overnight trip during the summer vacation.
EC: Understood. I'm sure it will be enjoyable.
AF: Staying without meals and finding local restaurants can be efficient.
EC: That sounds exciting.
AF: Saving on hotel costs and enjoying the journey is effective.
EC: I understand. Thank you for today.
AF: Thank you. Have a great day.",8
4,"EC: Hello, thank you for your time today.  
AF: You're welcome. How can I assist you?  
EC: The situation with Corona is quite concerning, isn't it?  
AF: Yes. Wearing masks in the heat can be challenging.  
EC: It feels like it increases the risk of heatstroke.  
AF: I worry about that too.  
EC: Not wearing a mask can also cause discomfort.  
AF: Have you noticed fewer people wearing masks outdoors?  
EC: In the countryside, many still wear masks due to COVID-19 concerns.  
AF: In my area, mask-wearing has decreased among the elderly.  
EC: Interesting. It’s changing gradually.  
AF: I recently stopped wearing a mask outdoors and feel less conscious.  
EC: That's positive. It might reduce heatstroke risk.  
AF: This year, I bought a parasol for children because it was so hot.  
EC: Do children use parasols when commuting to school?  
AF: Some do.  
EC: Commuting in this heat must be hard.  
AF: I use a parasol on the way back home.  
EC: The heat is more intense then. It's good to stay cooler.  
AF: Children's parasols are light and effective.  
EC: I'll check them out at the store.  
AF: They're affordable.  
EC: Are you doing anything else to prevent heatstroke?  
AF: I use a cooling towel around my neck daily.  
EC: Does it make your neck wet?  
AF: It dries quickly in summer.  
EC: That sounds useful.  
AF: It's also good for adults during housework.  
EC: Thanks for the tips.  
AF: You're welcome.",6
5,"EC: Hello, nice to meet you!
AF: Hello, how can I assist you today?
EC: I've been thinking that I need to clean up the house, but I can't seem to get started.
AF: What specific areas are you looking to clean up?
EC: They are toys and children's clothes that are no longer used. They hold sentimental value, so it's hard to throw them away.
AF: Have you considered taking photos before disposing of these items?
EC: Photos might help. Do you have any experience with this?
AF: Yes, I take photos of items before disposal and organize them in an album.
EC: That sounds practical. Do you do this for crafts and works as well?
AF: Correct. I photograph crafts and store them in a digital album for easy access.
EC: Your method is efficient. Do you order prints of the photos immediately?
AF: Yes, I place an order online the same day or the next day to avoid backlog.
EC: Have you ever faced issues with throwing things away secretly?
AF: Generally, the focus is on the creation process rather than keeping the item.
EC: That makes sense. The joy is often in making the item.
AF: Precisely. The process can be the most enjoyable part.
EC: Especially with temporary materials like paper clay. I'll consider your approach.
AF: It should help keep your space organized.
EC: A tidy home is important. Messy rooms can be overwhelming.
AF: Agreed. You can also involve children by giving them a garbage bag for things they don't need.
EC: That's effective. In my house, everything seems to have sentimental value.
AF: It helps to regularly declutter. My method influences my child to do the same.
EC: Tidying habits do seem to be passed down. My parents also struggle with letting go.
AF: It appears to be a common trend. My mother was also a minimalist.
EC: Thank you for the advice.
AF: You're welcome.",4
6,"EC: Hello, nice to meet you.
AF: Hello.
EC: I'm considering buying a new computer. Can you tell me about your computer's specs?
AF: I don’t know the exact specs. It has the latest version of Windows.
EC: My devices often freeze or update slowly, which is frustrating.
AF: I buy cheap, used ones.
EC: You prefer second-hand? How do you choose where to buy them?
AF: I check Rakuten prices, then my husband verifies before buying.
EC: Your husband must be knowledgeable about computers.
AF: Yes, he handles it.
EC: I have to choose mine since I use it frequently.
AF: Consult with a store to help you decide.
EC: Good idea. Consulting with a store might reduce mistakes.
AF: Smartphones have high specs now and choosing is confusing.
EC: There are many options. I am interested in trying a Google Pixel.
AF: I recently replaced my smartphone.
EC: Which smartphone did you switch to?
AF: It’s the latest 5G from Tone Mobile. Not sure about 5G.
EC: I hear about 5G often. Doesn’t seem too exciting.
AF: It runs smoother than my old phone, but feels a bit wasteful.
EC: With 5G, you’d expect more speed, right?
AF: Does 5G affect speed? Didn’t know that.
EC: I thought so, but I’m not confident.
AF: Recent smartphone cameras are great.
EC: True! My phone’s zoom feature is disappointing.
AF: For serious photos, I use a digital single-lens reflex camera.
EC: Using the right tool is important.
AF: I don’t keep up with new technologies.
EC: I’m the same. Thank you!
AF: You’re welcome. Thank you!",2
7,"EC: Hello!  
AF: Hello, please.  
EC: Are you watching any TV shows or anime lately?  
AF: Yes, I'm watching Naruto and Bleach.  
EC: That's awesome! I want to watch them too.  
AF: Did you know?  
EC: Yes, I’ve read some of it, and I plan to binge-read it all someday.  
AF: Both have been adapted into anime and have been running for a long time.  
EC: Are both the manga and anime finished?  
AF: Naruto has been fully adapted into an anime.  
EC: Got it! I'm excited to watch it.  
AF: Naruto's main character is so endearing that I ended up feeling like a mother watching over his growth.  
EC: It's interesting seeing it from a mother's perspective!  
AF: That Naruto who was so small has grown up to be so strong—isn't that what you mean?  
EC: Exactly! Isn't there a sequel to Naruto?  
AF: The sequel is called 'Boruto: Naruto Next Generations'.  
EC: If Naruto were my child, I'd read it from a grandmother's perspective!  
AF: I was a bit surprised by Naruto's marriage partner!  
EC: I don't know yet! Is it an unexpected partner?  
AF: Okay, I'll keep it a secret! I just started watching Bleach recently.  
EC: Bankai is impressive, right?  
AF: Currently, Jujutsu Kaisen is popular, but I prefer Bleach.  
EC: I haven't watched Jujutsu Kaisen. Bleach is interesting because of its standout characters.  
AF: I quickly got hooked on Bleach, and I'm thinking I want to watch the movies too.  
EC: There's a movie too? I didn't know that.  
AF: Fukushi-kun and Hana-chan are playing the lead roles.  
EC: I'd love to see it! They should show it on Friday Roadshow.  
AF: You can also watch it on Netflix.  
EC: I don't have Netflix. I'll find a way to watch it someday! Thanks a lot.  
AF: The pleasure is mine, thank you.",2
8,"EC: Good evening!  
AF: Good evening! How can I assist you today?  
EC: Do you have your air conditioner cleaned every year? It's quite pricey, isn't it?  
AF: It's not necessary to clean it every year. Once every three years is usually sufficient.  
EC: Once every three years sounds reasonable. I was told by a company that it should be done yearly, and I was unsure about it.  
AF: It's also worth considering replacing the air conditioner instead of just cleaning it.  
EC: Air conditioners are quite expensive.  
AF: You could use a cleaning spray from the pharmacy for basic maintenance.  
EC: I've seen those sprays at the pharmacy. Do they clean well?  
AF: They should work, but there is a risk of damaging the unit.  
EC: That makes sense. The risk of breaking it is concerning.  
AF: Doing the maintenance yourself can save money.  
EC: I agree. Saving money is appealing.  
AF: The more you can do on your own, the more you save.  
EC: Are you good at saving money?  
AF: Instead of small savings, I invest.  
EC: Are you investing through something like NISA?  
AF: Yes, both NISA and iDeCo, within my savings limits.  
EC: That's impressive. How did you learn about investing?  
AF: I read books and learned through practical management.  
EC: You read the books and then put it into practice. Weren't you afraid of losses?  
AF: It's similar to shopping; sometimes you lose, but it's manageable.  
EC: That's a great way to look at it! It feels reassuring.  
AF: By staying within your financial means, losses are manageable.  
EC: I see. It's best to invest amounts you can afford to lose.  
AF: Exactly. Plus, I'm not very good at regular shopping and often make mistakes.  
EC: That makes sense! I'm starting to feel interested in investing.  
AF: While I can't broadly recommend it, investing with Rakuten Points is low-risk.  
EC: I've seen information about investing with Rakuten Points. I'll check it out! Thank you.  
AF: You're welcome. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask.",3
