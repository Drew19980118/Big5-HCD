1,"CU: Hello!
ED: Hello!
CU: This summer was really hot, wasn't it!
ED: Yes, it was very warm.
CU: I went to an outdoor music festival last weekend and ended up with heatstroke.
ED: Are you okay now?
CU: After being in a place without shade for about five hours, I got a headache and nausea.
ED: That sounds tough. Are you feeling better now?
CU: Yes, I felt better after resting in the infirmary.
ED: Good to hear. Was it during the day?
CU: Yes, it was an all-day event, and I got tired during the day.
ED: The crowd must have made it feel even hotter.
CU: Yes, it was very crowded, and it was easy to forget about COVID-19 precautions. Did you go anywhere recently?
ED: I went to Karuizawa in late July.
CU: Karuizawa? I've never been there. How was it?
ED: It was over 30 degrees. I expected it to be cooler.
CU: Even Karuizawa is hot. What did you do there?
ED: My younger brother had a wedding.
CU: Congratulations! Where was it?
ED: The Stone Church of Hoshino Resorts.
CU: I know that place. It's beautiful.
ED: Yes, it was wonderful.
CU: The food must have been good.
ED: Yes, it was delicious. I don’t often go to Hoshino Resort except for special occasions.
CU: I'd like to visit someday.
ED: It was hotter than expected but had a lot of nature.
CU: Since I live in the Kansai region, it's difficult for me to go to Karuizawa.
ED: I am also from Kansai. It’s more convenient from Tokyo.
CU: So you're from Kansai! I wish we lived closer so we could visit more often.
ED: Yes.",22,15,15,15,15

CU: Many completed puzzles at home?
ED: Yes, I stopped displaying them after a while.
CU: What do you do with a completed puzzle?
ED: Do you do puzzles?
CU: A few in the past.
ED: It is a dilemma. I break them down and put them away.
CU: Isn't it a waste to dismantle a complex puzzle?
ED: I only display the special ones.
CU: Understandable. I want to start a puzzle again!
ED: Puzzles are great in an air-conditioned room.
