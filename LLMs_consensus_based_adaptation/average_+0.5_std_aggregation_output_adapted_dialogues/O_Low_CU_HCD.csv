1,"CU: Hello!
ED: Hello!
CU: This summer was really hot, wasn't it!
ED: Yes, it was very warm.
CU: I went to an outdoor music festival last weekend and ended up with heatstroke.
ED: Are you okay now?
CU: After being in a place without shade for about five hours, I got a headache and nausea.
ED: That sounds tough. Are you feeling better now?
CU: Yes, I felt better after resting in the infirmary.
ED: Good to hear. Was it during the day?
CU: Yes, it was an all-day event, and I got tired during the day.
ED: The crowd must have made it feel even hotter.
CU: Yes, it was very crowded, and it was easy to forget about COVID-19 precautions. Did you go anywhere recently?
ED: I went to Karuizawa in late July.
CU: Karuizawa? I've never been there. How was it?
ED: It was over 30 degrees. I expected it to be cooler.
CU: Even Karuizawa is hot. What did you do there?
ED: My younger brother had a wedding.
CU: Congratulations! Where was it?
ED: The Stone Church of Hoshino Resorts.
CU: I know that place. It's beautiful.
ED: Yes, it was wonderful.
CU: The food must have been good.
ED: Yes, it was delicious. I don’t often go to Hoshino Resort except for special occasions.
CU: I'd like to visit someday.
ED: It was hotter than expected but had a lot of nature.
CU: Since I live in the Kansai region, it's difficult for me to go to Karuizawa.
ED: I am also from Kansai. It’s more convenient from Tokyo.
CU: So you're from Kansai! I wish we lived closer so we could visit more often.
ED: Yes.",22,15,15,15,15
2,"CU: Thank you in advance.
ED: You're welcome.
CU: Any hobbies or interests lately?
ED: Yes, I enjoy jigsaw puzzles.
CU: Interesting! Are you working on a large puzzle now?
ED: It's a 1000-piece puzzle, so not too large.
CU: Must be fun. Lose track of time?
ED: Yes, I often forget to eat.
CU: Many completed puzzles at home?
ED: Yes, I stopped displaying them after a while.
CU: What do you do with a completed puzzle?
ED: Do you do puzzles?
CU: A few in the past.
ED: It is a dilemma. I break them down and put them away.
CU: Isn't it a waste to dismantle a complex puzzle?
ED: I only display the special ones.
CU: Understandable. I want to start a puzzle again!
ED: Puzzles are great in an air-conditioned room.
CU: Agreed! It’s a great hobby.
ED: Thank you. Any hobbies recently?
CU: Yes, into K-pop groups lately.
ED: Like BTS?
CU: Yes, and especially their brother group, TXT.
ED: Heard they're very popular.
CU: They're trending! Lots of YouTube videos.
ED: There are K-pop dance schools now.
CU: Yes, kids in my neighborhood attend.
ED: A child I know goes too. Precise dance moves.
CU: Impressive! They have a bright future!
ED: Looking forward to seeing their progress. Enjoy your hobby!",2,15,15,15,15

ED: Good evening. How can I assist you?  
CU: Do you have any pets?  
ED: I do not. Do you have one?  
CU: Yes, I have a dog.  
ED: What breed is it?  
CU: Do you know the breed called Cavalier?  
ED: No. Is it rare?  
CU: It might be. It’s a small to medium-sized dog with floppy ears.  
ED: I checked. Is it in 101 Dalmatians?  
CU: Maybe. They’re gentle, cute, but shed a lot.  
ED: How old is your dog?  
CU: My dog is 6 years old.  
ED: Got it.  
CU: What kind of dog do you like?  
ED: Big breeds and Shiba Inus.  
CU: I love big dogs too, but they’re hard to keep.  
ED: My cousin had a Siberian Husky. It was cute.  
CU: Huskies are adorable and friendly.  
ED: Yes, they are affectionate.  
CU: That contrast is nice.  
ED: They shed a lot in summer.  
CU: We have that too. July is the worst.  
ED: Managing shedding can be challenging.  
CU: The Roomba fills up fast.  
ED: Pets provide comfort.  
CU: Yes, they are soothing.  
ED: My work keeps me away often.  
CU: That’s tough.  
ED: It’s hard to leave them with someone else.",9,15,15,15,15

DN: Hello. How can I assist you today?
CU: It's been a hot and humid day.
DN: Yes, it's quite hot here too. Were you outside today?
CU: Did you go outside today?
DN: Yes, I was out for work. How about you?
CU: Is your work indoors?
DN: Yes, I work in an air-conditioned environment. How can I help you with the heat?
CU: I'm finding it challenging to manage the heat.
DN: It can be tough. Do you leave early in the morning to avoid it?
CU: No, I leave at 8 o'clock. It’s still manageable at that time.
DN: That time is cooler than later in the day. Is there anything else I can assist with?
CU: Yes, that's right. I went to an outdoor festival last week and got heatstroke. It was intense.
DN: That sounds difficult. What kind of festival was it?
CU: A music festival called Summer Sonic. Have you heard of it?
DN: No, is Summer Sonic an event?
CU: Yes, many famous artists perform there. It’s a big deal!
DN: Can you name a few artists who performed?
CU: Do you know Yuri or Motohiro Hata?
DN: I'm not familiar with them. How was the experience despite the heat?
CU: It was enjoyable but extremely hot. Did you wear protective gear during the festival?
DN: Did you wear protective gear during the festival?
CU: Yes, but it wasn't too strict since it was outdoors.
DN: Was it under the sun all the time?
CU: Yes, no umbrellas allowed, only hats. It was tough.
DN: That sounds challenging. A sturdy hat would be necessary.
CU: Yes, the heat was severe this year.
DN: It must be hard to stand during performances in such heat.
CU: Only for the artists I want to see.
DN: Is there anything else you need assistance with?",22,15,15,15,15
5,"CU: Hello!
DN: Hello. How can I help you today?
CU: Have you traveled anywhere recently?
DN: I often visit the Kansai region on weekends.
CU: That's great! I live in Kansai too. Where do you usually go?
DN: Nishinomiya.
CU: Oh, Nishinomiya! What do you do there?
DN: I study music and visit my son.
CU: That sounds wonderful! Are you aiming to be a musician?
DN: Yes, I am.
CU: Wow, what instrument do you play?
DN: I study the harpsichord.
CU: The harpsichord has such a beautiful sound! I love it.
DN: Yes, it is perfect for Bach's pieces.
CU: Do you have a harpsichord at home too?
DN: Yes, I have one. What do you play on the piano?
CU: I love playing pieces by Chopin and Debussy. I'm practicing them now.
DN: They are wonderful composers.
CU: I visited the Yamaha piano factory in Kakegawa recently. It was so fascinating!
DN: How was your visit?
CU: There was a harpsichord on display, and I even tried playing it a bit.
DN: Was it large?
CU: No, it was a smaller one.
DN: It's interesting that Yamaha displays harpsichords.
CU: Are harpsichords generally expensive?
DN: A Kawai harpsichord costs about 2 million yen.
CU: That's similar to the cost of a grand piano, isn't it?
DN: Yes, imported ones can be even more expensive.
CU: Keep practicing your music; you're doing great!
DN: Thank you. Good luck with your piano practice too!",57,15,15,15,15
6,"CU: Good evening!
DN: Good evening. How can I assist you tonight?
CU: Have you decided on tonight's dinner?
DN: We will eat out tonight.
CU: That sounds great! Will it be just the two of you?
DN: No, my college-aged son is home for the holidays, so the three of us will go out together.
CU: I see! Do you know what type of restaurant you'll go to?
DN: I haven't decided yet, but it will likely be either shabu-shabu or yakiniku.
CU: Nice! Young people do enjoy meat.
DN: Yes, indeed. I have some options in mind, but I want my son to decide.
CU: Understood. Are you happy when your son comes home?
DN: Yes, because there's no need to worry when he's nearby.
CU: I understand. They say that no matter how old a son gets, he always remains a concern for his mother.
DN: Are your children living with you?
CU: They are still in junior high school, so we are together. But thinking about the future when they leave makes me feel sad.
DN: That's right. I used to be a strong mother, and now I am learning to be a bit less so.
CU: You must have been very strong! Were your sons very obedient?
DN: That was part of the problem. Seeing a weaker mother makes them feel they need to be strong.
CU: I see. I'm also quite responsible, which might not always be good.
DN: Mothers are often more reliable than their sons, aren't they?
CU: Yes, they think they have to raise strong children. But it seems to have the opposite effect sometimes.
DN: It does. A teacher at a boys' school told the boys to value their pride.
CU: My mother-in-law says the same! She believes boys have a lot of pride.
DN: Yes. While I think real-life skills are more important, it seems pride matters a lot to boys.
CU: I see. It's difficult, isn't it? Boys and girls are quite different.
DN: Yes, very different. I need to show some weakness too.
CU: I understand. Since my child has been reliable lately, I will try to depend on him a little.
DN: Yes. But being too weak can be overwhelming for the other party, so it's better to be just a bit weak.
CU: Balancing it is difficult, isn't it? It's a daily process of trial and error!
DN: Yes. I will keep trying my best!",1,15,15,15,15

BH: Yes, it was. Did you take any measures to stay cool?
CU: Yes, for an outdoor music festival last week.
BH: What preparations did you make?
CU: Have you heard about the cooling gel NASA developed? It freezes at 28 degrees.
BH: I don't have information on that. Please explain.
CU: It turns into a cooling gel and forms a ring for your neck.
BH: Did it work well for you?
CU: Yes, it lasted about an hour and a half. Very effective.
BH: Have you tried cooling towels from the 100 yen shop?
CU: They are common, but don’t they make your clothes wet?
BH: Yes, some users report that.
CU: It depends on wrapping. Did you go somewhere with your son recently?
BH: Yes, we went out for a hospital visit.
CU: You get drenched in sweat just stepping outside, right?
BH: Yes, I just returned from shopping and had to change clothes.
CU: Daily laundry can be tough.
BH: Yes, especially when it suddenly rains while the laundry is out.
CU: We have a drum-type machine that dries as well.
BH: I use one too, but some clothes can't be dried in it.
CU: True, things that wrinkle can’t be dried.
BH: Correct. I avoid drying printed clothes to prevent damage.
CU: Yes, printed clothes do stick together.
BH: I switched to a drum-type dryer last year, which has helped.
CU: It really helps when you’re in a hurry.
BH: Yes, but the fluffiness of towels can’t be restored.",8,15,15,15,15

CU: I use chijimi flour too. The tteokbokki is from a kit.
BH: Is it easy to make?
CU: Yes, very easy. But it might be too spicy for kids.
BH: My daughter loves spicy food. She should be fine.
CU: That's great! You should try it. It’s really worth it.
BH: Is it available in regular supermarkets?
CU: Yes, I believe so. They should have it.
BH: I'll look for it today.
CU: Samgyeopsal is also easy and popular with kids.
BH: Is it just grilling pork?
CU: Yes, and making samjang, a sweet and spicy miso. You can easily make it at home.
BH: Is samjang sold in stores?
CU: Yes, but you can make it at home with gochujang and other seasonings.
BH: I see. I’ll check that out.
CU: Wrap the meat with seasoned bean sprouts, shredded green onions, and kimchi in lettuce or perilla leaves. It’s really tasty.
BH: That sounds good. I might have Korean food tonight.
CU: I recommend it, especially if you’re in the mood for something delicious.
BH: My son doesn't handle spicy food well.
CU: You can prepare two types of ssamjang, one without gochujang. That way, everyone can enjoy it.

CU: Akaso-kun is really cool. I've been interested in him too.
BH: I started liking him from another drama. I watch whenever he appears.
CU: Me too. What drama was it for you?
BH: Cherry Magic. It's a BL drama.
CU: I haven't seen it.
BH: He co-starred with Keita Machida. Both were cool.
CU: That's notable. Mr. Machida is in the Self-Defense Forces now.
BH: Yes, the drama's content is average, but enjoyable.
CU: The content is a bit like a sports club.
BH: It might be fan service for women.
CU: I'll take a look.
BH: Watching with family, I kept it moderate.
CU: That makes sense. Taking breaks by watching dramas is necessary.
