FO: Good evening.  
GQ: Are you working or studying?  
FO: I'm a student. It can be quite uncertain.  
GQ: Is it the credits causing the uncertainty?  
FO: Yes, that's part of it. I also struggle with getting up in the morning.  
GQ: Oh, I see. Being awake now must make it harder.  
FO: My sleep schedule is completely reversed.  
GQ: What do you usually do when you can't sleep at night?  
FO: Last night, I just couldn't sleep.  
GQ: My middle schooler often looks at their smartphone when they can't sleep. Do you do that too?  
FO: Sometimes, yes. I look at my smartphone because I can't sleep.  
GQ: I've read that blue light can keep you awake. Have you tried reducing screen time before bed?  
FO: I take sleeping pills, but they make me drowsy during the day, so I'm careful about it.  
GQ: That sounds tough to balance. I hope the pills are helping somewhat.  
FO: My symptoms aren't too severe, but I got something to help fix my sleep rhythm.  
GQ: Have you thought about exercising during the day? It might help reset your schedule.  
FO: I'd prefer to change the subject.  
GQ: Sure, no problem. Sorry if I pushed too much.  
FO: No worries.  
GQ: Do you watch movies?  
FO: Not that often. The last one was Eva.  
GQ: Was it recent?  
FO: Yes, it was.  
GQ: Was it the final chapter? How did you like it?  
FO: It was okay.  
GQ: I only know Evangelion from the TV anime.  
FO: I only know the new theatrical version.  
GQ: Looks like we're from different Evangelion eras, huh?  
FO: Seems that way.",10,15,15,15,15
