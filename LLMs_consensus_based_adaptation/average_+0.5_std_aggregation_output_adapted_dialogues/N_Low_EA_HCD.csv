EA: Mysteries are really intriguing! I'm not very familiar with them, though.
CP: Have you read any mystery authors?
EA: A friend once suggested ""Everything Becomes F.""
CP: That's by Mr. Mori. It's very popular.
EA: Really? I didn't know it was so well-known.
CP: Yes, it's quite popular.
EA: Is Mr. Mori writing anything else?
CP: Yes, he has written the Sky Crawlers series, which is also interesting.
