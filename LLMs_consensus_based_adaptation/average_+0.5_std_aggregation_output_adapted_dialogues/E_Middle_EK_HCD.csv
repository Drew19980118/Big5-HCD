EK: That makes sense. Does talking about the art with someone help?
BT: Yes, sharing your thoughts can offer new insights.
EK: Do you also create art yourself?
BT: I do some digital design work.
EK: That must require a lot of skill.
BT: Thank you. It's rewarding.
EK: Is digital design the main medium now?
