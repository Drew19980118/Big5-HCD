BL: Hello. Nice to meet you too.  
CC: Have you done anything summery?  
BL: Played with water in the bath.  
CC: Do you have kids?  
BL: Yes, I put her in a swimsuit to cheer her up.  
CC: Couldn't go to the sea or pool?  
BL: Might go this year, but the pool seems intimidating.  
CC: Because of COVID-19?  
BL: Yes, haven't been to a pool since COVID-19.  
CC: Makes sense. It can feel intimidating.  
BL: Best to start young. I can't swim either.  
CC: I wasn't great at swimming either. Walking on the beach made me miss it.  
BL: Swimming in the sea is impressive.  
CC: Not sure I could swim now though.  
BL: If you could before, you probably can now.  
CC: I wouldn't worry too much. Haven't swum since becoming an adult.  
BL: You might just enjoy the beach instead.  
CC: True. Haven't ridden a bike in 10 years either.  
BL: 10 years! It was fine when I rode again after a few years.  
CC: Riding on the road makes me anxious.  
BL: It can be pretty scary with so much traffic.  
CC: Feel uneasy seeing bikes on the road or sidewalk.  
BL: Separated sidewalks could make it safer.  
CC: Yes, that would be great.  
BL: More separated sidewalks would definitely help.  
CC: At Kawasaki Station, the number of bike sections was impressive.  
BL: Some places are more advanced in this area. Have you noticed similar setups elsewhere?  
CC: Yes, it's encouraging to see.  
BL: Hope more places improve like that.",16,15,15,15,15

BL: Primarily Twitter.
CC: I occasionally look at Twitter as well.
BL: I often see recommended tweets.
CC: Isn't Twitter's recommendation feature quite frequent?

BL: That's correct. Many are complaints.
CC: I check Twitter occasionally, so updates pile up.
BL: Many users update frequently.
CC: I spend more time on Instagram. Do you use it?
BL: Rarely. I have to log in each time.
CC: I recently installed TikTok.
BL: It features a lot of dancing content.
CC: The vibe seems different from what I'm used to.
BL: It may not suit everyone.
CC: I like dancing and thought it might be interesting.
BL: Have you danced before?
CC: A little, during school.
BL: Dance styles evolve over time.
CC: Chocopla on TikTok seems innovative.
BL: Is Chocopla famous?
CC: They're comedians from Chocolate Planet.
BL: It might be interesting to see non-dance content.
CC: In a sea of unclear posts, Chocopla stands out.
BL: It appears engaging.

BR: Thank you in advance.
CC: Do you enjoy exercising?
BR: Recently, I've just been walking and doing sit-ups.
CC: Do you walk often?
BR: Yes, over an hour a day before it got hot.
CC: Is walking for less than an hour less effective?
BR: Benefits start after about 20 minutes.
CC: Do you have any preferred exercises?
BR: No, but walking by the river near my house seems nice.
CC: Is the river close by?

5,"CC: Good evening!
CH: Good evening.
CC: Did you go out today?
CH: Yes, I went for a walk after dinner.
CC: Do you walk often?
CH: Yes, I walk daily if it doesn't rain. It has rained a lot recently.
CC: The rain finally stopped, right?
CH: Yes, and it's cooler in the mornings and evenings.
CC: It was cool this morning too.
CH: Yes, but it heats up quickly. It was hot in the early mornings recently.
CC: How long do you walk?
CH: About an hour.
CC: That's impressive. Why do you walk?
CH: I used to exercise a lot. Walking became my motivation after an illness.
CC: You must have been strong.
CH: Yes, I was energetic. I would run until 1 AM if I got home at midnight.
CC: From midnight! What time did you start work?
CH: I arrived at work around 8:30 AM. I didn't stay late often.
CC: Work alone exhausts me.
CH: Being young helped, but things can change with a trigger.
CC: With that much activity, you must sleep well.
CH: Yes. But before I got sick, I had sleep paralysis often.
CC: Really? What causes sleep paralysis?
CH: Often stress and overwork.
CC: That sounds like overworking.
CH: Yes, looking back, it was a sign of overdoing it.
CC: Things make more sense in hindsight.
CH: I want to be careful in the future for better sleep.
CC: Absolutely!
CH: Thank you.",5,15,15,15,15
6,"CC: Good evening! CH: Good evening. Nice to meet you. CC: Are you not sleepy yet at this time of day? CH: Sleepiness varies. I usually start to feel sleepy around this time. CC: Do you usually go to bed around midnight? CH: Typically around midnight. How about you? CC: I go to bed a little later, around 1 or 2 o'clock. CH: Don't you feel sleepy the next morning if it's around 2 o'clock? CC: I'm not working right now, so it's fine. When I am working, I aim to be asleep by 1 o'clock. CH: Understood. Sleep patterns vary widely among individuals. CC: Being a morning person or a night person might be influenced by genetics. CH: Some people have genes that make them better at night. CC: Matsuko Deluxe said, ""I'm completely a night owl."" CH: That's understandable. CC: If you were a morning person, I'd be surprised. CH: Some people need shorter sleep durations, while others need longer sleep. CC: About seven hours is just right for me. How about you? CH: I should sleep for 8 hours, but it doesn't always happen. CC: Sleeping for 10 hours is too much, right? CH: As an adult, 10 hours aren't typically necessary. CC: If I sleep for 10 hours, I can't wake up anymore. CH: I slept a lot in the countryside as a child. CC: Do you sleep a lot in the countryside? CH: It depends on the person, but that's generally the trend. CC: I see. I didn't really have that kind of image. CH: There were also those times, but we didn't have ways to play after dark. CC: I see! Don't you go to friends' houses either? CH: Children went home at 5 o'clock. CC: That was quick. But it's true, rural nights are really dark. CH: It was healthy for children in their growth period.",1,15,15,15,15
