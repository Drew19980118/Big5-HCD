BL: Hello. Nice to meet you too.  
CC: Have you done anything summery?  
BL: Played with water in the bath.  
CC: Do you have kids?  
BL: Yes, I put her in a swimsuit to cheer her up.  
CC: Couldn't go to the sea or pool?  
BL: Might go this year, but the pool seems intimidating.  
CC: Because of COVID-19?  
BL: Yes, haven't been to a pool since COVID-19.  
CC: Makes sense. It can feel intimidating.  
BL: Best to start young. I can't swim either.  
CC: I wasn't great at swimming either. Walking on the beach made me miss it.  
BL: Swimming in the sea is impressive.  
CC: Not sure I could swim now though.  
BL: If you could before, you probably can now.  
CC: I wouldn't worry too much. Haven't swum since becoming an adult.  
BL: You might just enjoy the beach instead.  
CC: True. Haven't ridden a bike in 10 years either.  
BL: 10 years! It was fine when I rode again after a few years.  
CC: Riding on the road makes me anxious.  
BL: It can be pretty scary with so much traffic.  
CC: Feel uneasy seeing bikes on the road or sidewalk.  
BL: Separated sidewalks could make it safer.  
CC: Yes, that would be great.  
BL: More separated sidewalks would definitely help.  
CC: At Kawasaki Station, the number of bike sections was impressive.  
BL: Some places are more advanced in this area. Have you noticed similar setups elsewhere?  
CC: Yes, it's encouraging to see.  
BL: Hope more places improve like that.",16,15,15,15,15
