3,"BE: Hello.  
AQ: Hello.  
BE: What is your favorite drink?  
AQ: It’s milk.  
BE: Interesting choice!  
AQ: It's like a child, isn't it?  
BE: It seems healthy.  
AQ: I don't drink coffee or sweet juice.  
BE: Do you also drink milk outside?  
AQ: No, but I might if I visit a hot spring.  
BE: Milk is often associated with hot springs. I wonder why.  
AQ: I'm not sure why, but the bottled kind is good.  
BE: The one in the bottle! It tastes good, doesn't it?  
AQ: Oh yes, why does that taste so good?  
BE: I don't like milk, so if I have to drink it, I prefer fruit milk.

AQ: Certainly! It's very sweet.  
BE: Do they add a lot of sugar?

BE: In a good way, I think.  
AQ: Yes.  
BE: I drink it almost every day.  
AQ: That's right! I've heard it helps you relax.  
BE: Since it's ground from beans, it has a nice aroma.  
AQ: Yeah, I might like the scent.  
BE: See you next time!  
AQ: Again!",2,15,15,15,15

AQ: Hello
BE: Do you drink alcohol?
AQ: No, I don't. Do you?

AF: Hello.
BE: Do you have any pets?
AF: Yes, I keep fish and insects.
BE: Fish and insects? Interesting.
AF: Yes, two tanks for tropical fish and goldfish.
BE: Is managing them difficult?

BE: Do you have larger fish now?
AF: I used to have piranhas, but now just small tropical fish.
BE: Piranhas? Wow!
AF: Yes, it was a dream to keep them.
BE: What do piranhas eat?
AF: Bloodworms and carnivorous pellets.
BE: I thought they ate live organisms.
AF: They eat raw fish. Excess guppies became food.
BE: Using guppies as food? Surprising.
AF: Usually, people buy small fish for feeding.
BE: Preparing bait sounds like a hassle.
AF: Feeding raw fish might help them grow larger.
BE: Do you want to make them larger?
