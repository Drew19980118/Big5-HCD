AQ: Hello.
BE: I got a new printer last week.
AQ: Did you have one before?

AQ: Printers are quite handy.
BE: I love printing photos with it.
AQ: Are you planning to print many photos?

AQ: Is it genuine ink?
BE: Can I use non-genuine ink?

3,"BE: Hello.  
AQ: Hello.  
BE: What is your favorite drink?  
AQ: It’s milk.  
BE: Interesting choice!  
AQ: It's like a child, isn't it?  
BE: It seems healthy.  
AQ: I don't drink coffee or sweet juice.  
BE: Do you also drink milk outside?  
AQ: No, but I might if I visit a hot spring.  
BE: Milk is often associated with hot springs. I wonder why.  
AQ: I'm not sure why, but the bottled kind is good.  
BE: The one in the bottle! It tastes good, doesn't it?  
AQ: Oh yes, why does that taste so good?  
BE: I don't like milk, so if I have to drink it, I prefer fruit milk.  
AQ: Ah, yes! The sweet one.  
BE: It's so sweet that it burns my throat.  
AQ: Certainly! It's very sweet.  
BE: Do they add a lot of sugar?  
AQ: Hahaha. What do you usually drink?  
BE: Coffee or tea. I don't drink juice.  
AQ: Doesn't coffee make you addicted?  
BE: In a good way, I think.  
AQ: Yes.  
BE: I drink it almost every day.  
AQ: That's right! I've heard it helps you relax.  
BE: Since it's ground from beans, it has a nice aroma.  
AQ: Yeah, I might like the scent.  
BE: See you next time!  
AQ: Again!",2,15,15,15,15
4,"BE: Hello
AQ: Hello
BE: Do you drink alcohol?
AQ: No, I don't. Do you?
BE: I occasionally drink, so I bought a SodaStream.
AQ: Understood. How do you use it?
BE: It's more convenient than buying sparkling water each time.
AQ: Do you mix it with alcohol?
BE: Yes.
AQ: Interesting. Any specific type?
BE: Recently, I mix it with fruit vinegar.
AQ: What type?
BE: Fruity flavors like micho.

AF: Hello.
BE: Do you have any pets?
AF: Yes, I keep fish and insects.
BE: Fish and insects? Interesting.
AF: Yes, two tanks for tropical fish and goldfish.
BE: Is managing them difficult?
AF: My husband handles the tank cleaning.
BE: Water quality management must need attention. We used to keep fish too.
AF: What kind of fish did you have?
BE: Tropical fish, likely guppies.
AF: Small ones. They are cute.
BE: Do you have larger fish now?
AF: I used to have piranhas, but now just small tropical fish.
BE: Piranhas? Wow!
AF: Yes, it was a dream to keep them.
BE: What do piranhas eat?
AF: Bloodworms and carnivorous pellets.
BE: I thought they ate live organisms.
AF: They eat raw fish. Excess guppies became food.
BE: Using guppies as food? Surprising.
AF: Usually, people buy small fish for feeding.
BE: Preparing bait sounds like a hassle.
AF: Feeding raw fish might help them grow larger.
BE: Do you want to make them larger?
AF: Yes, seeing them grow is satisfying.
BE: Must be satisfying to watch them grow.
AF: It was sad when a big one died.
BE: That must have been hard.

EJ: Hi.
BE: Favorite drink?
EJ: Ginger ale.
BE: I like ginger ale too!
EJ: Had a spicy one at a burger shop.
BE: Very spicy?
EJ: Yes, with ginger paste.
BE: Had something similar at a pancake shop.
EJ: Those places also have craft cola.
BE: Many luxurious drinks.
EJ: Unique drinks not in regular stores.
BE: That ginger ale was too spicy for me.
EJ: Do you handle spicy food well?
BE: Not really, but I like wasabi.
EJ: Wasabi is okay?
BE: Can't handle painful chili peppers.
EJ: Understandable.
BE: Worse when it's hot, right?
EJ: Heat increases spiciness. Prefer medium curry.
BE: Me too, medium spicy is best.
EJ: Medium spicy is delicious.
BE: If it’s sweet, it feels lacking.
EJ: Very spicy dishes focus on spiciness.
BE: Some foods focus too much on spice.
EJ: Many dishes marketed for extreme spiciness.
BE: I don’t get why spicy food is so popular.
EJ: Some enjoy the challenge but prefer moderate spice.
BE: Hope it doesn't cause a stomachache.
EJ: Spiciness can cause discomfort.",13,15,15,15,15
9,"BE: Hello!
AQ: Hello!
BE: Have you been surprised by anything lately?
AQ: I was surprised when the artist I wanted to see as a guest appeared at the festival I went to over the weekend.
BE: Was it a surprise appearance?
AQ: Yes, it was a surprise. Have you ever been surprised in reverse?
BE: Yes, one thing comes to mind.
AQ: What is it?
BE: It was not common nationwide for an egg to be placed under the Napolitan.
AQ: This is the first time I've heard of an egg under the Napolitan.
BE: Really? Is it laid out?
AQ: I didn't know that. Is it only in that area?
BE: It seems so. Even though it's delicious.
AQ: I see. I thought Napolitan was just pasta.
BE: It's served on a hot iron plate. I thought it was a staple of coffee shops.
AQ: I see. This is the first time I've heard that.
BE: Recently, there have only been such trivial surprises.
AQ: Regional variations can be interesting.
BE: Sometimes we use dialects without realizing it!
AQ: Yes. Since I'm in Tokyo, I sometimes wonder about the meanings of other dialects.
BE: Are you also from Tokyo?
AQ: Yes, I am from Tokyo.
BE: Then it's a standard dialect!
AQ: There are times when I can't understand other dialects.
BE: It's troubling when you don't understand anything at all, isn't it?
AQ: There are many unique dialects, and those are interesting.
BE: My region is known for having a less common dialect, so I find others fascinating.
AQ: Dialects can spread over time.
BE: If it's something strong like the Kansai dialect, it gets picked up.
AQ: Right. Sometimes it gets transferred in unexpected ways.",2,15,15,15,15
