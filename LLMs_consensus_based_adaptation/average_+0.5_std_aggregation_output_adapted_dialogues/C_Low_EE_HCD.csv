EV: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
EE: Do you have any favorite foods?
EV: You like chicken, don't you? I'm not really a picky eater.
EE: Chicken! You can prepare it in many different ways, right?
EV: That's right. It's healthy, and you can consume a variety of dishes with it.
EE: Do you have any favorite dishes in particular?
EV: Is it karaage or chicken nanban, I wonder? Using thigh meat.
EE: Thigh meat is juicy and delicious, isn't it?

EE: I'm hungry.
EV: Have you had dinner yet?
EE: I haven't returned home yet, so it is likely to be around midnight.
EV: Understood. Having a late dinner is not very good for you.
EE: That's right. So there are often days when I don't eat dinner.
EV: I see. I often skip breakfast and lunch, but I try to have dinner.
EE: I often skip breakfast, so there are many days when I only have one meal a day.
EV: I occasionally have only dinner on weekdays.
EE: When you're busy, it ends up like that, doesn't it?
EV: Yes, it's quite difficult to find a substantial amount of time.

EE: That sounds fun! I have lots of memories from playing badminton.  
EV: I played in the badminton club in high school too.  
EE: Badminton is a lot of fun, isn't it?  
EV: Yes, and it's convenient since it can be played indoors.

EV: Yes, doubles matches were very common.  
EE: Did you play singles as well?  
EV: Mostly for in-house matches, but doubles were more common in tournaments.  
EE: That makes sense. Doubles are less physically demanding in terms of coverage.  
EV: Yes, the smaller defensive area makes it easier to manage.  
EE: But coordinating with a partner can be challenging.  
EV: Definitely. It took some time to get used to the coordination.  
EE: It's great when you find a consistent partner, though.  
EV: Playing with different partners could be more challenging.  
EE: Did you enjoy doubles more than singles?  
EV: Yes, I enjoyed the teamwork aspect of doubles.  
EE: The best part is when you can effectively support your teammate.  
EV: I agree, it feels great to work well together.",29,15,15,15,15
