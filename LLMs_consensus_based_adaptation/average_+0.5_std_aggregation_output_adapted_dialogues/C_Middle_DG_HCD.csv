DV: Yuzu's concerts don’t seem to have screaming fans.
DG: They're skillful but very energetic!
DV: Are all live performances like that?
DG: I'd prefer something where I can sit and listen calmly.
DV: Same here, a performance where we can sit and enjoy would be nice.
DG: I don't like the pressure of standing up. Participation should be voluntary!
DV: It's hard to sit when everyone else is standing.
DG: Even if I'm enjoying it, that pressure is real.
DV: DVDs are a more relaxed option.
DG: Perfect for these times.
DV: Agreed.",16,15,15,15,15
