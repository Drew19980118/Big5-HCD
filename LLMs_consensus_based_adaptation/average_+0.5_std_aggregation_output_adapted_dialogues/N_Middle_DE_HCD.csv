1,"DE: Hello. Nice to meet you.  
CR: Hello. How can I assist you today?  
DE: What are your hobbies?  
CR: I enjoy being active, mainly at the gym.  
DE: Is it some kind of sport? Or is it training or something?  
CR: Yes, it's a bit of training at the gym.  
DE: That's cool. I also went to the gym, but I couldn't continue.  
CR: Having a goal can help maintain consistency.  
DE: I see. I usually just walk my dog.  
CR: Walking the dog sounds enjoyable and relaxing.  
DE: The heat was so intense in the summer that I hesitated to go for a walk, but walking together is enjoyable.  
CR: Weather conditions can definitely impact outdoor activities.  
DE: Yes, yes. The gym is not affected by the heat or cold, right?  
CR: Correct, the gym environment is good all year round.  
DE: Do you also use things like running machines?  
CR: Yes, I run on the machine for 30 minutes.  
DE: That's healthy. I used a machine with adjustable incline at the gym I used to go to.  
CR: Inclines can make the exercise more challenging and effective.  
DE: When there is an incline, it puts quite a load on you. It felt like mountain climbing.  
CR: Walking at an incline can be very tough but rewarding.  
DE: How many hours a day do you train?  
CR: I train twice a week for about 2 hours each time.  
DE: That sounds like a moderate and sustainable routine.  
CR: It's important to keep it manageable to avoid burnout.  
DE: I see. And then I retired. Haha.  
CR: It's great that you found a balance that works for you.  
DE: During the time when I was often at home because of the pandemic, I was doing Zumba indoors.  
CR: Did you follow YouTube videos for that?  
DE: Yes. It seems like I can keep going if there's music.  
CR: Music can definitely make workouts more enjoyable.",3,15,15,15,15
2,"DE: Hello.
CR: Hello.
DE: Any plans for the fall?
CR: Considering a trip.
DE: What about the COVID-19 situation?
CR: Hoping it stabilizes soon.
DE: Have any destinations in mind?
CR: Thinking about Noto.
DE: Noto or Toyama, perhaps?
CR: Haven't visited either.
DE: The seafood there, like sweet shrimp and yellowtail, is excellent.
CR: Sounds appealing.
DE: Fish from the Sea of Japan are quite tasty, aren't they?
CR: Yes, and there's a lot of variety.
DE: Will you take the Shinkansen or a plane?
CR: Both are options.
DE: Planes are faster, but the Shinkansen could be a pleasant experience.
CR: I haven't tried the Shinkansen before.
DE: It might depend on the airport location.
CR: True, it varies.
DE: Renting a car could give you more flexibility.
CR: It's convenient from the airport.
DE: You can explore various places that way.
CR: Even smaller spots have interesting sights.
DE: Planning to visit Kanazawa too?
CR: If staying for two nights, yes.
DE: The castle town and Kenrokuen are beautiful.
CR: I've been to Kanazawa before, though.
DE: There are many other fantastic spots to explore as well.
CR: Hoping for better conditions by then.",32,15,15,15,15
3,"DE: Hello. Please.  
CR: Hello.  
DE: Do you listen to music?  
CR: I just listen to the songs playing on FM.  
DE: Got it. J-WAVE is playing here too.  
CR: I listen to it on Radiko on my smartphone during my commute.  
DE: That makes sense. Radiko is great because you can listen to it later even if you miss it.  
CR: It's clearer than the radio waves.  
DE: It used to be noisy in the past.  
CR: Speaking of which, I was watching TikTok recently and thought that EDM is pretty cool.  
DE: What is EDM? I'm not familiar with it.  
CR: It stands for electronic dance music.  
DE: Oh, is it a video of people dancing to the music?  
CR: EDM is typically played in clubs and at live shows.  
DE: So it's about enjoying clubs and live performances through videos?  
CR: More like going to the club and dancing while listening to it.  
DE: Due to COVID-19, it's quite difficult to go to clubs and live houses, isn't it?  
CR: Yes, indeed. I would like to go there someday and see how it feels to move my body.  
DE: Before COVID, I used to go quite often. It's incredibly fun to move my body to the music.  
CR: I have only been to a club once, and it was boring that time.  
DE: It sounds like it didn't meet your expectations. What kind of genres do you like?  
CR: Definitely not enka, haha. The last concert I went to was Lady Gaga's.  
DE: Oh, speaking of Lady Gaga, it's Top Gun. Have you watched it?  
CR: I watched it!  
DE: I watched it too! Twice!  
CR: Twice!! I ended up crying at the end.  
DE: Already, from the first intro, goosebumps.  
CR: That was cool, it was intense.  
DE: It was truly a movie full of entertainment.  
CR: Absolutely!",2,15,15,15,15
4,"DE: Hello  
CR: Hello.  
DE: Do you drink coffee?  
CR: Yes, with sugar and milk.  
DE: I prefer black coffee.  
CR: What kind?  
DE: Ethiopian.  
CR: I don't like black coffee.  
DE: I used to dislike it but grew to like it after starting work.  
CR: I never liked black coffee.  
DE: I enjoy coffee but prefer decaf due to caffeine sensitivity.  
CR: Does coffee keep you awake?  
DE: It helps at work.  
CR: I drink it too, but it just affects my mood.  
DE: Caffeine affects people differently.  
CR: Yes, it might be individual constitution.  
DE: Yes. Thick matcha in tea ceremonies was intense.  
CR: I'm thinking of learning the tea ceremony.  
DE: It's profound.  
CR: Should I try a one-day course?  
DE: Yes, and check the atmosphere first.  
CR: What kind of atmosphere is good?  
DE: One to enjoy wabi-sabi without illness discussions.  
CR: Do such topics come up?  
DE: In my previous classroom, no. But after moving, the atmosphere changed.  
CR: Is that why you quit?  
DE: Yes, it was too different.  
CR: I hope you find a good place.  
DE: Thanks. I hope you find a good classroom too.  
CR: A classroom with delicious snacks would be nice.",16,15,15,15,15
5,"DE: Good evening!  
BG: Good evening! What kind of hobbies do you have?  
DE: I've tried various things, but recently I've become interested in DIY.  
BG: DIY is a great hobby. There are many parts available, and it's fun to choose them.  
DE: Yes, it's true. It's also enjoyable to plan the process. What are your hobbies?  
BG: I engage in different activities—writing essays, walking, photography, playing the piano, and listening to Fujii Kaze.  
DE: Essays! That's impressive.  
BG: It's like an extended diary. You write about your thoughts.  
DE: I see. It helps organize your thoughts.  
BG: Thinking of it as writing when you want to makes it easier than keeping a daily diary.  
DE: I also think about doing it every day, but I can't always keep up. If it's okay to do it occasionally, I'd like to try it too.  
BG: Yes, give it a try. You can look back at it later, and it's interesting.  
DE: It is nice to read it again. Sometimes when I reread my old blog posts, I feel glad that I wrote them.  
BG: Blogging is great. I used to blog too, but now I focus on handwriting.  
DE: Do you have any favorite stationery?  
BG: I like various writing instruments, especially ballpoint pens.  
DE: I have a favorite stationery store nearby and ended up buying a fountain pen I won't use.  
BG: Fountain pens are cool, but I mostly use ballpoint pens now.  
DE: What size do you prefer? Thin or thick?  
BG: 0.5 is ideal. The Uni Jetstream is excellent.  
DE: I'll check it out next time! You prefer thin pens.  
BG: Yes, I also write thank-you letters, and it's easier with a thin pen.  
DE: You seem good at writing.  
BG: It's just ordinary writing. I also like doodling with colored brush pens.  
DE: Since you do it for work, you must be good at it. I gave up on penmanship courses.  
BG: Those courses are often too short. They need to be longer.  
DE: I practice common characters, but it's hard to stay motivated with less common ones.  
BG: You have to practice various characters and sentences, which is challenging.  
DE: Enjoying the writing process would be best.  
BG: Understood.",2,15,15,15,15

DE: My family got me into it.
BF: Are there any mountains that left a strong impression on you?

BF: Was it due to weather conditions?
DE: Yes, it was during winter, possibly spring or autumn.
BF: Climbing must require physical strength.

7,"DE: Hello! BF: Hello, nice to meet you. DE: Have you already decided what to have for dinner tonight? BF: I haven't decided yet. How about you? DE: I'm not sure either, just wondering what’s in the fridge. BF: It's tough to come up with a menu daily, isn’t it? DE: Totally! Do you shop every day? BF: No, I do bulk shopping on weekends. DE: Me too. When the fridge gets low, I often make stir-fries. BF: I understand. There's usually not much left in the fridge on Fridays. DE: True. Online recipe searches with certain ingredients often end up being stir-fries. BF: I get it. Maybe I'll just buy something today because it’s convenient. DE: How far is your local supermarket? BF: There are 4-5 shops within a 10-minute walk. DE: Nice! You have many choices. BF: Yes, and there’s a delicious yakitori restaurant nearby. DE: Wow, lucky you! BF: I’m thinking of getting yakitori there today. DE: Takeout, right? It’s nice those options have increased. BF: Yes, it’s been enjoyable. DE: It's great to experience the taste without entering the store. BF: Sometimes it’s intimidating to go inside, right? DE: Yes! More convenient for lunch too. BF: Indeed. I’m getting hungry. DE: Same here. I love the local supermarket's original takoyaki. BF: Sounds delicious! DE: The broth is really flavorful, and it’s so chewy! BF: My stomach just growled! DE: Haha. I hope your dinner is delicious! BF: Thanks! Let’s chat again.",1,15,15,15,15
