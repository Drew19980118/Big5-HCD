1,"CF: Good evening!
BW: Good evening, it has been hot every day. How are you feeling?
CF: Thank you for your concern! I’m alright, except for some cavities.
BW: I have a cavity too, I need to go soon.
CF: I don’t like dentists much, but I started going at the end of June because the pain got really bad.
BW: I dislike it too. I go when it becomes really unavoidable, but I tend to stay away.
CF: Going for regular check-ups after cavity treatment is also bothersome.
BW: Recently, it takes a long time for dentists to complete everything, and check-ups are also tough, aren't they?
CF: I see. I had quite a few cavities, so it looks like I'll have to go to the dentist for a long time, which I don't like.
BW: I went for treatment two years ago, but I stopped going after the part I was concerned about was fixed.
CF: I understand! I did that about three years ago too.
BW: Even if it gets better after going, it soon gets worse again; I really want to find a dentist that suits me.
CF: That's right. There are so many dentists nowadays, it's hard to know which one is good.
BW: There are many options, but you won’t know until you try one yourself.
CF: There can be differences between reviews and the actual experience.
BW: I see, even if it's popular, there have been times when it didn't suit me.
CF: I understand! That’s how the last dentist was for me.
BW: It's difficult, isn't it? After fixing it, food gets stuck in your teeth even more, and it's troublesome.
CF: That's troubling! I feel like complaining.
BW: My friend also said it was tough because of the sensitivity from correcting the gap in their front teeth.
CF: Braces might cause sensitivity and make you irritable. They are expensive, aren’t they?
BW: That's right, and it seemed like they didn’t get much response even when they reported it.
CF: Dentists are generally expensive, so it’s disappointing when something needs extra attention.
BW: If it seems like it's not going well, I'd really like you to handle it properly.
CF: That's right! But in reality, I can't say it.
BW: My friend couldn't say it at the moment and communicated it quite a bit later.
CF: I see. Were they able to respond?
BW: It wasn’t possible, but they did it for an additional fee.
CF: An additional fee! That makes me feel uneasy. Thank you for the information!
BW: You're welcome! Thank you very much!",1
2,"CF: Good evening!
BW: Good evening. Do you exercise?
CF: No, not regularly.
BW: Same here.
CF: I tried water walking at the pool weekly.
BW: Is it effective?
CF: Yes, I walk in the 50m pool and sometimes swim.
BW: Can you still swim?
CF: I used to, but not anymore.
BW: Less crowded times might help.
CF: The pool is open until 9 PM and is less crowded in the evening.
BW: Some pools have separate areas for swimming and walking.
CF: That’s helpful.
BW: Keeping a routine is challenging.
CF: It takes determination.
BW: Without a goal, it’s hard. I stretch at home sometimes.
CF: That's good. I only stretch after long computer use.
BW: Long computer use causes stiffness.
CF: Yes, it affects blood flow.
BW: My shoulders and back get sore. I want to find time to exercise.
CF: It’s tough with a busy schedule.
BW: Yes, it often gets postponed.
CF: I understand.
BW: An app might help keep it consistent.
CF: Smartwatches and smartphones can help.
BW: They’re convenient. Use them.
CF: I manage my sleep with my smartphone.
BW: You can monitor sleep and heart rate now.
CF: It’s convenient. Thanks for the chat!
BW: You're welcome.",16
3,"CF: Good evening.
BW: Hello. What are you interested in lately?
CF: I've started casual cycling again.
BW: What's pottering?
CF: Cycling without a specific goal.
BW: Do you explore the city or nature?
CF: Mainly the city, inspired by YouTube videos.
BW: Understood.
CF: You can check out Shibuya pottering videos.
BW: I'll search for those.
CF: Any hobbies lately?
BW: Practicing the ukulele.
CF: How is your progress?
BW: I'm relearning it.
CF: What songs are you focusing on?
BW: Hawaiian and Western songs.
CF: Noted.
BW: Do you listen to music often?
CF: Yes, mainly Japanese music and game soundtracks.
BW: Which game soundtracks?
CF: Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger.
BW: Acknowledged.
CF: I still enjoy them a lot.
BW: Understood.
CF: The legacy of game music continues.
BW: It's significant in Japan.
CF: Agreed. Thanks for the chat.
BW: You’re welcome.",23
4,"CF: Good morning. It's sunny and refreshing this morning.
BQ: Good morning. It is raining here.
CF: Is it a typhoon?
BQ: That might also have an impact.
CF: Understood. It rained heavily here yesterday, so please stay safe.
BQ: Thank you. Recently, there has been a lot of heavy rain in various places, hasn't there?
CF: That's correct. Flooding in familiar areas is indeed frightening.
BQ: Have you ever experienced flood damage?
CF: A bridge over the nearby river once collapsed, but that's the extent of it. How about you?
BQ: My town is fine, but the neighboring town is particularly vulnerable to flooding.
CF: I see. Cleaning up after a flood is very challenging, isn't it?
BQ: Yes, I heard the smell can be strong.
CF: Especially in the summer, things spoil quickly.
BQ: Do you think insurance covers flood damage?
CF: I'm not sure. I hope it does, but it makes me anxious.
BQ: I heard that for a fire, insurance won't be paid out unless it's a total loss, which worries me.
CF: Really? That is troubling.
BQ: Are you doing anything for disaster prevention?
CF: I might not have done much, just preparing some stockpiles.
BQ: I haven't done anything specific either. We should prepare for stockpiling, right?
CF: It would be good. There are cookies that can be stored for five years.
BQ: There are ones that can be rehydrated with water. They seem to be quite delicious.
CF: I heard recent ones are very well-made and delicious. I would like to try them.
BQ: It's important to get used to the taste. Hopefully, we won't need to use them.
CF: That's true. Floods are scary, but earthquakes might be the scariest.
BQ: They say another big earthquake is coming. That's why we need to take measures.
CF: Every year, I think, ""This year will come!"" but my stockpile is still not enough.
BQ: There are also feelings of not wanting to think about disasters, aren't there?
CF: I tend to look away from reality. Thank you for the talk!
BQ: You're welcome.",1
5,"CF: Good morning.
BQ: Good morning. Any plans for Obon?
CF: We usually visit the grave, but not this year because of COVID-19.
BQ: Noted. I went yesterday since it’s nearby.
CF: Was it hot without any shade?
BQ: Yes, very hot.
CF: Your ancestors would be happy. Any other plans?
BQ: Planning to visit a nearby hot spring.
CF: Do you visit often?
BQ: I stay overnight once a year, but take day trips often.
CF: That sounds nice.
BQ: Do you like hot springs?
CF: Yes, I enjoy them. Used to visit super sento often.
BQ: Super sento is convenient.
CF: I agree. Now some places are like manga cafes.
BQ: I used to nap in theater rooms.
CF: That’s interesting.
BQ: Food is good there.
CF: Yes, snacks and beer too.
BQ: Good right after a bath.
CF: That sounds like me!
BQ: Some places offer overnight stays.
CF: Useful if you miss the last train.
BQ: I see.
CF: I would prefer super sento if I miss the train.
BQ: Manga cafes are cramped with only showers.
CF: Agreed. Best to go home.
BQ: Do you commute by train?
CF: No, I work from home.
BQ: Understood. Thank you.
CF: See you later!",4
6,"CF: Good morning. Are you an early riser?
BQ: Good morning. I usually get up at 7:30.
CF: I get up at 5 a.m. on weekdays.
BQ: That's early. Do you walk?
CF: No, I prepare for my family.
BQ: That sounds busy. Do you rest?
CF: I make bento lunches early.
BQ: Frozen foods can help save time.
CF: Do you use frozen foods? What's your favorite?
BQ: Grilled salted salmon.
CF: A classic choice.
BQ: It's still tasty cold. Favorite bento sides?
CF: Kinpira and shibazuke.
BQ: Sweet kinpira is nice.
CF: White sesame seeds make it better.
BQ: How many years making bento?
CF: 13 years.
BQ: That's a long time.
CF: Thanks. Still bad at tamagoyaki.
BQ: Sweet or savory tamagoyaki?
CF: I prefer salty, but I make it sweet for my family.
BQ: Tips for making it well?
CF: Wrapping it is tricky. Needs practice.
BQ: Best bento side dish?
CF: Hamburger steak and kinpira.
BQ: Good choices.
CF: I prepare them the day before.
BQ: Prepared meals are helpful.
CF: It saves time. Thanks for chatting.
BQ: Thank you.",14
7,"CF: Good morning. I’m thinking about getting something I want since payday is next week.  
BQ: Good morning. What do you want to buy?  
CF: A display that connects to a computer.  
BQ: There are many options available.  
CF: I want to connect it to my laptop and use two screens.  
BQ: A multi-display setup can improve work efficiency.  
CF: I also want to watch videos while working.  
BQ: Finding the right one can be difficult.  
CF: Yes, it's hard to choose with so many options.  
BQ: I also want a monitor arm.  
CF: That sounds interesting.  
BQ: I want to move it around easily, but they can be expensive.  
CF: That's quite a high price.  
BQ: High-end ones prevent eye strain.  
CF: I see.  
BQ: It's important to take care of our eyes during long computer usage.  
CF: Yes, I got blue light blocking glasses.  
BQ: How effective are they?  
CF: They're like lightly tinted sunglasses.  
BQ: Is there a noticeable difference when you wear them?  
CF: The brightness is different, definitely.  
BQ: Does it feel darker with the glasses?  
CF: Yes, compared to regular glasses, you can notice the difference.  
BQ: I might consider getting a pair.  
CF: The only drawback is they reflect blue light at certain angles.  
BQ: That could look cool.  
CF: Kids seem to think it's ""Wow!""  
BQ: It sounds like a neat effect.  
CF: It does look that way! Thanks for the chat!  
BQ: You're welcome.",3
8,"CF: Good morning. It's a bit cool this morning, isn't it?
BZ: Good morning. It is very humid.
CF: The weather might be getting worse.
BZ: I will visit the grave while the weather is still good.
CF: It's Obon, right?
BZ: Yes, it is. The sense of seasons is fading.
CF: It's hot in cemeteries because there's no shade.
BZ: You should go soon.
CF: Morning seems best. There's a typhoon here, so I'm staying home.
BZ: Did the Kanto region get hit today?
CF: It's sunny now, but I'm unsure what will happen.
BZ: Preparing for the typhoon might keep it away.
CF: It's strange. We are well-prepared this time.
BZ: The typhoon is moving towards unprepared areas.
CF: It might not come here. That's good but a bit frustrating.
BZ: If we relax, it will come!
CF: After we've eaten all our supplies, right? I understand.
BZ: Let's hope it doesn't get worse.
CF: Thank you. I wanted to go out to eat, so I'll watch the situation.
BZ: It is humid. The room temperature is 31 degrees.
CF: That's high. It feels more humid here.
BZ: There's a breeze outside. I'll cut bellflowers for the grave.
CF: Having bellflowers in the garden is nice.
BZ: I divided and replanted them, and now the garden is full of bellflowers.
CF: That's nice. It's hard to do on a condo balcony.
BZ: We live on the second and third floors. There's a flower bed on the first floor.
CF: I let my cherry tomato plant wither the other day.
BZ: That was unfortunate. Did you get any tomatoes?
CF: I was satisfied with what I got! I'll try again next time. Thank you for the conversation.
BZ: Thank you as well.",2
