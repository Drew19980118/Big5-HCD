1,"DM: Good evening.
BP: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
DM: Have you done any shopping recently?
BP: Yes, I recently bought a neck cooler. It's been very useful.
DM: What exactly is a neck cooler?
BP: It’s a device that you chill and wear around your neck to stay comfortable.
DM: Is it like a towel made from a special material?
BP: It’s made from a material used in space, and it has a coolant pack inside.
DM: That's fascinating. I'd love to try it.
BP: You can find one for about 1000 yen on Qoo10.
DM: That sounds affordable. Can it be used multiple times?
BP: Yes, it solidifies quickly in the refrigerator and is reusable.
DM: Does it warm up fast in hot environments?
BP: It stays cool for about 2 hours. For outdoor activities, a cooling towel or patch might be better.
DM: It might help lower electricity costs at home.
BP: Yes, it’s a good alternative to using the air conditioner for small tasks.
DM: I live alone, and my electricity bill has been high lately.
BP: Electricity prices have increased by about 1000 yen on average.
DM: Going out can be expensive too, right?
BP: Yes, but public places like libraries or shopping malls are good options.
DM: I went to a shopping mall today, and it was very crowded.
BP: And driving costs fuel. It’s easy to make unplanned purchases when you’re out.
DM: I often end up buying unnecessary items.
BP: That’s common for many people.
DM: I love reading and often buy books when I visit a bookstore.
BP: Libraries are a great way to borrow books instead of buying them.
DM: Libraries are convenient, but popular books are hard to borrow.
BP: You can reserve books, but it might take a while to get them.
DM: It feels like you want to read them right away.
BP: I understand. Thank you for the conversation today.",9

BP: Good evening.  
DM: Thank you in advance.  
BP: Did you have dinner?  
DM: Not yet, but I had a late lunch.  
BP: You must be hungry. Are you okay?  
DM: Yes, I'm holding up.  
BP: We received zucchini and made ratatouille.  
DM: Summer vegetables are wonderful!  
BP: They help with preventing fatigue and colds.  
DM: Seasonal vegetables taste great.  
BP: With a pressure cooker, ratatouille is quick.

DM: Got it. I made corn rice recently.  
BP: Do you use a rice cooker?  
DM: Yes, with fresh corn.  
BP: I'll try that next time.  
DM: Add the core for extra flavor!  
BP: I thought just the kernels were used.  
DM: The broth from the core enhances the taste.  
BP: I'll try it. Thanks for the tip!  
DM: What other summer vegetables are there?  
BP: Tomatoes, eggplants, okra, and bitter melons.  
DM: I love tomatoes! How do you have them?  
BP: Fresh, and in dishes like ratatouille.

BP: Informative?
DM: Yes, but I watch YouTube explanation videos too.
BP: Too many characters to follow?
DM: Correct. This one is about the Kamakura Shogunate and 13 retainers.
BP: YouTube is essential. Hard to keep up without notes.

BP: Hard to choose, but Kingdom 2 and Jurassic Park.
DM: Curious about Kingdom. Was it grand?
BP: Yes, great impact. A must-see in theaters.

CN: I woke up because it was garbage day.  
DM: It's the worst when you forget to take it out, right?  
CN: It was raining on the recyclable garbage day, so I couldn't put it out the night before.  
DM: You're responsible. Some people here just put out trash anytime.  
CN: I feel bad asking them to collect wet cardboard.  
DM: I also need to get rid of the accumulating cardboard.  
CN: Cardboard tends to accumulate.  
DM: I put it off until it accumulates, then tie it up and dispose of it.  
CN: It accumulates while you're doing that.  
DM: I like tying up cardboard boxes.  
CN: I can't put things together nicely.  
DM: It feels good to tie it well because it's difficult.

DM: It feels warm during the day.

DM: I went to Atami!  
HJ: Sounds good! Is it the sea?  
DM: Yes! To the sea and to eat delicious food!  
HJ: Does Atami have any local specialties?  
DM: I bought things like salted fish and dried fish for my friend.

DM: Definitely. I drank quite a bit while I was there.  
HJ: Hahaha. Did you go to a bar?  
DM: Yes. I went to a place like a seafood bar.  
HJ: That's the place! It seems like there are a lot of young people.

DM: And I drank highballs to the point of being drenched.  
HJ: Oh! Do you like highballs?  
DM: I like them! But I can't drink them straight.  
HJ: I like them too. I enjoy things like coke highballs.

HJ: Hello.  
DM: How do you spend your days off?

HJ: They have become quite popular lately.  
DM: Indeed, it's always crowded.  
HJ: Saunas tend to be that way.  
DM: Is it safe during the COVID-19 pandemic?  
HJ: The risk remains since it's the same bath.  
DM: It's surprising there haven't been any clusters. Do you visit the sauna often?  
HJ: Not for long periods.  
DM: My limit is 10 minutes.  
HJ: That's impressive! I can only last about 5 minutes.  
DM: Perhaps the temperature is lower where I go. Is your metabolism good?  
HJ: Possibly, but I get dizzy quickly.  
DM: A friend of mine collapsed from overexertion, so please be careful.  
HJ: That's concerning. I’ll make sure to take care.  ",7
