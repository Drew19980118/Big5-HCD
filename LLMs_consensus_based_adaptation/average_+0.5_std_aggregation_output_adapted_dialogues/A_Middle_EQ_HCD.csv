1,"EQ: Hello!  
AJ: Hello! How can I assist you today?  
EQ: Did you return to your hometown this year?  
AJ: No, I didn’t. My parents live nearby, so I didn't find it necessary. Did you go back for Obon?  
EQ: Yes, I went back this year. My husband's mother is elderly and needs support.  
AJ: I understand. How did you travel, by train or by car?  
EQ: I traveled by car. Since it was from the 14th to the 17th, the roads weren’t crowded.  
AJ: That must have been convenient. Did you also visit gravesites?  
EQ: No, since the welcoming fire was done on the 14th.  
AJ: I see. It's interesting to learn about different family traditions.  
EQ: My family didn't either; my father was the fourth son.  
AJ: Family roles can definitely influence such practices.  
EQ: Does the number of children affect such practices?  
AJ: Often, the eldest son inherits responsibilities. Distance also matters.  
EQ: Do you think living outside the prefecture makes a difference?  
AJ: Yes, if it's close, people might not go as often. It's quite common.   
EQ: Don’t you go even if it’s close? I can't go even if it’s far.  
AJ: That can happen. Holidays might be the only time to visit.  
EQ: Because of COVID-19, I didn't go back home for about a year and a half.  
AJ: That sounds challenging. How did you handle the traffic on the 14th?  
EQ: The expressway was crowded, especially towards the city.  
AJ: Sounds like the post-Obon rush. How are you feeling now?  
EQ: It’s been five days since I got home, and I'm still okay.  
AJ: That's good. Usually, symptoms appear within three days.   
EQ: If one person gets it, the whole family is affected, so it's better to be cautious.  
AJ: Absolutely. Is everyone in your family alright?  
EQ: That's happening everywhere now. My brother in Tokyo had food sent to him.  
AJ: It's good to know there's support for those in quarantine.  
EQ: Most food is ready-to-eat, so people are buying fresh foods online.  
AJ: Indeed. The internet has made many conveniences possible.",12,15,15,15,15

EQ: Do you sing along with the performances?
BO: Yes, many attendees, including overseas artists, were raising their voices.
EQ: Overseas artists also performed? Did you recognize any of them?
