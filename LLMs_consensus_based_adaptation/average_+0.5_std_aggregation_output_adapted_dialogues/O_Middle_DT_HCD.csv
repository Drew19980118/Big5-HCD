DT: Recent floods are scary.
CP: The weather has been unusual with heavy rain.
DT: It feels like a tropical climate.
CP: Smaller, consistent rain would be better.
DT: It's hard to tell if the rainy season is over.
CP: It didn't rain much during the rainy season.
DT: So that's why it's raining now.
CP: That could be it.
DT: It seems it's going to rain anyway.

CP: Hello! How can I assist you today?  
DT: Deciding dinner every day is quite a hassle. What's on the menu today?  
CP: Today's dish is Mapo eggplant.  
DT: Sounds good! Maybe I'll try that too.  
CP: Eggplants are in season now.  
DT: I don't buy eggplants often. Is it their season now?  
CP: Yes, they are in season, and these came from my father's vegetable garden.  
DT: Fresh ones must be delicious.  
CP: Yes, I appreciate that my parents live nearby. Do your parents live nearby?  
DT: Mine are far away, and I haven't visited in a few years.  
CP: It's difficult with the distance and COVID-19.  
DT: Yes, many people want to go home but can't due to COVID-19.  
CP: How do you usually travel back, by Shinkansen or airplane?  
DT: By Shinkansen, but I'm concerned about ventilation.

DT: It's uncomfortable when elevators are crowded.  
CP: Best to avoid crowded spaces. Staying safe is important.  
DT: I hope the pandemic ends soon.

4,"DT: Hello.
EM: Hello! How can I help you today?
DT: What are your hobbies?
EM: I enjoy working on bikes and cars. Are you interested in that?
DT: Not really. Do you focus on the interior or exterior of the car?
EM: I focus on fixing old things. It's rewarding.
DT: How old is your car?
EM: It was made in 1962. Do you know the Mini Cooper?
DT: Yes, many people drive Coopers. What model is yours?
EM: It's an old model made by Rover.
DT: It has a retro look. How do you handle maintenance?
EM: We fix issues quickly to avoid problems.
DT: I like old cars too, like the Fiat. Do they need a lot of care?
EM: The Cinque is simple to work on. I’d like to try it someday.
DT: Some cars are easier to tweak. What challenges do you face with yours?
EM: Cars are tougher for amateurs due to their structure and tools needed.
DT: Got it. Do you drive your Mini Cooper often?
EM: Yes, it's our only car.
DT: Do you take it on long trips?
EM: Mostly within Tokyo, sometimes to Nagano.
DT: How is the fuel economy?
EM: It’s about 7 kilometers per liter, needs high-octane fuel.
DT: Expected. It must feel special to drive.
EM: Yes, it does.
DT: Where can you find such old cars?
EM: I got mine at an auction, but they’re in used car listings too.
DT: How did you manage to get it at a good price?
EM: It was in decent condition and cost around 400,000 yen.
DT: Affordable for a vintage car.
EM: Needed repairs, so it was almost like buying scrap metal.",7,15,15,15,15
5,"DT: Please! EM: Please! DT: What did you eat for lunch today? EM: ""It was quite simple. It's like Kama-tama udon."" DT: I often have Kamatama udon for lunch. Do you like it cold or hot? EM: If I had to choose, it's rather warm, but good udon should be eaten cold, right? DT: Interesting. When I eat out, I've only tried Marugame or Hanamaru Udon. EM: Since I prefer home cooking, I tend to look for slightly better places when I eat out! DT: Are there many restaurants with delicious udon? EM: It usually happens during travel, but I had delicious udon in places like Fukushima and Chichibu! Also, Kagawa! DT: I want to try eating in Kagawa. Is it really different there? EM: The one in Kagawa was insanely delicious! It was surprising and cheap too! DT: I'm curious. It's the soul food of Kagawa Prefecture, right? EM: Yes. It's quite famous as a shop operating in a greenhouse. DT: A shop in a greenhouse is unusual. EM: Yes. I don't remember the name, but I can tell you about it! DT: It looks easy to enter casually, so I'll check it out sometime! EM: Sure. As a result of that influence, there are places where they serve kama-tama udon. DT: I see. Do they mix in things like eggs in the original version too? EM: That's right. I only got some croquette or something put on it. DT: That sounds nice. Even though I had lunch, I'm starting to want some udon. EM: Talking about it makes you want to eat it, doesn't it? DT: Exactly! I'm not hungry, but I can eat udon! EM: Indeed. Easy to eat. Maybe I'll have udon again for dinner. DT: Sounds good. But at night, it’s not going to be kamatama, right? EM: Well, the only delicious thing I can make at home is something like Kamatama udon. DT: Is that so? Doesn't the warmth depend on the noodle soup base? EM: The soup is basically ready-made. Shall we make yaki udon instead? DT: That's a great idea! I'll try it. EM: Let's do that!",1,15,15,15,15

EN: The new work is on hold. Please catch up to the latest when you can!  
DT: I paused reading both that and One Piece.

DT: I haven't seen it. Did you watch it?

DT: That's great. I'm looking forward to the movie!  
EN: I wanted to watch it soon to avoid spoilers.  
DT: Will there be spoilers online?  
EN: Yes, people talk about it in public places. One Piece is very popular.  
DT: That's surprising.  
EN: Officially, posting spoilers is allowed. It's hard to avoid them.  
DT: It'd be nice if spoilers could be avoided.  
EN: Given its popularity, it might be unavoidable.  
DT: The official stance doesn't prohibit spoilers.  
EN: It's strange, isn't it?",2,15,15,15,15

DY: That must have been challenging. How do they handle bath time at home?
DT: Bath time at home is fine. I misunderstood their readiness.
DY: That was unfortunate.

DY: It was. I also enjoyed the beautiful starry sky at night.
DT: It must have been very clear without light pollution.
