1,"EQ: Hello!  
AJ: Hello!  
EQ: Did you go back to your hometown this year?  
AJ: No, my parents' house is very close, so I didn't. How about you? Did you go back home for Obon?  
EQ: Yes, I went back to my hometown. My husband's mother is elderly.  
AJ: I see. Did you travel by train or car?  
EQ: By car. It was from the 14th to the 17th, so it wasn’t crowded.  
AJ: It's a bit late, but the timing was good. Did you visit gravesites?  
EQ: Since the welcoming fire was done on the 14th, I didn’t go to the grave.  
AJ: Understood. My family doesn't observe traditions like visiting graves or Obon, so I was curious.  
EQ: My family home also had little connection since my father was the fourth son.  
AJ: It seems there are people like that.  
EQ: I wonder if the number of children has anything to do with it.  
AJ: Since the eldest son usually inherits the family line, it matters. Family background also plays a role.  
EQ: Also, do they live outside the prefecture?  
AJ: That's true. When it's close, you end up not going.  
EQ: Don’t you go if it’s close? I can’t go even if it’s far.  
AJ: If it’s far, the only time to go back home is during holidays.  
EQ: Because of COVID-19, I refrained from going back home for about a year and a half.  
AJ: Understood. There may be an increase now since we couldn't go out before.  
EQ: The expressway was crowded on the 14th, especially towards the city.  
AJ: It's a U-turn. Obon is over, and the test results are in.  
EQ: That sounds concerning. It’s been five days since I got home, but I’m still okay.  
AJ: If five days pass, it should be okay. People usually feel unwell about three days later.  
EQ: Understood. When it happens, the whole family gets affected, so it’s better if we don’t get it.  
AJ: True. There are people around me whose families had to recuperate at home.  
EQ: It seems to be like that everywhere now. My brother is in Tokyo, and food was sent to him.  
AJ: Understood. They are distributing a considerable amount of food. People in hotel quarantine said the bento boxes are not very tasty.  
EQ: Food is mostly ready-to-eat, so fresh foods were bought online. It’s convenient.  
AJ: Agreed. The widespread use of the internet is beneficial.",2,15,15,15,15

EQ: I'd love to hear more about it. Can you tell me?
BO: Certainly! Do you often listen to music?
EQ: Not as much lately, but I enjoy music.
BO: There are festivals with both Western and Japanese music. You might enjoy them.
EQ: Where was this festival held?
BO: It was Summer Sonic in Makuhari.
EQ: That's a large venue, right?
BO: Yes, it has multiple stages. I walked a lot that day.
EQ: Walking over 20,000 steps must have been exhausting!
BO: Yes, I walked more than 20,000 steps.

BO: Hello. How can I assist you tonight?
EQ: Have you encountered any issues lately?
BO: My body feels increasingly heavy.
EQ: Do you mean you've gained weight?
BO: Yes, and my movements are sluggish.
EQ: Do you know why that might be?
BO: It could be due to a lack of exercise.
EQ: That makes sense. Many people feel less active these days.
BO: I used to be more active too, but now it's difficult.
EQ: The pandemic has made it harder for many people to go out.
BO: Exactly. I plan to exercise at home, but it's hard to stay motivated.
EQ: I recently joined a women-only gym. It could be a good option for you.
BO: That sounds interesting.
EQ: It's quite popular and comfortable, as everyone there is a woman.
BO: That peace of mind sounds beneficial.
EQ: The staff is friendly and supportive, and there are many elderly members.
BO: Are the staff members women as well?
EQ: Yes, all of them.
BO: That sounds great. I wish there was one nearby.
EQ: Some gyms offer 30-minute workouts which might fit your schedule.
BO: There are many gyms around, but I haven't seen a women-only one.
EQ: It may not feel like a typical gym. It suits a slower pace and varied needs.
BO: I understand. A hardcore gym can be intimidating.
EQ: I once overdid it at a regular gym, so this is a better fit for me.
BO: Taking it at your own pace is important.
EQ: It’s convenient since the whole trip takes just an hour.
BO: That sounds very practical. I might try to find one.
EQ: Please do search for it. Exercise can boost both physical and mental health.
BO: Thank you. I'll definitely look into it.",7,15,15,15,15

DF: I understand. Waking up early can be tough, especially when the weather changes.

DF: Cooler weather can indeed make it harder to get up. It’s cozy in bed, isn’t it?  
EQ: I took out my comforter yesterday.  
DF: That sounds like a good idea. Do you think it will get colder soon?  
EQ: I need to switch my clothes soon.
