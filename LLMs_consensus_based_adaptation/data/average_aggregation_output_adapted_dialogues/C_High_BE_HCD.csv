AQ: Hello.
BE: I bought a printer last week.
AQ: Did you not have one before?
BE: No, I didn’t. I’ve always wanted one.
AQ: Having one can be quite convenient.
BE: Yes, and I love that I can print photos!
AQ: Are you planning to print photos?
BE: Yes, I bought it specifically to print photos.
AQ: Does it print them well?
BE: Yes, it was pretty expensive, so the prints are really beautiful!
AQ: That sounds good.
BE: I printed all the photos from my smartphone one after another.
AQ: Did the ink run out quickly?
BE: Yes, it's already gone.
AQ: That is common.
BE: Ink is surprisingly expensive, isn't it?
AQ: Yes, it is quite costly.
BE: But I want to print, so I bought a lot!
AQ: Is it genuine ink?
BE: Can I use ink other than the genuine one?
AQ: Yes, there is also compatible ink.
BE: I didn’t know that.
AQ: Since you’ve already purchased it, it’s a bit late, but you can buy compatible ink on Rakuten Ichiba.
BE: I see! It seems cheaper on Rakuten.
AQ: Yes, you can get it for less than half the price of the genuine ink.
BE: Noted! Thanks for the tip.
AQ: You’re welcome. The durability and print quality may differ.
BE: I’ll try it. Goodbye.
AQ: Goodbye.",3,15,15,15,15
2,"BE: Hello  
AQ: Hi there!  
BE: Do you have a pet?  
AQ: No, I don't.  
BE: We have a cat and a hamster.  
AQ: That must be fun.  
BE: I have two cats, but they are always fighting.  
AQ: Are they indoor pets?  
BE: Yes, we live in an apartment.  
AQ: Their fights must get pretty intense.  
BE: Fur flies everywhere.  
AQ: That sounds challenging.  
BE: They sometimes eat each other's fur; it's scary.  
AQ: Are they male and female?  
BE: Yes.  
AQ: It's surprising they don’t get along.  
BE: There's no sign of affection between them.  
AQ: They must have strong personalities.  
BE: Will they ever get along?  
AQ: They might, given some time.  
BE: That could be interesting to see.  
AQ: I'm curious how it will turn out too.  
BE: I hope they become friends eventually.  
AQ: Makes sense. Do you have just one hamster?  
BE: We have two.  
AQ: Are they in separate cages?  
BE: Yes, so no fights.  
AQ: That's good planning.  
BE: Hamster fights can be intense.  
AQ: Sounds like it. Let's catch up again soon.",8,15,15,15,15

AQ: Hello.
BE: What is your favorite drink?
AQ: It’s milk.
BE: That's interesting.
AQ: It’s like a child’s drink, isn’t it?
BE: It does seem healthy.
AQ: I don't drink coffee or sweet juice.
BE: Do you ever have milk when you're out?
AQ: No, but I might drink it at a hot spring.
BE: Milk after a hot spring is common. Ever wondered why?
AQ: Yeah, why is that? The one in the bottle, right?
BE: The bottled one tastes great, doesn’t it?
AQ: Yes, why does it taste so good?
BE: I’m not a fan of milk, so I prefer fruit milk.
AQ: The sweet kind, right?
BE: Yes, it's really sweet.
AQ: Definitely! It’s very sweet.
BE: Do you like sugary drinks?
AQ: What do you usually drink?
BE: Coffee or tea, not juice.
AQ: Doesn’t coffee make you addicted?
BE: Is that a good thing or bad thing?
AQ: Yes.
BE: I drink it almost every day.
AQ: I’ve heard it helps with relaxation.
BE: Freshly ground coffee smells wonderful.
AQ: I might like the aroma.
BE: Talk to you next time.
AQ: See you again.",3,15,15,15,15
4,"BE: Hello.
AQ: Hello.
BE: Do you drink alcohol?
AQ: Do you consume alcohol?
BE: I occasionally drink, so I bought a SodaStream.
AQ: That sounds stylish.
BE: It's just a hassle to buy sparkling water every time!
AQ: Do you mix it with alcohol?
BE: Yes, it's a carbonated mix.
AQ: Got it.
BE: Recently, I only use it to mix with vinegar.
AQ: What is micho exactly?
BE: It's a type of fruit vinegar.
AQ: That sounds delicious.
BE: It's labeled as ""Miso"".
AQ: Does your husband also drink?
BE: I often drink it by myself.
AQ: Do you prefer drinking alone?
BE: Oh! My husband also drinks.
AQ: Understood.
BE: We drink together at home.
AQ: You drink different things together.
BE: That's right.
AQ: It's nice you can share the experience.
BE: Does AQ's husband drink?
AQ: We do not drink.
BE: Must be nice to save on alcohol costs!
AQ: That amount goes to snacks and eating out instead.
BE: I see, so there are snack costs too.
AQ: Correct. Let's continue this conversation later.",9,15,15,15,15
5,"BE: Hello!
AQ: Hello! How can I help you today?
BE: Do you have any pets?
AQ: Yes, I had a Java sparrow recently.
BE: Java sparrows are adorable. Was it hard to take care of it?
AQ: They need some care but are easier than larger animals.
BE: I love seeing them bathe. Do you have any dogs or cats?
AQ: No, I don’t. How about you?
BE: I have a cat and a hamster.
AQ: Like Tom and Jerry. Interesting.
BE: Unfortunately, the hamster got hurt once. It was really sad.
AQ: I'm sorry to hear that.
BE: Yes, there were bloodstains on the floor.
AQ: That sounds risky. It's good you’re more careful now.
BE: We’re taking extra care with the hamster.
AQ: That's important to prevent it from happening again.
BE: Thanks. We also upgraded to a sturdier cage.
AQ: That should help. Have you had other pets before?
BE: No, these are my first pets.
AQ: What breed is your cat?
BE: Scottish and Maine Coon.
AQ: Do you have two? What color are they?
BE: White and brown. The male is quite large.
AQ: Interesting.
BE: Our female cat is normal-sized.
AQ: Is it hard to manage if the cat is too big?
BE: It can be, but we manage.
AQ: Cats seem big compared to small birds.
BE: Yes, but small birds are very affectionate and cute.
AQ: They are. Thanks for sharing about your pets.",12,15,15,15,15

AF: Hello.
BE: Do you have any pets?
AF: Yes, fish and insects.
BE: Fish and insects? Interesting combination.
AF: Insects are for the kids. I have two tanks for tropical fish and goldfish.
BE: Is maintaining them difficult?
AF: My husband takes care of the cleaning.
BE: We kept fish too. Water quality is crucial.
AF: Yes. What type did you have?
BE: Tropical fish, like guppies.
AF: Small fish are cute.
BE: Are you keeping any large ones?
AF: I used to keep piranhas, now just small fish.
BE: Piranhas, that's impressive.
AF: It was something I always wanted to do.
BE: What do they eat?
AF: Bloodworms and pellets, because they are less messy.
BE: I thought they ate live prey.
AF: They can also eat raw fish. Extra guppies were food.
BE: Efficient but a bit sad.
AF: More practical than buying feeder fish.
BE: Is preparing their food hard?
AF: Raw fish may help them grow larger.
BE: Do you want them to grow bigger?
AF: Yes, I enjoy it.
BE: Watching them grow must be nice.
AF: It was sad when a big one died.
BE: That must have been tough.
AF: Now, I keep small ones. Goodbye.",18,15,15,15,15

AQ: Hello!
BE: What is your favorite drink?
AQ: I’ve been drinking a lot of barley tea recently.
BE: It feels like summer!
AQ: Yes, it does. And I also enjoy alcohol.
BE: What kind of alcohol do you like?
AQ: I prefer beer and sake.
BE: That's impressive.
AQ: Are you not good with it?
BE: I'm not good with it. It affects my throat.
AQ: Strong ones can be tough. Maybe try something lighter.
BE: Is Mio a type of Japanese sake?
AQ: Yes, it’s sparkling sake.
BE: That’s about all I can handle.
AQ: It seems it doesn’t suit you. Do you have any favorite drinks?
BE: I like coffee and green tea.
AQ: I like coffee too! Do you make it yourself?
BE: Yes, with an electric mill.
AQ: That’s efficient. I usually drink instant coffee.
BE: Instant coffee is quick.
AQ: Yes, a friend makes it well. It tastes good.
BE: Adjusting the grind is fun.
AQ: Does it make a big difference?
BE: Yes, it does.
AQ: You need to find one you like. I don't prefer sour ones.
BE: I also avoid strong sour tastes.

EJ: Hello.
BE: Do you have a favorite drink?
EJ: Ginger ale has become my recent favorite!
BE: I like ginger ale too!
EJ: It's delicious. The authentic ginger ale I had at the burger shop the other day was really good.
BE: Is it a bit spicy?
EJ: Yes, it was quite spicy. It had ginger paste in it.
BE: I drank something like that at a pancake shop.
EJ: Stores like that often have craft cola and such, which is nice.
BE: There are quite a lot of slightly luxurious drinks, aren't there?
EJ: Certainly. There are many drinks that are not found in regular bottled varieties.
BE: But that ginger ale was too spicy, so I couldn't drink it all!
EJ: Some can be quite spicy. Are you not good with spicy food?
BE: I'm not good with spicy foods, but I love wasabi.
EJ: Wasabi is okay for you!
BE: I'm not good with painful chili peppers.
EJ: Understood. Sometimes it really hurts, it's too painful.
BE: It hurts even more when it's hot, doesn't it?
EJ: That's true. The heat amplifies the spiciness. So, I choose medium spiciness for curry.
BE: I also prefer medium spicy curry!
EJ: I knew it! Medium spicy seems to balance flavor and heat well.
BE: If it’s sweet, it feels lacking.
EJ: That's right. Extremely spicy food can overshadow the dish’s actual taste.
BE: Certainly. There are quite a few foods that prioritize spiciness, aren't there?
EJ: Since the super spicy trend, there are more ways to market dishes as very spicy.
BE: I see, I don't really understand why spicy food is considered good.
EJ: Some people like the challenge, but moderation is better for enjoyment.
BE: I'm worried that you might get a stomachache.
EJ: That's a valid concern. Eating too much spicy food can be harsh on the stomach.",2,15,15,15,15

AQ: Hello!
BE: Have you been surprised by anything lately?
AQ: Yes, I was pleasantly surprised when the artist I wanted to see appeared unexpectedly at the festival I attended over the weekend.
BE: Was it a surprise appearance?
AQ: Yes, it was a surprise. Have you experienced any unexpected events recently?
BE: Yes, just a small one.
AQ: Can you tell me about it?
BE: I found out that it's not common everywhere to place an egg under Napolitan pasta.
AQ: This is the first time I've heard that there is an egg under Napolitan pasta.
BE: Really? It seems to be a regional thing.
AQ: Is it only common in that specific area?
BE: It appears so, even though it's delicious.
AQ: I always thought Napolitan was just pasta.
BE: It's often served on a hot iron plate. I thought it was a standard dish at coffee shops.
AQ: This is new information for me.
BE: Recently, these are the kind of small surprises I've experienced!
AQ: Regional variations can be quite interesting.
BE: We sometimes use local dialects without realizing it!
AQ: Being in Tokyo, I sometimes find certain dialects puzzling.
BE: Are you also from Tokyo?
AQ: Yes, I am.
BE: Tokyo has such a refined way of speaking.
AQ: However, some dialects can be difficult to understand.
BE: It can be challenging when you don't understand anything at all.
AQ: There are many cute dialects, which I think are charming.
BE: My region is known for its less cute dialect, so I admire the cute ones.
AQ: Dialects often spread widely.
BE: Strong dialects, like the Kansai dialect, tend to be more influential.
AQ: Right, sometimes they get adopted elsewhere in a peculiar way.",1,15,15,15,15

AQ: Some cat food uses premium ingredients like Makurazaki tuna.  
BE: Some people do choose high-quality options for their pets.  
AQ: People spend a lot on their pets.
