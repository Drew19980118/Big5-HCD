AJ: Hello! How can I assist you today?  
EQ: Did you go back to your hometown this year?  
AJ: No, my parents' house is nearby. Did you?  
EQ: Yes, to visit my husband's elderly mother.  
AJ: Understood. Did you travel by train or car?  
EQ: By car. We traveled from the 14th to the 17th. It wasn’t crowded.  
AJ: Did you visit gravesites?  
EQ: No, the welcoming fire was done on the 14th, so we didn't go.  
AJ: Got it. My family doesn’t observe those traditions.  
EQ: My father was the fourth son, so we didn't follow many traditions either.  
AJ: Understood. Larger families often have different dynamics.  
EQ: Do you think the number of children affects these traditions too?  
AJ: Yes, larger families can have various practices.  
EQ: And also the distance they live from the family home.   
AJ: Yes, distance often influences visits.  
EQ: If it's close, I make the effort. But if it's far, it's challenging.  
AJ: Long distances usually limit visits to holidays.  
EQ: Due to COVID-19, I avoided visiting home for a year and a half.  
AJ: Many have done the same. Travel has increased now.  
EQ: The expressway was crowded on the 14th.  
AJ: Likely due to people returning after Obon.  
EQ: It's been five days since I returned, but I'm still okay.  
AJ: That’s reassuring. Symptoms typically appear around three days later.  
EQ: One family member getting sick affects everyone.  
AJ: I understand. Many families are recuperating at home.  
EQ: My brother in Tokyo had food sent to him.  
AJ: They’re distributing substantial amounts. Hotel meals may not be the best.  
EQ: The food is mostly ready-to-eat; fresh items were bought online.  
AJ: The internet has indeed made things easier.",34,15,15,15,15

BO: Are all the staff members women too?

EQ: Some gyms offer quick 30-minute sessions.
BO: I've seen many gyms, but none that are women-only.
