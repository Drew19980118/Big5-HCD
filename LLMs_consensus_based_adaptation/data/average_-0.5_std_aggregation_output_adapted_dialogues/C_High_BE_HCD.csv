BE: It's great that I can print photos!
AQ: Are you going to print the photos?

AQ: Can it print nicely?
BE: Yes, it's really beautiful since it was fairly expensive!
AQ: That sounds nice.
BE: I've been printing out all the photos from my smartphone.
AQ: Does the ink run out quickly?

AQ: Quite a scene.

AQ: Are they male and female?
BE: Yes, one's male and the other's female.
AQ: Wouldn't they fall in love?

AF: Small fish like guppies are easier to manage.  
BE: Are you keeping bigger ones now?  
AF: I used to have piranhas, but now I only keep small tropical fish.  
BE: Piranhas? That's quite unique.  
AF: It was a dream of mine to keep one.  
BE: What do piranhas eat?  
AF: They eat bloodworms, but I feed them carnivorous pellets to avoid the smell.  
BE: I thought they only ate live organisms. Interesting.  
AF: They can eat raw fish too. When the guppies increased too much, I used them as food.  
BE: You used guppies as food? That must have been tough.  
AF: Yes, but it was practical.  
BE: Preparing bait must be a hassle.  
AF: Feeding raw fish might help them grow larger.  
BE: So, your goal is to grow them bigger?  
AF: Yes, I like to raise fish until they grow big.  
BE: Watching them grow must be rewarding.  
AF: I was very sad when one grew large and then suddenly died.  
BE: That must have been difficult.  
AF: So now, I only keep small fish. Goodbye!",8,15,15,15,15
