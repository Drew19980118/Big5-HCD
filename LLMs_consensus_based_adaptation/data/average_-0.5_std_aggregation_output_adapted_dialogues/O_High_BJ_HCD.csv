BS: Yes, I enjoy Kaji Yaro and Banana Man's Sekkaku Gourmet.
BJ: It feels like dinner time. You like comedians, don't you?
BS: I appreciate food shows that feature comedians. Do you watch TV often?
BJ: I see. Hmm, maybe about once or twice a week.
BS: Do you watch specific shows regularly?
BJ: Well, maybe something like Wednesday Downtown.
BS: That program starts around 10 PM, correct?
BJ: That's right. Haven't you seen it?
BS: I have seen it. It focuses on verifying various theories, correct?
BJ: Yes, that's right. Pranks are mainstream, aren't they?
BS: Understood. Do you like pranks or comedians?
BJ: I like pranks and comedians. Do you have a favorite comedian?
BS: Yes, Sandwichman and Jiro from Sissonne are my favorites. Just watching them makes me laugh.

BJ: I know! I often watch recipe videos.
BS: The video is interesting, isn't it? This is that person's recipe book.
BJ: That person who cooks while being completely drunk, right?
BS: That's right. On YouTube, he's all over the place, but on terrestrial TV, he's proper. It's that guy.
BJ: Ah, you are publishing a book. That sounds like it will be helpful.
BS: It's quick to make, so it's helpful during dinner time.
BJ: Is that book also available at the library?
BS: Yes, they have them. There are also quite a few recipe books, which is very helpful.
BJ: Wow, it's quite a large place, isn't it? I feel like going to the library again after a long time.
BS: The library is a good idea. They have magazines and such too.
BJ: More than anything, it's free, isn't it? It would be nice if there was a movie version of the library too.
BS: The library I go to also allows you to watch DVDs.
BJ: Such an amazing place! I'll go check it out next time. Thank you for the wonderful suggestion.
BS: Please enjoy yourself.",1,15,15,15,15

BL: Hello.
BJ: Is there anything you're not good at?
BL: Are you referring to food?
BJ: Anything in general.
BL: Well, I suppose that would be cockroaches.
BJ: I feel the same way. I really can't handle insects. Because of that, I don't eat shrimp.
BL: Understood.
BJ: It's kind of gross, isn't it?
BL: They have been around for a long time, so it's understandable.
BJ: By the way, what food do you dislike?

BJ: Is it the look or the taste?
BL: It's the texture.
BJ: Quite a few people dislike it, right?
BL: I know some people who can eat it.
BJ: Really? My younger sister doesn't like them either and would get in trouble for picking them out of bread.
BL: That bread can be quite problematic, not to mention raisin butter.
BJ: I haven't had much of that. How about rum raisin ice cream?
BL: I wouldn't choose that either.
BJ: Well, you can definitely live without eating raisins.
