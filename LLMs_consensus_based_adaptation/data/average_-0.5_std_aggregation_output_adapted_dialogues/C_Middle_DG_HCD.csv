DG: That sounds fun and educational.  
DV: I thought it might be good for brain activation.  
DG: Definitely. Some of the questions can be really challenging.  
DV: I find it hard to recall things even after studying.  
DG: We all forget things we don't use often.  
DV: I worry my child might soon be smarter than me.  
DG: Kids can really push us to keep learning.  
DV: If my child said, ""You don't understand this?"", I wouldn't be able to sleep.  
DG: That would be frustrating for sure.  
DV: We tend to forget things we don't use regularly.  
DG: Absolutely. What was your favorite subject?  
DV: Mathematics.  
DG: Mine was different.  
DV: I liked having definitive answers in math.

DV: The Japanese language is indeed complex.  
DG: It's difficult because it's so detailed in various ways.  
DV: Yes, different speaking styles can significantly change the impression.  
DG: There are so many homophones, it’s overwhelming.  
DV: It does seem challenging for foreigners to learn Japanese.  
DG: When I spoke Japanese on the phone overseas, I was happy to hear that the sound was clear.  
DV: That must have been gratifying. Have you traveled abroad? Which country did you visit?  
DG: I stayed with a host family in Australia.  
DV: That sounds interesting.  
DG: As an only child, it was refreshing to have siblings.  
DV: Was it a long-term stay or short-term?

DV: It's understandable to feel homesick after a prolonged period.  
DG: Yes, and the different food made me feel lonely.  
DV: Did you miss rice?  
DG: I missed Japanese food, like fish! It was all meat.  
DV: Is it true that Australia has more meat despite being surrounded by the ocean?  
DG: Yes, there was plenty of Aussie beef and lamb steak.

DG: Apparently, a child was bitten a little at the beach.  
DV: Yes, some were reported bitten. They look cute but can be scary. It's important to stay cautious.  
DG: I heard they're mischievous but strong.  
DV: Their size means even slight force can cause injury.  
DG: True, but their jumps are impressive and worth watching. I love those moments.  
DV: There used to be an event to touch dolphins, and they felt smooth. I remember it well.  
DG: That sounds great! I wonder what it feels like.  
DV: Smooth to the touch. It was a unique experience.  
DG: I bet their muscles are strong because they can jump so high.  
DV: There was also a feeding experience, but the timing didn’t match. It's a shame.  
DG: I would love to try that.  
DV: It was memorable.  
DG: I like to cool off by watching the shark tank.  
DV: Sharks can be scary, but some are gentle. It’s fascinating.

DG: Online shopping has become more common, hasn't it? I usually shop at Uniqlo.  
DV: They offer pants you can adjust yourself by cutting the hem.  
DG: Really? I wasn't aware of that.  
DV: Yes, the material doesn't fray when cut.  
DG: That's useful!  
DV: It's helpful for people who find the hems too long.  
DG: I dislike when the hem gets dirty from the ground.  
DV: Especially on rainy days.  
DG: Exactly. The hem often fades.  
DV: I used to wear heels and high-heeled boots.  
DG: Nowadays, I prefer more comfortable shoes.

DG: I should enjoy spicy foods while I can.

DG: Also, some gym-goers make a lot of noise on machines.  
DV: It's tough to exercise indoors with a mask on.  
DG: I'm becoming more of a neat freak these days.

DV: Yes, it can be quite tedious.
DG: I saw a long line at the booth and didn't get to taste it. Is it worth it?
DV: I used it initially, but now it's just sitting there.
DG: I might end up the same way. I want to avoid a bad purchase.
DV: That might be because I prefer iced coffee.
DG: Is making iced coffee with that machine difficult?
DV: Yes, you need a lot of ice.
DG: That sounds complicated. I'm not sure what to do.
DV: For customers, a different machine might be better.
DG: It doesn't seem practical for daily use. I need something easy for mornings.
