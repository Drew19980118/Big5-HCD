GQ: Yes, about once a week.

GD: What kind was it? Mine was a lop-eared rabbit.
GQ: Mine was a Nether mix with upright ears.
GD: A small breed? Did it grow bigger as a mix?
GQ: Yes, it grew quite a bit but not too big.
GD: Rabbits are usually a good size.
GQ: True. I now have a dog and a cat; a small rabbit would be easier.
GD: Is caring for them challenging with all the pets?
GQ: Yes, especially with rising food costs. We have one dog and one or two cats.
GD: That sounds like a lot to manage.
GQ: We had dogs outside; then a cat started living with us.
GD: Did the cat come for the dog?
GQ: Initially for the dog's food, but now it's being raised on the dog's milk.
GD: A nurse cat? Separated from its mother?

GD: You're welcome.
GQ: It's the season of good appetite, but are you thinking about dieting?
GD: Yes. Since I am above my ideal weight, I think about it all year.
GQ: Thinking about it too.
GD: Yes. I'm not good at exercising. Walking is difficult for me to keep up with.
GQ: But won't radio exercises help define my waist?
GD: I don't notice any change in my body shape. It just feels like my blood circulates better.

GD: Yes. My shoulder stiffness and lower back pain have reduced.
GQ: I switched to a smaller bowl, but I keep getting seconds.
GD: It's difficult to limit food intake with freshly cooked rice.

GD: Even with requests, I end up making what I want to eat.
GQ: Understood. I always say, ""Think about the menu!""
GD: It's challenging to have specific cravings all the time.
GQ: My child often asks for ""Hamburger!""
GD: It's hard to decide when the refrigerator isn't empty.
GQ: Planning the weekly menu in advance seemed like a good idea, but it only worked for two weeks.
GD: Did anyone share their opinions?
GQ: Yes. We planned with Japanese, Western, and Chinese styles.
GD: Did it make cooking easier?
GQ: Sometimes I didn't have enough time, making it difficult.
GD: Plans don't always work out. Three days' worth seems manageable.
GQ: That's right. It feels practical.
GD: A week feels too long. Three days might work better.
GQ: Considering ingredient shelf life, three days is good.
GD: Planning within that span is a good idea.
GQ: I'll give it a try.
GD: I will too!",3,15,15,15,15
