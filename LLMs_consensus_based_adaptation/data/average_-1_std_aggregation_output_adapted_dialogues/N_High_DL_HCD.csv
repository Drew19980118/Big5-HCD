DK: Welcome. How can I assist you today?  
DL: Do you have any favorite foods, minkabu?  
DK: I don't have preferences, but I enjoy katsudon and had it today.  
DL: I love katsudon too! I just ate it this morning!  
DK: Eating katsudon in the morning sounds interesting.  
DL: I tend to eat more in the morning and lightly at night.  
DK: Has this been your routine for a long time?  
DL: Yes, it's from when I was on a diet.  
DK: Eating before bed can contribute to weight gain.  
DL: But don't you think late-night snacks can be indulgent?  
DK: Yes, it can be tempting. I would make instant yakisoba and drink alcohol as a late-night snack.  
DL: That sounds like a perfect combination! Now, I feel like eating something too.  
DK: Recently, I've been refraining from drinking at night.  
DL: Are you trying to have alcohol-free days?  
DK: I don't drink every day, and recently I've had more non-alcoholic drinks. I only drink during dinner.  
DL: I haven't had any non-alcoholic drinks recently. How do they taste?  
DK: Domestic non-alcoholic beers have a strong aroma, but low-alcohol Beery is good.  
DL: I still think the real thing is the best.  
DK: I often drink German-made non-alcoholic beer from Gyomu Super.  
DL: I go to Gyomu Super often. They have various kinds of alcohol, right?  
DK: Yes, I mainly buy alcohol and sweets.  
DL: Do you have any recommendations?  
DK: The spicy Mala Ikari Beans sold exclusively at Gyomu Super are good.  
DL: Thank you. I'll look for them next time. I often buy squid fries.  
DK: Fried squid goes well with beer.  
DL: That saltiness is perfect with beer.  
DK: That sounds good. I feel like having a drink now.  
DL: Me too. I'm also curious about those beans.  
DK: Given the time, it's best to wait.",2,15,15,15,15

DL: I was a little put off by the design. Should I try reading it anyway?
DK: What kind of manga do you usually like?
DL: I read a variety. I also enjoy JoJo.
DK: JoJo is interesting. Fable has its own quirks. What is your favorite manga right now?
DL: It changes, but I currently like ""The Last Restaurant.""
DK: I see. I haven't read it. ""The Fable"" was recommended to me.
DL: Did you get hooked after trying to read it? Avoiding it because of the art style might be a waste, right?
DK: Yes, that's correct. Kaiji is also very interesting.
DL: I like Kaiji too! I was put off by it at first.
DK: Right? The other series by the same author, like ""Ten,"" ""Akagi,"" and ""Gin to Kin,"" are also interesting.
DL: I haven't read any of the other series. Which one do you recommend the most?
DK: ""Ten"" and ""Silver and Gold"" are highly rated. I recommend ""Silver and Gold.""
DL: Got it! I'll definitely read it! I've read spin-offs like ""Hanchou"" and ""Tonegawa.""
DK: I love both of them.
DL: They are interesting!
DK: Yes, it's good to read them after the main story.
DL: I agree! When someone thought Kaiji was the spin-off, I laughed.
DK: That's quite funny!
DL: That response is perfect! Reading them out of order can be confusing.
DK: Yes, order is important.
DL: I'll read ""Silver and Gold"" for now. I'm looking forward to it!
