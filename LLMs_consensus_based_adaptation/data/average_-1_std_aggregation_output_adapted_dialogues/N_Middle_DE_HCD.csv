1,"DE: Hello. Nice to meet you.
CR: Hello. How can I assist you?
DE: What are your hobbies?
CR: I stay active by training at the gym.
DE: Is it some kind of sport? Or is it training or something?
CR: I train at the gym.
DE: That sounds cool. I also went to the gym, but I couldn't keep it up.
CR: Having a goal could help with motivation.
DE: I see. I usually just walk my dog.
CR: Walking the dog sounds enjoyable.
DE: The heat was so intense in the summer that I hesitated to go for a walk, but walking together is enjoyable.
CR: Weather impacts activities.
DE: Yes, yes. The gym isn't affected by the heat or cold, right?
CR: The gym environment is stable year-round.
DE: Do you also use running machines?
CR: Yes, I run on the treadmill for 30 minutes.
DE: That's healthy. I used to use a machine with an adjustable incline at the gym.
CR: The incline makes it tougher.
DE: When there's an incline, it puts quite a load on you. It felt like mountain climbing.
CR: Walking at an incline is challenging.
DE: How many hours a day do you train?
CR: I train twice a week for 2 hours each.
DE: That's a moderate amount. Consistency is key.
CR: If it's too much, you might quit.
DE: I see. And then I retired. Hahaha.
CR: Balance is important.
DE: During the pandemic, I did Zumba indoors.
CR: Did you use YouTube videos?
DE: Yes. The music keeps me motivated.
CR: That sounds fun.",7,15,15,15,15
2,"DE: Hello.
CR: Hello.
DE: Do you plan to go out in the fall?
CR: I'm considering a trip, but...
DE: How is the COVID-19 situation?
CR: It remains a concern.
DE: Where do you want to go?
CR: Noto.
DE: Noto or Toyama?
CR: Yes, I've never been there.
DE: The fish are delicious, like sweet shrimp and yellowtail.
CR: I want to try the fish.
DE: Fish from the Sea of Japan are tasty.
CR: They are known for their variety.
DE: Considering the Hokuriku Shinkansen?
CR: Deciding between the plane or the Shinkansen.
DE: Planes are fast.
CR: Is the Shinkansen fast?
DE: It depends on the airport location.
CR: It's complex.
DE: Renting a car is an option.
CR: Renting from the airport is convenient.
DE: You can visit many places.
CR: There are interesting spots in smaller areas.
DE: A trip to Hokuriku sounds good. Visiting Kanazawa?
CR: If staying for two nights, I want to visit Kanazawa.
DE: The castle town is nice, like Kenrokuen.
CR: I've been to Kanazawa before.
DE: Planning is part of the fun.
CR: Hoping COVID-19 settles down.",3,15,15,15,15
3,"DE: Hello!
CR: Hello.
DE: Do you enjoy listening to music?
CR: Yes, I listen to FM radio.
DE: Oh, J-WAVE is playing here too.
CR: I use Radiko on my smartphone during my commute.
DE: Radiko is handy for catching up later.
CR: It's clearer than radio waves.
DE: Was it noisy before?
CR: I watched TikTok recently and found EDM cool.
DE: What is EDM?
CR: It's electronic dance music.
DE: Do you dance to it?
CR: It's for clubs and live shows.
DE: Do you enjoy it through videos?
CR: It's like dancing at a club.
DE: COVID-19 made clubs hard to visit, but people still go.
CR: I'd like to try it someday.
DE: Before COVID, I went often. It’s fun to move to music.
CR: I went once, but it was boring.
DE: What genres do you enjoy?
CR: Not enka. Last concert I saw was Lady Gaga's.
DE: Have you seen Top Gun?
CR: Yes.
DE: I watched it twice.
CR: Twice! I cried at the end.
DE: Me too, from the intro.
CR: It was so cool.
DE: Full of entertainment.

4,"DE: Hello.  
CR: Hello. How can I assist you today?  
DE: Do you like coffee?  
CR: Yes, I drink it with sugar and milk. How about you?  
DE: I see. I'm more into black coffee.  
CR: What kind of black coffee do you prefer?  
DE: I enjoy coffee with strong acidity and fruity notes, like Ethiopian coffee.  
CR: That's an interesting choice. Not everyone enjoys black coffee.  
DE: I understand. I didn't like it either until I started working. Sweet things aren't really my preference.  
CR: That makes sense. Many people have specific tastes when it comes to coffee.  
DE: I enjoy coffee, but I'm sensitive to caffeine. I prefer small amounts or decaf.  
CR: That's practical. Many drink coffee for alertness.  
DE: I drink it to stay awake at work.  
CR: Caffeine can affect individuals differently.  
DE: Are there differences in how caffeine affects people?  
CR: It could be due to individual constitution.  
DE: That could be it. Thick matcha was quite intense during my tea ceremony practice.  
CR: Are you interested in tea ceremonies?  
DE: Yes, the tea ceremony is profound and rewarding.  
CR: Would starting with a one-day trial course be a good idea?  
DE: Yes, checking the classroom atmosphere beforehand is a good idea.  
CR: What kind of atmosphere should I look for?  
DE: A classroom where you can truly experience wabi-sabi, without unrelated topics.  
CR: Do unrelated topics often come up?  
DE: My previous classroom focused on tea ceremony only, but the new one in Tokyo was different.  
CR: Is that why you quit?  
DE: Yes, it was too different. I didn't want to quit, but...  
CR: I hope you find a better place soon.  
DE: Thank you. I hope you find a good classroom too.  
CR: A classroom with delicious snacks would be a bonus.",10,15,15,15,15
5,"DE: Good evening!
BG: Good evening! What kind of hobbies do you have?
DE: I've tried various things, but recently I'm interested in DIY projects.
BG: DIY is great. There are many parts available, so it must be fun to choose them.
DE: Yes, it's also fun to plan the process. What are your hobbies?
BG: I enjoy writing essays, walking, taking photos, playing the piano, and listening to Fujii Kaze.
DE: Essays? That's impressive.
BG: It's like extending a diary and writing about your thoughts.
DE: That makes sense. It's helpful for organizing your thoughts.
BG: Writing when you want makes it easier than keeping a daily diary.
DE: I often struggle with daily writing, but I might try doing it occasionally.
BG: You should. It's interesting to look back later.
DE: Reading old blog posts can be nice. I'm glad I wrote them.
BG: I've blogged before too. I still have one, but it's inactive. Now, I focus on handwriting.
DE: Do you have any favorite stationery?
BG: I like various writing instruments, especially ballpoint pens.
DE: I'm a stationery enthusiast too. I bought a fountain pen I haven't used yet.
BG: Fountain pens are popular. I used one before but now mostly use ballpoint pens.
DE: What pen size do you use?
BG: 0.5 is the best. The Uni Jetstream is amazing.
DE: I'll check it out at the store. You prefer thin pens?
BG: Yes, they make writing thank-you letters easier.
DE: You must write well.
BG: Not really. I also enjoy doodling with colored brush pens.
DE: Since you do it for work, you must be good at it. I gave up on penmanship courses.
BG: You took a penmanship course? They are often too short.
DE: I practice common characters, but not others.
BG: It's tough to practice consistently.
DE: It would be nice if writing was enjoyable.
BG: Enjoying it is the best.",2,15,15,15,15
6,"DE: Hello. Please!
BF: Yes, thank you.
DE: Did you have a summer vacation?
BF: I don't work, so every day feels like summer vacation. How about you?
DE: I couldn't go home for the summer because I had to work without any vacation. How did you spend your summer?
BF: That must have been tough. I went on a trip with my family during Obon.
DE: Where did you go?

DE: Not really. What's in your fridge?  
BF: Daily menu planning can be challenging.  
DE: Absolutely! Do you shop for groceries daily?  
BF: I do bulk shopping on weekends.  
DE: Me too. When my fridge is low, I often make stir-fries.  
BF: Fridays often leave my fridge quite empty.  
DE: True. Recipe searches often lead to stir-fries.

DE: How far is your nearest supermarket?  
BF: There are several within a 10-minute walk.

BF: I might get yakitori for dinner.  
DE: Takeout is more common now.  
BF: Yes, due to COVID.  
DE: Nice to enjoy food without dining in.  
BF: Entering stores can sometimes be intimidating.  
DE: Exactly! More convenient than eating out.  
BF: Indeed.  
DE: The takoyaki from my local supermarket is amazing! You should try it sometime.
