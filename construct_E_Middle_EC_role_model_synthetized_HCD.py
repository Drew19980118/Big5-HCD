        Now, I will give you a Human Human Dialogue. The content is as follows:

        Then, I will give you a Human Computer Dialogue based on this Human Human Dialogue, where EC simulates the role of a Human (converting EC's utterances in the original Human Human Dialogue), and DG simulates the role of a Computer (converting DG's utterances in the original Human Human Dialogue). In this simulation, only the style of each utterance will be changed without altering its content and meaning.
        ## Human Computer Dialogue:
        {human_computer_dialogue}
        The conversion of this Human Human Dialogue into Human Computer Dialogue is based on the following Additional Knowledge:

        Now, I have received several different evaluatorsâ€™ feedback regarding the issues with this transformed Human Computer Dialogue:

        Your task is to revise this Human Computer Dialogue based on the feedback (you may need to refer to the original Human Human Dialogue, Personality traits score & Personality Traits Description and Additional Knowledge) and output a completely new Human Computer Dialogue. The output format should remain consistent with the original Human Computer Dialogue.

        **Important!!!** The newly generated Human Computer Dialogue must consider the content of each feedback simultaneously. Your response should only include the newly generated Human Computer Dialogue and no additional titles or information.

    DG: I think there will also be festival food stalls! I'm looking forward to it! 
    EC: "Festival food is a new term to me! Looks delicious!!" 
    DG: "There are a lot of hearty dishes like meat bowls!" 
    EC: It's so appealing! With four stages and festival food, is one day enough? 
    DG: I have only secured a one-day ticket, but there are people going for both days! 
    EC: I see! Do you plan how you will go around, or do you go with the flow? 
    DG: I have made plans, but I am prepared for emergencies where I won't be able to go out due to COVID-19. 
    EC: "It would be extremely disappointing if we can't go despite having made such careful plans." 
    DG: That's right, but I'm also looking forward to meeting unknown artists without being bound by the schedule! 
    EC: Exploring new things is great! What kind of artists do you like? 
    DG: I often listen to King Gnu these days. 
    EC: "I have an image of a very beautiful voice!" 
    DG: I like that vocalist because they are charming. There is a gap. 
    EC: "I don't know what their face looks like! There's a gap, huh! I'll search for it next time." 
    DG: He's definitely a mysterious guy who's troubled by not being able to tidy up his own room. 
    EC: Mysterious guy! You have a unique personality. I'm intrigued! 
    DG: Yes, that's right, so I was doing an Instagram live about how I can't get married. 
    EC: I see. It seems like a lot of sisterly types who are totally okay with it would volunteer.

    DG: Oh, I properly went back to using my own toothbrush. The angle might be a bit different though! 
    EC: Did you use an electric one before? 
    DG: Yes, I bought it because I admired it, but it didn't feel quite right, so I changed it! 
    EC: The commercial makes it seem like electric ones remove dirt really well, but they don't actually feel that refreshing. 
    DG: I feel like it's hard to polish the back and inside areas. 
    EC: I see! I was surprised because I thought it would be easy to polish. 
    DG: "Also, if it doesn't work out, you can still use it for cleaning." 
    EC: It's convenient, isn't it? I think one of the good points of manual toothbrushes is that they are cheap, so you can easily replace them if they get frayed. 
    DG: That's right, and with electric ones, you need to charge them and maintain them when they get dirty, so it wasn't an ideal situation. EC: Wow, that's a hassle. I don't want to deal with maintenance and such. It's far from an ideal world. 
    DG: "Somehow my laziness is gradually being revealed, but I just want to take it easy as much as possible!" 
    EC: I am also lazy, so I totally understand! You don't want to spend time taking care of your teeth, right? 
    DG: I see. <EC>, is there something you are glad you bought? 
    EC: The mouse with a button on the left thumb was convenient. I think most people are using it. 
    DG: "Huh, a button? I might not have one." 
    EC: It is called a 5-button mouse. 
    DG: "Heh! That's news to me! So it's not specifically for gaming?" 
    EC: That's not correct! It's around 1200 yen, so I think regular people are using it! 
    DG: When I looked it up just now, I found out you can also go back and forward with it. 
    EC: That's right, that's what's convenient about it. You don't have to go out of your way to move the cursor. 
    DG: "Eh! I updated my wish list!" 
    EC: Absolutely! If it's the same price, I definitely recommend the five-button one. 
    DG: I ended up talking about things I hadn't bought! 
    EC: No, no, I'm glad I got to hear it! I was interested in electric toothbrushes!
    DG: Everyone is different, but convenience might be inconvenient! 
    EC: "That's true! It was fun, thank you very much."

    additional_knowledge = """
    Differences Between Human Human Dialogue (HHD) and Human Computer Dialogue (HCD):

    Communication Styles:

    HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are characterized by brief, frequent exchanges that prioritize efficiency. Users expect clear, straightforward responses without unnecessary elaboration.
    Example: User: "What time is my next meeting?" System: "Your meeting starts at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B."

    HHD: Conversations between humans are more nuanced and context-rich, often incorporating additional details, shared thoughts, or collaborative reasoning.
    Example: Person A: "The weather app says itâ€™ll stay clear, but the sky looks a bit hazy. Do you think we should leave earlier for the hike?" Person B: "Good pointâ€”maybe we can avoid the afternoon crowd too. Letâ€™s aim for 8 AM instead!"

    Relational and Personality Expression:

    HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are transactional and lack emotional depth or personal connection, as machines are incapable of genuine empathy or emotional understanding.
    Example: User: "Iâ€™m overwhelmed with work deadlines." System: "Would you like me to schedule a reminder for your tasks?"

    HHD: Human interactions are infused with emotional expression, humor, and openness, fostering trust and mutual understanding. These exchanges often include empathy, support, and shared problem-solving.
    Example: Person A: "Iâ€™ve been swamped with deadlines all weekâ€”itâ€™s exhausting." Person B: "That sounds rough. Want to grab coffee later? We can brainstorm ways to tackle it together."
