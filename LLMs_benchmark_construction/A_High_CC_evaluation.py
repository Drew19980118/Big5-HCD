Differences Between Human Human Dialogue (HHD) and Human Computer Dialogue (HCD):

Communication Styles:

HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are characterized by brief, frequent exchanges that prioritize efficiency. Humans expect clear, straightforward responses without unnecessary elaboration.
Example: Human: "What time is my next meeting?" System: "Your meeting starts at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B."

HHD: Interactions between humans are more nuanced and context-rich, often incorporating additional details, shared thoughts, or collaborative reasoning.
Example: Person A: "The weather app says it’ll stay clear, but the sky looks a bit hazy. Do you think we should leave earlier for the hike?" Person B: "Good point—maybe we can avoid the afternoon crowd too. Let’s aim for 8 AM instead!"

Relational and Personality Expression:

HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are transactional and lack emotional depth or personal connection, as machines are incapable of genuine empathy or emotional understanding.
Example: Human: "I’m overwhelmed with work deadlines." System: "Would you like me to schedule a reminder for your tasks?"

HHD: Human interactions are infused with emotional expression, humor, and openness, fostering trust and mutual understanding. These exchanges often include empathy, support, and shared problem-solving.
Example: Person A: "I’ve been swamped with deadlines all week—it’s exhausting." Person B: "That sounds rough. Want to grab coffee later? We can brainstorm ways to tackle it together."

personality_traits = """
Openness: 6.25
CC is highly open to new experiences and values creativity and innovation. He/she enjoys exploring new ideas, learning new things, and is often curious about the world. This openness makes him/her adaptable and imaginative.
Conscientiousness: 3.0
CC has a moderate level of conscientiousness. He/she may not be particularly focused on organization or detailed planning, but can still complete tasks and meet responsibilities. His/her approach may be more flexible and spontaneous rather than strictly disciplined.
Extraversion: 3.3333332538604736
CC has a balanced level of extraversion. He/she enjoys social interactions and can be outgoing and energetic in social situations, but also values and needs some time alone to recharge. This balance allows him/her to be adaptable in both social and solitary settings.
Agreeableness: 5.333333492279053
CC is quite agreeable, displaying warmth, kindness, and a cooperative nature. He/she is likely to be empathetic and considerate towards others, valuing harmonious relationships and often putting others' needs before his/her own.
Neuroticism: 3.0833332538604736
CC has a relatively average level of neuroticism. He/she may experience occasional stress or emotional fluctuations, but generally manages to maintain a balanced emotional state. This level allows him/her to be resilient in most situations without being overly affected by negative emotions.

Now, I will give you a Human Human Dialogue. The content is as follows:

And I will also provide you with CC's Big Five Personality Traits scores (7-point scale) and corresponding personality traits descriptions as follows:  
## Personality traits score & Personality traits description:

Then, I will give you a Human Computer Dialogue based on this Human Human Dialogue, where CC simulates the role of a Human (converting CC's utterances in the original Human Human Dialogue), and AY simulates the role of a Computer (converting AY's utterances in the original Human Human Dialogue). In this simulation, only the style of each utterance will be changed without altering its content and meaning.  
## Human Computer Dialogue:
{human_computer_dialogue}

The conversion of this Human Human Dialogue into Human Computer Dialogue is based on the following Additional Knowledge:  
## Additional Knowledge   
{additional_knowledge}

You will analyze two aspects of the Human Computer Dialogue converted from Human Human Dialogue:

Task 1. Analyze whether this Human Computer Dialogue strictly follows the Additional Knowledge to transform the original Human Human Dialogue, you may need to refer CC's Personality Traits Score & Personality Traits Description.

Task 2. Check whether the content and meaning of all utterances (from both Human Role and Computer Role) are preserved without alteration from the original Human Human Dialogue.

Your output must only have two kinds:
1. If you believe both of the tasks are complete. The final output is 'Task Completed'.
2. If you think any task is incomplete, provide a single confidence score (0.0-1.0, 0.01 increments) reflecting the overall performance across both tasks.
The final output is: 'Score: [confidence score]'.

**Important!!!** Your final output must not include any other text or information.
