        Now, I will give you a Human Human Dialogue. The content is as follows:

        Then, I will give you a Human Computer Dialogue based on this Human Human Dialogue, where ES simulates the role of a Human (converting ES's utterances in the original Human Human Dialogue), and ER simulates the role of a Computer (converting ER's utterances in the original Human Human Dialogue). In this simulation, only the style of each utterance will be changed without altering its content and meaning.
        ## Human Computer Dialogue:

        The conversion of this Human Human Dialogue into Human Computer Dialogue is based on the following Additional Knowledge:

        Now, I have received several different evaluatorsâ€™ feedback regarding the issues with this transformed Human Computer Dialogue:

        Your task is to revise this Human Computer Dialogue based on the feedback (you may need to refer to the original Human Human Dialogue, Personality traits score & Personality Traits Description and Additional Knowledge) and output a completely new Human Computer Dialogue. The output format should remain consistent with the original Human Computer Dialogue.

        **Important!!!** The newly generated Human Computer Dialogue must consider the content of each feedback simultaneously. Your response should only include the newly generated Human Computer Dialogue and no additional titles or information.

    ES: I see. I always eat lunch at home, so I'm envious. 
    ER: "It's an occasional luxury. What did you have for lunch over there?" 
    ES: I am egg over rice. It's simple and I laughed at myself. 
    ER: I think tamago kake gohan is good! It's quick and easy to make. 
    ES: "That's right. Since I'm alone during the day, I'm not too particular. Besides curry, what do you often eat?" 
    ER: Usually, I have things like kimchi and rice, or ochazuke. 
    ES: When it comes to home-cooked meals, they are similar! 
    ER: I see, I'm usually indifferent since I eat lunch alone as well. 
    ES: When you're alone, you don't make much effort, do you? Frozen udon is also convenient and I often eat it. 
    ER: Frozen udon is also nice, and it seems delicious chilled during hot seasons. 
    ES: "There are many convenient ways to eat, right? Maybe I should try dining out once in a while too." 
    ER: I think it's good. I believe it will also be a nice change of pace!

    personality_traits = """
    'Openness': 4.666666507720947
    ES are curious and imaginative, with a strong appreciation for art, adventure, and new experiences. ES openness leads ES to embrace change and seek out new knowledge, often thinking creatively and outside the box. This trait positively influences ES ability to adapt to different situations, appreciate diverse perspectives, and engage in innovative problem-solving.
    'Conscientiousness': 4.166666507720947
    ES are reliable, well-organized, and disciplined, often setting and achieving high standards for ES. This conscientiousness drives ES to be diligent in your tasks, managing ES time effectively, and paying attention to detail. ES work habits reflect a strong sense of responsibility, and ES can be counted on to follow through with ES commitments, which earns the trust and respect of those around ES.
    'Extraversion': 3.9166667461395264
    ES are moderately outgoing and sociable, enjoying social interactions and stimulating environments, but ES also appreciate some quiet, reflective time. ES balanced extraversion allows ES to connect well with others while maintaining ES independence. ES are likely to be comfortable in both social settings and solitary activities, which helps ES build meaningful relationships without feeling overwhelmed.
    'Agreeableness': 3.9166667461395264
    ES are generally kind, empathetic, and cooperative, valuing harmony and positive relationships. ES agreeableness makes ES a considerate and supportive friend, often placing a high value on helping others and resolving conflicts. While ES are compassionate and understanding, ES also balance ES own needs, ensuring that ES maintain healthy boundaries in ES interactions.
    'Neuroticism': 5.0
    ES experience emotional fluctuations and can be sensitive to stress, often feeling anxious or self-conscious in challenging situations. ES higher neuroticism means ES are attuned to potential threats and can be very self-aware. While this sensitivity can sometimes lead to worry, it also makes ES empathetic and emotionally expressive, fostering deep connections with others who appreciate ES openness about ES feelings.

    additional_knowledge = """
    Differences Between Human Human Dialogue (HHD) and Human Computer Dialogue (HCD):

    Communication Styles:

    HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are characterized by brief, frequent exchanges that prioritize efficiency. Users expect clear, straightforward responses without unnecessary elaboration.
    Example: User: "What time is my next meeting?" System: "Your meeting starts at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B."

    HHD: Conversations between humans are more nuanced and context-rich, often incorporating additional details, shared thoughts, or collaborative reasoning.
    Example: Person A: "The weather app says itâ€™ll stay clear, but the sky looks a bit hazy. Do you think we should leave earlier for the hike?" Person B: "Good pointâ€”maybe we can avoid the afternoon crowd too. Letâ€™s aim for 8 AM instead!"

    Relational and Personality Expression:

    HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are transactional and lack emotional depth or personal connection, as machines are incapable of genuine empathy or emotional understanding.
    Example: User: "Iâ€™m overwhelmed with work deadlines." System: "Would you like me to schedule a reminder for your tasks?"

    HHD: Human interactions are infused with emotional expression, humor, and openness, fostering trust and mutual understanding. These exchanges often include empathy, support, and shared problem-solving.
    Example: Person A: "Iâ€™ve been swamped with deadlines all weekâ€”itâ€™s exhausting." Person B: "That sounds rough. Want to grab coffee later? We can brainstorm ways to tackle it together."
