1,"DT: Nice to meet you. CO: ""Nice to meet you, too."" DT: Did you go out somewhere today? CO: No, I stayed home all day. DT: When it's hot, you don't feel like going out, right? CO: I see. I opened the balcony, and it was too hot, so I didn't feel like going outside. DT: Are you not good with summer? CO: I like summer. I want to go out and have fun because I like things like the sea. DT: I see. Did you go to the beach this year? CO: I haven't gone. I don't think I'll go this year either. Not until the coronavirus ends. DT: When will it end? CO: ""That's true. Won't it be over after autumn since the peak has passed?"" DT: Hmm, I wonder. It seems tough... CO: Is it strict? DT: We can't go on a trip, can we? CO: I see. Do you like traveling? DT: I like it. But I prefer overseas, so I can't go at all. CO: I see. Where was the last place you traveled abroad? DT: It is Sweden. CO: ""Is it Northern Europe? I wonder if it's cold."" DT: I went in September, but it was already cold. CO: What is that place famous for? DT: It is said to be the setting for Kiki's Delivery Service. CO: I see. Wasn't IKEA from Sweden? DT: That's right! There was no IKEA in the city, so I didn't go. CO: Is it like that? As expected, you can go to IKEA in Japan, right? DT: Sure. ""Yes. IKEA is sufficient in Japan."" CO: ""Is it often Europe? Travel"" DT: I see. I was flying around using LCC. CO: Jealous. I want to go there someday."
2,"DT: Good evening. CO: Good evening! DT: Have you bought anything recently? Other than food. CO: Recently, I bought things like clothes and bags. DT: Do you often buy clothes? CO: ""Not really. I usually wear secondhand clothes, but this time I bought something for work."" DT: I see. Do you do more remote work or work in the office? CO: I have been going to the office more frequently now. Things have settled down a bit. DT: Do you wear a suit when you go to the office? CO: Now it's office casual. It's okay to wear a shirt and pants. DT: ""It's easy and nice, isn't it?"" CO: Yes, I have a lot of fieldwork now, so I can wear sneakers, and they are really comfortable. DT: That was good. It seems tough to work outside during the summer. CO: ""It's unbearable. I feel like I'm going to get heatstroke. Are you working?"" DT: It's essential to carry water with you. I am currently focusing on childcare. CO: I see. Have you bought anything recently? DT: Recently, I bought clothes for the baby. There are so many cute ones that just looking at them is fun. CO: ""Oh, does it become something like Nishimatsuya? Speaking of baby clothes."" DT: Yes. Akachan Honpo and such. CO: I see. Sometimes I go to buy something for my friend's child. DT: ""Is that so? Are you giving a present?"" CO: Yes, when I was born. But I'm not sure what to buy. DT: I think anything would make them happy. I think a small toy would be nice. CO: I see, I was wondering if there are any preferences. Is any toy okay? DT: ""It seems like there are preferences for characters, so something other than characters. Like a rattle with animals on it."" CO: Ah, I see. That opinion is helpful. DT: I was happy to receive a toy made of rice as a present from my cousin. CO: Rice? That's unusual. Is it sold normally? DT: ""They sell it. I was impressed because it's made from rice, so I feel safe putting it in my mouth."" CO: Wow, that's interesting. I'll use it as a reference."
3,"DT: Hello. Nice to meet you. CP: ""Likewise, thank you in advance!"" DT: What were you doing this morning? CP: ""I haven't really done anything special. Just hung out the laundry."" DT: It's so hot that I don't feel like going out, right? CP: ""That's right. And it's raining here too."" DT: In that case, it won't come out even more. CP: Yes, yes. It's humid. How is it over there? DT: It's brilliantly sunny. CP: Oh, really? I see. Where do you live? DT: I'm in the Kanto region. How about you? CP: ""Is it after the typhoon has passed? I'm in Kyushu."" DT: Oh Kyushu! Is it going to rain all day? CP: Yes, it is. It rains intermittently. But when it rains, it's quite strong. DT: I hope it doesn't rain for days. CP: Yes, indeed. Flooding in this area is also a concern. DT: I see. Do you live near the river? CP: Yes. There is a large river nearby. DT: That is concerning. CP: I see. It seems that the levees used to break many times in the past. DT: It's scary. Recently, there have been a lot of flood disasters. CP: The weather is strange, isn't it? There's too much heavy rain. DT: That's true. It's a tropical climate, like Southeast Asia. CP: Really! I wish it would rain little by little regularly. DT: It kind of makes you unsure if the rainy season has ended or not, doesn't it? CP: This year, it didn't rain much during the rainy season. DT: So that's why it's raining now. CP: Ah, maybe! DT: Either way, it seems it's going to rain. CP: ""That's probably true. It's also a problem if it doesn't rain, so there are pros and cons."""
4,"DT: Nice to meet you. CP: Nice to meet you! Looking forward to working with you! DT: What have you been enjoying doing lately? CP: I wonder. Maybe when I'm writing a novel? DT: Eh! Amazing! You write rather than read. CP: No, no, it's just a hobby of mine even though I'm not good at it. DT: I'm not good at writing, so I respect you. CP: Thank you very much! Recently, it seems like many people are writing, and interacting with them is fun too. DT: I see. Do you publish what you write somewhere? CP: ""On the internet and such. I participate in short story contests and enjoy them."" DT: Sounds good. You can enjoy it anywhere if you have a computer. CP: Yes. It's about 5 or 10 pages of manuscript paper, so if I work hard, I feel like I can manage it. DT: From my perspective, it feels like having 5 pieces. CP: I see. Some amazing people write around 500 pieces, you know. DT: Is that true?! That's amazing. Have you liked writing since long ago? CP: No, not at all. A friend started it and invited me to try it, and surprisingly, it was fun. DT: That was the trigger, wasn't it? CP: Yes. My friend writes about 300 pieces and submits them to big competitions. DT: There's something dreamy about it, isn't there? It might catch the eye of a publisher, you know. CP: ""Hey! Writing 300 pages is impossible for me! Authors are amazing, aren't they?"" DT: That's amazing. I wonder how you were raised when you were little. CP: Both my friend and I were ordinary kids, you know. We didn't particularly read books or anything. DT: It's surprising that you can write without reading books much. CP: ""It's surprising, isn't it! But I have always liked picture books, both in the past and now!"" DT: Picture books are cute, aren't they? They make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. CP: ""Yes, right? The drawings are cute and soothing."" DT: I used to like Guri and Gura. CP: I love it! How many times have I thought about trying pancakes! DT: I understand. Those are the ideal pancakes, right? CP: ""Someday, I definitely want to eat it!"""
5,"DT: Hello! CP: Hello! DT: ""Every day, it's a hassle to think about dinner. What do you plan to eat today?"" CP: Today's dish is scheduled to be Mapo eggplant! DT: That's nice! Maybe I should copy it. CP: Eggplants are delicious this time of year, aren't they? DT: I don't buy eggplants very often. Is it their season now? CP: ""My father back home has a vegetable garden, and I got these from there!"" DT: ""That's wonderful. You can eat fresh ones!"" CP: That's right. My parents' home is also nearby, so I'm very grateful to my father. Is your parents' home nearby? DT: I'm jealous that you're close! My place is far. I haven't been back for the past few years. CP: Oh no. It's hard to go back because it's far away and with COVID too. DT: That's right. Many people are getting COVID-19 when they want to go home, and they can't go back. CP: ""I see. Are you going back by Shinkansen or airplane?"" DT: It's the Shinkansen. I'm worried because it doesn't seem like it can be ventilated. CP: That's right. Enclosed spaces are scary. DT: It's unpleasant when there are too many people in the elevator, isn't it? CP: ""Indeed! You want to avoid it as much as possible, right?"" DT: That's right. I hope the pandemic ends soon. CP: I really think so. Do you have video calls with your family? DT: ""Yes, yes. They are happy to see their grandchild."" CP: Oh! Your family must be looking forward to it as well. DT: That's right. They said it might be better not to go back so that the baby doesn't get infected with COVID-19. CP: That's important! Your family must be praying for the end of the pandemic. DT: That's true. I was really planning to go home this summer. I hate COVID-19. CP: ""It's true. They must absolutely want to see you terribly."" DT: That's right. We met once in May, and they've grown even more since then. CP: I hope the coronavirus situation settles down soon. DT: Yes, indeed. Let's hope neither of us gets COVID. CP: ""That's true. Let's be careful!"""
6,"DT: Hello. EM: Hello! DT: What is your hobby? EM: When it comes to tinkering with bikes and cars, is it not something you have much connection with? DT: ""No, I don't. Are you particular about the interior or exterior of the car?"" EM: Not just cars, but I like old things in general and mainly enjoy fixing them up and using them. DT: That is interesting. How old is it? EM: The car was first manufactured in 1962, right? Do you know of something called the Mini Cooper? DT: I know. There are many people who drive Coopers, right? EM: The BMW one is like that. Mine is like a tin toy made by Rover. DT: It's a retro and cute image. EM: That's right. So, we fix any issues that arise quickly and make sure they don't happen again. DT: I am interested in those kinds of things because I like old Fiat cars. EM: Sounds good, I like the Cinque too. It's easy to tinker with, so I'd like to try it out someday. DT: ""It depends on the car whether it is easy to tweak or not."" EM: Unlike a motorcycle, it's tough for amateurs since you can't reach the internal structure and need a crane. DT: I see. Do you drive that Mini Cooper often? EM: Of course. Or rather, that’s the only car we have. DT: I see. Do you go on long trips as well? EM: ""I think I don't do it much. It's Tokyo, but maybe up to around Nagano."" DT: How is the fuel economy? EM: ""It's like sprinkling with a ladle. It's high octane, too."" DT: ""As expected, right? But it feels different when you're riding it, doesn't it?"" EM: Yes. I think it's about 7 kilometers. It's a car I've wanted for a long time, so it's cute. DT: Where can you get such old cars? EM: As for me, it was through an auction, but it often comes up in used car searches. DT: You got it at an auction, right? It looks like it would fetch an amazing price!! EM: Since it was in a decent condition, it should have been exactly 400,000. DT: It's surprising that you can purchase it for that price. EM: Since it's a prerequisite for repairing, it's almost scrap iron!"
7,"DT: Please! EM: Please! DT: What did you eat for lunch today? EM: ""It was quite simple. It's like Kama-tama udon."" DT: I often eat Kamatama udon for lunch. Do you prefer cold or hot udon? EM: If I had to choose, it's rather warm, but good udon should be eaten cold, right? DT: Good udon, huh? When it comes to eating out, I've only ever had Marugame or Hanamaru Udon. EM: Since I prefer home cooking, when I eat out, I tend to look for slightly better places! DT: ""Are there quite a few restaurants with delicious udon?"" EM: It ends up being about travel destinations, but I had delicious food in places like Fukushima and Chichibu! Also, Kagawa! DT: I want to try eating in Kagawa. Is the authentic place really different? EM: The one in Kagawa was insanely delicious! I was surprised. And it was cheap too! DT: ""Wow, I'm curious. It's the soul food of Kagawa Prefecture, isn't it?"" EM: ""Yes. It seemed to be quite famous as a shop operating in a greenhouse."" DT: ""A shop in a greenhouse is unusual."" EM: Yes. So I don't remember the name, but I can talk right away! DT: It looks easy to enter casually, so I'll check it out and go sometime! EM: Sure, sure. As a result of that influence, there are places where they serve kama-tama udon. DT: I see. Do they mix in things like eggs even in the original version? EM: That's right. I only got some croquette or something put on it. DT: ""How nice. Even though I had lunch, I'm starting to want to eat."" EM: I understand. Talking about it makes you want to eat it, doesn't it? DT: That's right! I'm not hungry, but I can eat udon! EM: Indeed. Easy to eat. Maybe I'll have udon again for dinner. DT: ""Sounds good. But at night, it’s not going to be kamatama, right?"" EM: Well, I feel like the only delicious thing I can make at home is something like Kamatama udon. DT: Is that so? Doesn't the warmth depend on the noodle soup base? EM: ""The soup is basically a ready-made product, you know. Oh, shall we make yaki udon instead?"" DT: That's great! I'll imitate it. EM: Let's do that!"
8,"DT: Good evening. Thank you in advance. EN: Good evening! DT: What did you have for dinner today? EN: Today's meal was gratin! DT: ""Looks delicious! Did you make it?"" EN: My wife made it for me. DT: It's the best! EN: I was very satisfied! How about you? DT: This is a bibimbap bento. I just bought it for a quick meal. EN: ""Bibimbap is delicious, isn't it? Is it from Hotto Motto, perhaps?"" DT: No, I bought it at a regular supermarket. EN: ""There is bibimbap at the supermarket!"" DT: ""I found it! It was on sale, so I ended up buying it. I'll copy your gratin tomorrow."" EN: Sounds good! It might be cheaper after 8 PM. Definitely try the gratin! DT: Does your wife cook every day? EN: ""You made it for me. I'm so grateful."" DT: That's lovely. I should learn from you. EN: Do you cook? DT: ""I do it, but every day is impossible."" EN: Is it only on weekends, or something like that? DT: No, I cook on weekdays too, but when I'm tired, I buy food. Do you sometimes cook? EN: I try to help out on weekends. DT: That's wonderful. I think it would be helpful if you could assist me. EN: Leaving everything to others is not good, you know. I'm not good at cooking, though. DT: Yes, it is. It would be better to participate a little if you can. Your wife must be having a hard time too. EN: Living with someone has a lot of difficult aspects, too. DT: Yes, that's right. Consideration is important. EN: That's right! It's easy to forget, so I want to live with that in mind. DT: I think it's totally fine if you just help out on weekends! EN: That's right!"
9,"DT: Please. EN: Good evening! DT: What do you enjoy doing these days? EN: ""When I'm reading manga, right?"" DT: What are you reading? EN: Do you know about Yotsuba&! ? DT: I don't know. I only read manga from Jump. EN: I see! What do you like in Jump? DT: ""Hmm, it’s not recent, but I like works by Mr. Togashi. Also, I read One Piece."" EN: ""Hunter x Hunter, right? I love it too."" DT: That's right! But I read up to a certain point and haven't read the rest. EN: The new work is on hold as well. Please take your time reading up to the latest! DT: I see. The conversation came to a pause and I stopped reading after that. One Piece too. EN: ""When it's long, it happens, doesn't it? One Piece is over 100 volumes. It's understandable."" DT: ""It's too long, right? I stopped around volume 55."" EN: ""Halfway through. Have you watched the latest One Piece movie?"" DT: ""I haven't seen it. Did you watch it?"" EN: Actually, I'm going to see it tomorrow! DT: I see. I haven't watched much anime. Do you watch both anime and read manga? EN: ""You're watching it, huh? But I like Hunter x Hunter more!"" DT: That's amazing. I'm looking forward to the movie!! EN: I wanted to watch it as soon as possible because I'm afraid of spoilers. DT: ""Can I see the movie's content in the manga, or is it a spoiler on the internet?"" EN: ""I can hear people talking about it in family restaurants and such! I thought, as expected of One Piece."" DT: ""Is it from there? That was unexpected!!"" EN: It's okay to post spoilers officially. Even more terrifying. DT: ""Wow! I'd really like you to stop that."" EN: Given how popular it is, it might be unavoidable. DT: The official stance is not to say no, on the contrary. EN: It's strange, isn't it?"
10,"DT: Please. EN: Good evening! DT: What food do you dislike? EN: It's chawanmushi. DT: Why is that? EN: Doesn't the smell have a unique scent? I can't handle that. DT: I never thought of that. You're the first person I've met who dislikes chawanmushi! EN: ""Seriously? There are people like this too."" DT: ""Certainly, because various ingredients are in there. Maybe that's why it has a unique taste."" EN: I like things like ginkgo nuts and shiitake mushrooms on their own. DT: I see. That's interesting!! EN: I also dislike egg tofu. DT: I see. Do you dislike even just seeing conveyor belt sushi? EN: It's sad to see it being eaten right in front of me. DT: ""Do you feel sad? But there's nothing we can do about it, right?"" EN: How about things you dislike? DT: I don't like mackerel. EN: Oh! Why is that? DT: I've thrown up during morning sickness. I was able to eat deliciously while eating, though. EN: I see! It sounds a bit traumatic. DT: Yes! That fishy smell is the worst. EN: That's inevitable. Are the other fish okay? DT: It's okay! As long as it doesn't smell fishy. EN: Is sashimi okay with you? DT: It's okay!! How about you and fish? EN: I love sashimi. I often end up buying it at the supermarket. DT: ""It's delicious, isn't it? I want to eat something fresh!"" EN: If it's along the coast, there are some, right? I want to try the ones from Hokkaido. DT: It must be absolutely delicious. Somehow, I'm getting hungry. EN: Same here!"
11,"DT: Good evening. Please. DY: Good evening, nice to meet you. DT: What did you eat for dinner today? DY: Today I ate yaki udon! DT: It looks delicious. Do you often make yaki udon? DY: Yes, it's easy to make, so I often cook it! What did you eat? DT: I ate saury and negitoro bowl. DY: ""Pacific saury, huh! It feels like autumn already!"" DT: That's right. Speaking of which, the package did say ""new product."" DY: Sounds good! By the way, it’s already September starting today. DT: It's fast, isn't it!!! DY: It's early! It still feels a bit hot though. I hope it gets cooler. DT: ""It's still quite hot, isn't it? But the sun is setting a little earlier now."" DY: Indeed, that might be true! Did you do anything summery this summer? DT: I have been to the pool only once. DY: ""The pool is nice! Is it a big pool?"" DT: No, it's a pool attached to the sports gym. DY: I see! But the pool is nice! I haven't been to the pool this year. DT: Actually, it wasn't very fun. DY: ""Huh, what happened?"" DT: A 6-month-old baby can join baby swimming, but it was too early for our child. They seemed uncomfortable the entire time. DY: I see, that must have been a bit tough. Is the bath at your house okay? DT: Yes, that's right. I'm in a pretty good mood. So I misunderstood. DY: I see, that was unfortunate. DT: Yes, I was looking forward to it, so it was especially disappointing. DY: When a little more time has passed, let's definitely try again. DT: Yes, it seems it will still be a while. It was completely my parents' ego. DY: ""It's difficult, isn't it? I don't have children yet, but it seems tough."" DT: It's tough, but it's cute! DY: Certainly, if it's cute, it might be forgiven!"
12,"DT: Good evening! DY: Good evening, I look forward to working with you. DT: Did anything interesting happen this summer? DY: Sure, it was really fun to visit Ishigaki Island! DT: Oh! Was the sea clear? DY: The sea was incredibly beautiful! There were lots of fish even within the swimming area! DT: I'm envious. I want to go snorkeling. DY: I went snorkeling and it was amazing! Haven't you been to the sea recently? DT: I haven't been there since the coronavirus. Do you transfer planes to Ishigaki Island? DY: I see. Ishigaki Island had a direct flight from Haneda! DT: ""There are direct flights, right? I've never been to Okinawa and I'm interested. Do you feel like you want to go again?"" DY: I want to go to the remote islands of Okinawa again! Although I just went, it was so good that I want to go again soon. DT: Oh, really! I'm also curious about Miyako Island. DY: Miyakojima is nice too, isn't it? If I go next time, I'm thinking of going to Miyakojima as well. DT: Since I only know the classic route, I could only think of Miyakojima. Did you enjoy any other marine sports or anything? DY: Marine sports included snorkeling and then kayaking to watch the sunset. DT: Ahh, I'm so jealous! DY: It was really good. I also saw the starry sky, and it was incredibly beautiful! DT: It looks like you can see it in complete darkness without anything else blocking it. DY: Yes, it was really pitch dark around, and thanks to that, I saw a starry sky more beautiful than I had ever seen. DT: The sound of the waves and the starry sky. How lovely. It’s an unforgettable memory. DY: Yes, it's unforgettable. I'm currently experiencing Ishigaki Island loss. DT: Ah, is your heart still in Ishigaki Island? DY: Yes, I just got back about a week ago, but my heart is still in Ishigaki Island! DT: Did you buy a lot of souvenirs? DY: Yes, I bought it. I also painted the Shisa, so it's displayed at the entrance. DT: That's nice. It looks like it would make a good talisman! By the way, what is the meaning of placing a Shisa again? DY: I think it was a talisman to ward off evil spirits, but I'm not really sure! DT: I see. It's nice that it has a Shisa flavor. DY: Yes, since they are unique items that we painted ourselves, they have extra charm and are great!"
