1,"CC: Nice to meet you! AY: Nice to meet you! CC: Did you participate in any summer-like events? AY: The only thing that felt like summer was eating ice cream! How about you? CC: I see. I went to the local festival which was revived for the first time in three years. AY: Oh! How was it? CC: The fireworks were beautiful. AY: ""There were fireworks!"" CC: I thought all the festivals had resumed, but it seems there are still some that can't take place yet. AY: I see. It might not be the case for us yet. CC: I see. AY: Yes. Did you do things like goldfish scooping? CC: I didn't do it, lol. AY: Well then, did you eat anything? CC: That's right. We watched fireworks while eating fried chicken. AY: Oh! Summer! That feeling is wonderful! CC: I'm satisfied that I could also drink beer. AY: ""Beer, huh! Can you drink quite a lot?"" CC: It's about average. How about you? AY: I'm not good with beer. CC: Oh, I see. Are you not good with alcohol in general? AY: I like sweet things! CC: So you drink cocktails, huh! AY: That's right! Like Horoyoi. CC: I see. Do you also drink alone? AY: Mostly with friends and family. CC: I also only drink alcohol when I am with someone else. AY: I see! It sounds like a lot of fun. CC: Isn't it! AY: Please tell me more again."
2,"CC: Nice to meet you! AY: Yes. Likewise! CC: What do you usually do when you have time? AY: Hmm. Maybe the TV or a game. CC: Are you more of an indoor person? AY: ""I'm a hardcore indoor person!"" CC: ""I'm also a hardcore indoor person!"" AY: ""It's hot outside, it's impossible!"" CC: Certainly. What kind of TV programs do you watch? AY: Recently, there are a lot of dramas, aren't there? CC: ""My favorite is the magical renovation. As for the drama."" AY: Ah! That is interesting! I am watching it too. CC: ""I wasn't expecting much, but it was surprisingly interesting."" AY: That's right. It's easy to watch and enjoyable. CC: The uncles are cute, aren't they? AY: Hahaha! Yeah, yeah! It has quite a good flavor, and it might be stealing the spotlight. CC: What other dramas are you watching? AY: This season, I'm watching Old Rookie. CC: Oh, I'm watching it too. AY: ""A drama that is educational in various ways!"" CC: ""That's right! Since I'm not familiar with sports, this is a good learning experience."" AY: Yes. And the main character is cute! CC: Ayano Go can do both cute and cool roles, which is amazing. AY: ""That's right. He plays the wimp role perfectly, too!"" CC: Also, I thought having such a nice wife was enviable. AY: ""Your wife is too perfect!"" CC: Is there really someone as bright and kind as that? AY: Hey! And it seems like you can make some money too. CC: I also want to marry Kanako-chan. AY: ""If I were a man, I'd want to marry you!"""
3,"CC: Nice to meet you! DP: Thank you in advance. CC: ""I was wondering what you do when you have time, but I guess you don't have any time, right? Haha"" DP: Since I am on a solo assignment, I have time on weekdays. CC: I see. Will you spend your time watching videos? DP: It's always just that. Thank goodness for YOUTUBE and AMAZON PRIME VIDEO. CC: I feel the same way. DP: What kind of things are you watching? CC: On YouTube, well, it's called Rehack. It's a bit embarrassing to say it, though. DP: What! What is that? Please tell me! CC: Maybe it's related to politics. It's a program made by Nikkei TV Tokyo. DP: ""You're not embarrassed at all, are you? That's impressive. Is it a debate-related thing?"" CC: No, it's embarrassing to say it since Hiroyuki is here, haha. DP: Hiroyuki appears everywhere. But he is often a topic of conversation in our family. My eldest son looks up to him as a mentor. CC: ""It's scary to look up to a master, haha."" DP: A cause for concern. CC: It is a program that makes you feel like you understand a bit more about society. DP: I'll watch it from now on. I'm looking forward to it. CC: If there is an opportunity, definitely. I watch anime on Amazon Prime. How about you? DP: I was watching JOJO until just now. CC: JOJO! I haven't been following it. Is it the latest series? DP: No, it's an old one. It takes a lot of effort to watch that. What anime are you watching? CC: Since it was a hot topic, I recently binge-watched Ya Boy Kongming. DP: I'm curious about it. Is it interesting? CC: You can watch it with an empty mind, so it feels good. It's silly and funny. DP: Yes, yes. I want to clear my mind. CC: If so, please laugh. You can laugh at how silly it is. DP: Alright, let's watch!! CC: Please watch the cute Koumei! DP: Roger. It was fun. Thank you very much. CC: Thank you very much!"
4,"CC: Nice to meet you! BL: Nice to meet you. CC: Did you do anything that feels like summer? BL: It's about playing with water in the bath. CC: ""That's nice. Do you have children?"" BL: ""That's right. I thought it might improve her mood, so I put her in a swimsuit."" CC: After all, I guess we can't go to the sea or the pool, right? BL: It seems that we can go this year, but the pool is apparently scary. CC: Oh, is that so? Are you afraid of the pool regardless of the coronavirus? BL: Due to the impact of COVID-19, I have never been to a pool. CC: I see, that does indeed feel scary. BL: You have to get used to it while you're young. Actually, I can't swim either. CC: I wasn't good at it either. But after walking along the beach for the first time in a while, I felt like swimming. BL: I think it's amazing if you can swim in the sea! CC: But whether I can swim now is a mystery... BL: If you were able to swim before, I feel like it should be fine, but what do you think? CC: ""I don't think I'll die, haha. I haven't had the opportunity to swim since becoming an adult."" BL: ""It's quite rare, isn't it? Even if you go to the sea, you'll probably just play on the beach."" CC: That's right. I might not have ridden a bicycle for about 10 years. BL: ""10 years is a long time! When I rode it after a few years, I could ride it normally."" CC: I think I can ride it, but we are supposed to ride on the road, aren't we? That's what makes me nervous. BL: Certainly. It is scary where there are many cars. CC: I feel scared when I see a bicycle riding on the roadway, and I also feel scared when I see a bicycle riding on the sidewalk. BL: On sidewalks where bicycles and pedestrians are separated, it might be safer. CC: Yes, yes, that's fine. BL: ""It would be more reassuring if there were more separated sidewalks."" CC: When I got off at Kawasaki Station, I was amazed at the considerable number of sections for bicycles. BL: I see. There are places that are more advanced depending on the region. CC: I think so. BL: I hope more places will be improved."
5,"CC: Nice to meet you. BL: Nice to meet you. CC: What do you usually do when you have free time? BL: When I have a little free time, I check social media. CC: ""Is it something like Instagram?"" BL: ""Mainly on Twitter."" CC: ""Twitter? I also look at it occasionally."" BL: Even though I want to see my acquaintances' tweets, I often end up seeing recommended ones. CC: Don't you think Twitter's recommendation feature is too frequent? BL: I think there are many. Related things might be coming up, but they are all from people I don't know at all. CC: I see a lot of tweets from people I'm not following, lol. BL: That's right. Usually complaints come in. CC: I only check Twitter occasionally, so when I do, there are a lot of updates piled up. BL: There are many people who update frequently, aren't there? CC: That's right. But I spend more time looking at Instagram. Don't you look at Instagram? BL: I rarely check Instagram, to the point where I have to log in again when I do. CC: I finally installed TikTok the other day. BL: Oh! I have the impression that there's a lot of dancing. CC: I was too young to understand the vibe! Lol. BL: As I thought, that's the case. It probably doesn't suit me either. CC: I like dancing, so I thought it might be good, but it was just okay. BL: Have you ever done dancing? CC: ""Ah, just a little bit when I was a student!"" BL: Dance changes with the times, doesn't it? I'm not sure if modern dance can even be called dance. Haha. CC: I thought Chocopla, who is also active on TikTok, is a genius. BL: Is he a famous person? CC: Do you know the comedians called Chocolate Planet? The topic has shifted from dancing though. BL: Ah, you're an entertainer! It sounds interesting to see things other than dance. CC: In a TikTok filled with incomprehensible posts, I was impressed because this one was exceptionally nonsensical. Chocopla. BL: It seems interesting to go all out! CC: It was fun talking with you! Thank you very much. BL: I also had fun. Thank you as well."
6,"CC: Nice to meet you! BR: Thank you in advance. CC: ""It is my pleasure. Do you do any exercise?"" BR: Recently, I haven't been doing much. Just walking and doing sit-ups. CC: Great. Did you go for walks frequently? BR: That's right. Before it got hot, I used to walk for more than an hour a day. CC: You walk quite a bit, don't you? Does it not really matter unless you walk for an hour? BR: It seems so. It appears that the effect finally starts to show after about 20 minutes. CC: Oh, really? BR: Do you do any exercise? CC: I don't do it at all, but I think it would feel nice to take a walk along the river near my house. BR: The river is close, isn't it? Ours is also close, so we often go there. It feels nice! CC: Recently, the heat is one thing, but the strong wind is also a bit scary. BR: Is the wind strong? Is the river quite wide? CC: I think it's spacious. Also, the sea is relatively close. BR: It seems like the wind is strong. I think our place is more on the mountain side, so it's not that wide. CC: ""Then, is the current swift?"" BR: No. It's not that much. They are quite calm, so it's soothing to watch them. CC: ""That's nice. You can watch water flowing forever, can't you?"" BR: That's right. I like standing and watching from the bridge. CC: My eyes have been flickering a lot lately. Haha. BR: Certainly. On days when the sun is strong, it's impossible. It's tough on the bridge because there's no shade. CC: The wind on the bridge is also really strong, isn't it? BR: That sounds amazing! It's not that much here, so it's alright. CC: I see. On windy days, the bridge sways. BR: ""Really? That's scary... It's amazing how different it is upstream and downstream!"" CC: Yes! I would like to go on an adventure from the uppermost stream of the river to the sea at least once. BR: River rafting! That sounds fun! CC: I remember seeing an advertisement for that kind of experience before. I'm interested. BR: ""Oh, such a thing exists?! Thank you for letting me know!"""
7,"CC: Good evening! CH: Good evening, nice to meet you. CC: Nice to meet you. Did you go out somewhere today? CH: Today, I only went for a walk after dinner, and I haven't particularly gone out otherwise. CC: Oh, you went for a walk! Do you walk frequently? CH: If it doesn't rain, I walk every day, but in the past two weeks, there has been a lot of rain and I haven't been able to walk. CC: Amazing. Every day? The rain finally stopped, didn't it? CH: That's right. The temperature in the mornings and evenings has started to drop. CC: Indeed. It was cool this morning too. CH: It gets hot quickly, but a little while ago it was even hot early in the morning. CC: Sure. ""Shall we walk for about an hour?"" CH: It's about just one hour. I determine it based on distance, and it's roughly a distance that takes an hour. CC: It's amazing that you can keep it up every day. Was there any particular reason or motivation that made you think you had to exercise? CH: I used to exercise quite a lot, but after being sick, I lost the motivation, so at least I'm trying to walk. CC: I see. You must have had physical strength to begin with. CH: Looking back, I think I was energetic. For example, if I came home at midnight, I would run until 1 AM. CC: From midnight! That's too energetic. What time did you go to work? CH: I generally arrived at work around 8:30. It was not often that I stayed late. CC: You have incredible stamina. Just work alone leaves me exhausted. Normally. CH: Being young was also a factor, but as expected, things can easily fall apart with some kind of trigger, can't they? CC: After moving that much, you'll be able to sleep soundly. CH: That's right. However, even quite a while before I got sick, I had been experiencing sleep paralysis more frequently. CC: Is that so? What causes sleep paralysis? CH: Stress and overwork are often talked about. CC: Is that so? But from what I heard, you're overworking. CH: Looking back, you realize that it was overdoing it or a sign, don't you? CC: There are things you only understand after they've passed, aren't there? CH: In any case, I want to be careful in the future so that I can get a good night's sleep. CC: That's right! CH: Thank you very much."
8,"CC: Good evening! CH: Good evening. Nice to meet you. CC: Are you not sleepy yet at this time of day? CH: It depends on the day, but I think it's usually around the time when I start to feel sleepy. CC: Do you usually go to bed around midnight? CH: I see. It's often around midnight. How about you? CC: I think it will be a little later. Around 1 or 2 o'clock. CH: I see. Don’t you feel sleepy the next morning if it’s around 2 o’clock? CC: I'm not working right now, so it's fine. When I am working, I want to be asleep by 1 o'clock. CH: I see. I understand that going to bed early and waking up early is good, but there is a large individual difference in sleep, isn't there? CC: It seems that being a morning person or a night person may also be influenced by genetics. CH: I see. So there are people who have genes that make them better at night. CC: Matsuko Deluxe said, ""I'm completely a night owl."" CH: Well, it's not surprising at all. CC: If you were a morning person, I'd be surprised. CH: ""Right. Some people are okay with shorter sleep durations, while others need longer sleep."" CC: I feel that about seven hours is just right for me. How about you? CH: I think I'm the type who should sleep for 8 hours. Whether I actually sleep that much is another matter. CC: ""Sleeping for 10 hours is too much, right?"" CH: I see. After becoming an adult, it doesn't seem like 10 hours are particularly necessary. CC: If I sleep for 10 hours, I can't wake up anymore. CH: I lived in the countryside, so I slept a lot when I was little. CC: ""Do you sleep a lot in the countryside? lol"" CH: Well, it depends on the person, but that's generally the trend. CC: I see. I didn't really have that kind of image. CH: There were also those times, but we don't have a way to play after it gets dark. CC: I see! Don't you go to friends' houses either? CH: ""They were all children who went home at 5 o'clock."" CC: ""That was quick. But it's true, rural nights are really dark."" CH: For children in their growth period, it was healthy."
9,"CC: Hello, nice to meet you! BV: Nice to meet you. CC: What do you do on your days off from work? BV: Lately, I've been exclusively tidying up the house. CC: I see. Did you get it all sorted out? BV: That's quite difficult. It gets messy right away. CC: ""Even though I'm tidying up, it gets messy, doesn't it? But, I understand."" BV: When I have work, I can't be bothered with that. CC: That's right. In my case, even if I clean up over the weekend, it rebounds by the next weekend. BV: I understand. I want to become good at tidying up. CC: Hehe. Do you have a fixed day off? BV: I usually have Sundays off. CC: ""The others are basically work?"" BV: I see. CC: It's tough. But if you could have a break even just on Sundays, you might be able to meet your friends. BV: Yes, I played with my friends last Sunday. CC: In the past, when I had a job where I had to work on weekends and holidays, I couldn't meet anyone. BV: That is indeed difficult to coordinate a break. CC: That's right. BV: ""Are you in the service industry or something?"" CC: At that time, yes. Because it was work aimed at individual customers, weekends and holidays were crucial. BV: Ah, I see. CC: Well, having weekdays off is convenient because you can go to the bank or other stores when they are not crowded. BV: Having weekdays off is nice, isn't it? CC: I would be happy with one day off during the weekdays and one day off on either Saturday or Sunday. BV: I understand! Privacy is important, isn't it? CC: I don't have that many friends, but if I'm put in a situation where I can't see anyone at all, it gets quite exhausting. BV: You want to take a break, don't you? CC: Taking a break is important! BV: Let's take it easy. See you."
10,"CC: Nice to meet you! BH: Nice to meet you. CC: Thank you in advance. BH: Thank you in advance. CC: It's rainy today. The thunder was intense until just a while ago. BH: Is that so? It hasn't rained here yet. CC: Oh, really? BH: Where is it? CC: It's the Chubu region! BH: I see. Thunder is scary. CC: Yesterday was extremely hot... BH: It's been especially hot lately, hasn't it? CC: It is. BH: When it's this hot, I end up eating too many cold things. CC: ""Is it like ice cream?"" BH: Ice cream and juice, for example. CC: ""Certainly, that's true. But when you sweat a lot and then go into a place where the air conditioning is blasting, it feels extremely cold."" BH: Certainly, air conditioners get really cold, don't they? CC: That's right. The company I used to work for was hot in the winter and cold in the summer. BH: That's terrible!! CC: That's right. So it was difficult to regulate my body temperature. BH: ""That's right. Even with the temperature set to 28 degrees, it gets really cold and it's troublesome."" CC: But when it's set to 27 degrees, it feels hot. BH: I understand. It's difficult, isn't it? CC: 27.5 degrees might be good. BH: It might really be so. But it's unfortunate that it's not there. CC: But today the temperature is just right. BH: I've been at home all this time, so it might be a little cold. CC: Is that so? I also spend a lot of time indoors. BH: When you stay indoors all the time, you lose track of the outside temperature, and it's tough when you eventually go out, isn't it?"
11,"CC: Nice to meet you. BH: Nice to meet you! CC: What do you usually do when you have free time? BH: I often watch recorded dramas and variety shows. CC: Oh, you watch TV! BH: I'm a TV addict!! CC: I see. What kind of dramas are you watching now? BH: ""The one I like now is called Ishiko and Haneo!"" CC: I'm watching too! BH: ""It's interesting, isn't it?"" CC: It's interesting. Oh, was it broadcast today? BH: What day was it again? I don't remember because I watch it on recording. CC: Wrong. It's tomorrow. BH: I see. CC: It seems like it was on Friday. BH: I see. I can't wait to see the next one! CC: ""I found the magical renovation unexpectedly interesting. Among the dramas this season."" BH: I like that too! I’m looking at it thinking, wow, it’s this expensive! CC: ""That's expensive! Indeed."" BH: There's just no way I can do it. CC: ""I didn't have high expectations, but when I watched it, it was surprisingly interesting."" BH: I quite like many of Haru's dramas! CC: Indeed. Haru-chan's dramas often hit the mark. BH: I liked the one you were in with Matsushita before! I don't remember the title, though. CC: ""Haruchan is appearing a lot."" BH: Right. The lead actor is also in many other works, isn't he? CC: Was it Shotaro Mamiya? BH: Yes, yes. Recently, I can't remember names. CC: I like Shota Mamiya's slightly goofy roles. BH: I like it too!"
12,"CC: Hello! BH: Hello. CC: Do you usually listen to music often? BH: I often listen! While doing housework and such. CC: Music is great because you can listen to it while doing other things. BH: I see. CC: I am chatting while playing music even now. BH: ""I see. That's nice. I am in silence."" CC: Since I started working from home, I've been playing music all the time. BH: What kind of music do you listen to? CC: ""Hmm, there might be a bit too much Western music. For Japanese music, maybe Kenshi Yonezu?"" BH: I like Yonezu! I don't listen to much Western music. CC: Everyone loves Mr. Yonezu. BH: Right. CC: How can they create such good music so quickly? BH: That's really true. It feels just like a god! CC: It's talent. BH: You are loved by music, aren't you? CC: Not only do I write lyrics and compose music, but I also sing and dance. BH: ""The dancing skill was honestly surprising!"" CC: I even make videos. BH: People who can do anything can do it, right? CC: Hey, I wonder what can't be done. BH: You're quite good at talking too, aren't you? I wonder if there's anything you're not good at? CC: Oh, I see. I've never seen you talking! BH: Is that so? CC: ""Are you on TV or anything, Mr. Yonezu?"" BH: Well, it hasn't really appeared much, has it? I've only seen it a little myself. CC: ""I will try to find Yonezu-san talking."" BH: Please enjoy!"
