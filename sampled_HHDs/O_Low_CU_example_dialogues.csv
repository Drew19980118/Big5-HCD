1,"CU: Thank you in advance! CA: Thank you in advance! CU: Have you decided on your lunch for today? CA: ""I'm still undecided. I'm thinking about what to choose. Have you decided, <CU>?"" CU: Today, my husband and child have gone fishing, so it seems like they will bring back McDonald's on their way home, haha. CA: McDonald's is great! Did you have any specific requests among their menu? CU: I always end up choosing the teriyaki burger. CA: Ah! It's delicious, isn't it!! I'm starting to want to eat it. CU: ""It's a limited-time item, but actually my favorite is the Chicken Tatsuta!"" CA: Chicken Tatsuta! That's the one they used to advertise in Touch's commercials! CU: That's right! Have you ever eaten it? CA: Actually, I haven't eaten it yet. Is this sold regularly every year like the Tsukimi Burger? CU: For now, I feel like it's being sold once a year! CA: Wow!! I'll try to eat it next time!! CU: I think it was always around spring. The buns are fluffy and delicious, so definitely try them! CA: The buns are different too! I'm looking forward to next spring!! CU: What kind of fast food do you like, <CA>? CA: I quite like the Twister from KFC, and I occasionally buy it as a treat. CU: I know! It's delicious, isn't it? That thing that looks like naan is tasty. CA: That's right! The texture of the dough is indescribable! I love KFC too, but I also love this. CU: I also like Japanese-style cutlet sandwiches. I guess I really like the sweet and savory taste, haha. CA: Ah! There it is! It really is sweet and spicy! There are definitely flavors you prefer, right? CU: Sure. How about having fast food today as well? (laughs) CA: Talking about it made me want to go buy some! Should I go to McDonald's or KFC? CU: Let's do that. It's Obon, and it's nice to take it easy. CA: I will consider it as having a meal together with our ancestors. CU: Indeed. Our ancestors might also be pleased with the rare food. CA: ""Hehehe. That would be nice. By the way, there were also people who liked Twister. Maybe I'll go buy it."" CU: I see. The weather looks bad, but please be careful and take care. CA: Thank you very much. Let's talk again!"
2,"CU: Hello! CA: Hello! CU: Recently, there's been a lot of strange weather, it's scary, isn't it? CA: Really. Even though the rainy season has ended, it's been nothing but rain, and it also pours heavily, doesn't it? CU: There are damages in various places, you know. Was your place okay? CA: I am fine, thanks. How about you, <CU>? CU: I was also fortunately okay. But it's scary to think about what would happen if water came here. CA: Really. It gives me the chills when I watch TV. Do you usually take any disaster prevention measures, not just for rain? CU: ""I have prepared an emergency evacuation bag."" CA: It's prepared, isn't it! CU: Yes, sort of. But since I don't regularly review the contents, it's no good. CA: ""Just having it makes a big difference! I need to prepare something that can be taken out too."" CU: At my house, we just put things like flashlights, portable toilets, water, and non-perishable food in a regular backpack. CA: A portable toilet will be necessary, right? If we can't flush water. CU: ""Yes. If there is a water outage, it would be very inconvenient. It's really scary to imagine."" CA: I used it without thinking, but I realized I should be prepared. CU: That's right. It seems like it's better to always keep water in the bathtub as well. CA: ""There are various things you can devise, I'd like to start with those kinds of things."" CU: I thought I would also review various things! CA: As for the measures we are taking now, it is just stocking canned food, but what kind of canned food do you like, <CU>? CU: ""The most convenient thing to use is probably canned mackerel."" CA: Saba can! It's nutritious, isn't it? CU: That's right. And then there's the usual things like corn and tuna. CA: Yeah, yeah. It's really great that both fish and vegetables can be preserved in cans. CU: That's right. But the best thing is not having the opportunity to use emergency supplies! CA: Really! If you are prepared, you have no worries, so I want to keep it as a charm. CU: That's right. It seems like abnormal weather will continue to occur! CA: Praying for safety and taking measures, right? CU: Yes, let's both do our best to stay prepared. CA: Let's talk again!"
3,"CU: Hello! ED: Hello! CU: This summer was really hot, wasn't it! ED: Really! It was indeed exhausting, wasn't it? CU: I went to an outdoor music festival last weekend and ended up with heatstroke. ED: What! Are you okay? CU: After being in a place without shade for about five hours, I was struck by a headache and nausea. ED: That must have been tough. CU: Yes, I went to the infirmary by myself and felt better after resting for a while. ED: I'm glad you recovered! Was it during the daytime? CU: Yes, it was an event from morning until night, and I got tired during the day. ED: I see. With the enthusiasm of the venue as well, it must have been hot. CU: Yes, it was such a crowd that you could forget about COVID-19. Did you go somewhere? ED: At the end of July, I went to Karuizawa! CU: Karuizawa? I've never been there, so I'm jealous! Is it really a nice place? ED: I had an image of a summer resort, but it wasn't cool at all. It was over 30 degrees. CU: Even Karuizawa is hot as expected, isn't it? How did you spend your time? ED: There was my younger brother's wedding! CU: I see! Congratulations. By the way, at which venue? ED: Thank you very much! It was at the Stone Church of Hoshino Resorts. CU: I know! It's a very beautiful chapel, isn't it! ED: Did you know? Yes, it was very wonderful! CU: Since I was working in the bridal industry, the food must have been delicious. ED: Yes, it was really delicious! It was enjoyable because I rarely go to Hoshino Resort without occasions like this! CU: ""That's right. I'm really jealous. I want to go there someday."" ED: It was hotter than I expected, but it was a lovely place full of nature. CU: Since I live in the Kansai region, it's really difficult for me to go to Karuizawa. ED: I'm also from Kansai! It's convenient to access from Tokyo, right? CU: So you're in Kansai! It's easy to get there from Tokyo, I'm jealous. ED: Yes. So, I leisurely made my way through Nagoya!"
4,"CU: Thank you in advance. ED: Please! CU: Recently, do you have any hobbies or things you are into? ED: I'm into jigsaw puzzles! CU: Wow! Are you working on something quite big? ED: Since it is 1000 pieces, it is not that big. CU: It looks like fun. It seems like you might lose track of time doing it. ED: That's right. When I get absorbed, I really forget to eat. CU: Do you have a lot of works at home? ED: ""There are quite a few. Since it was endless, I stopped displaying the finished products halfway through."" CU: I always wonder what to do with a jigsaw puzzle once it's completed. ED: ""Do you do jigsaw puzzles?"" CU: It feels like a few times in the past. ED: I see! Indeed, it’s something to worry about after it’s completed. Recently, I’ve been breaking it down again and putting it on the shelf. CU: I see. Isn't it more of a waste to ruin a difficult piece of work? ED: ""What a waste! I'll only display the ones I say 'This is it!'"" CU: ""That's right. I feel like doing it for the first time in a while!"" ED: It's nice to do that kind of work in an air-conditioned room, isn't it? CU: I see! I think it's a good hobby! ED: Thank you very much. Have you been into anything recently? CU: I've recently been into K-pop groups. ED: Oh! Is it something like BTS? CU: ""I like BTS, and my favorite right now is their brother group called TXT."" ED: ""That's a thing, huh. I'm not very familiar with it, but a friend of mine loves it. It's really popular!"" CU: It's trending! There are so many videos on YouTube that I lose track of time watching them. ED: Somehow, there are even K-pop dance schools now. CU: Yes, there are! It seems like the neighbor's children are also attending. ED: An acquaintance's child also goes there. They dance with sharp precision. CU: That's amazing! You have a bright future! ED: I'm really looking forward to it! I hope you do your best!"
5,"CU: Good evening! ED: Good evening! CU: Do you have any pets? ED: ""I'm not keeping one! Are you?"" CU: Yes, I have one dog. ED: ""Nice! What kind of dog is it?"" CU: Do you know the dog breed called Cavalier? ED: ""I haven't heard of it. Is it a rare breed?"" CU: ""There may be few. It's a small to medium-sized dog with floppy ears."" ED: I just looked it up! Is it one of the dogs from 101 Dalmatians? CU: That might be true. It's a gentle and cute breed, but it's tough because they shed. ED: ""Those floppy ears are so cute. It certainly looks like it has a lot of fur. How old is it?"" CU: I am 6 years old. I'm almost at the age of being called an aunt. ED: So you're a grandma at 6 years old! But dogs are nice, aren't they? I'd like to have one someday. CU: What kind of dog do you like? ED: ""I like the bigger ones. And also, Shiba Inu!"" CU: I also love big dogs! But I gave up on actually keeping one because it's difficult. ED: My cousin's family had a Siberian Husky before, and it was super cute! CU: Huskies are cute, aren't they? They are friendly, right? ED: Yes! Even though it looks a bit like a wolf, it became very affectionate! CU: That gap is nice, isn't it? ED: That's right! However, the shedding in summer was tremendous. CU: Ah, we also have that problem. For us, July is the peak and it's tough. ED: I think it was about that. It must have been tough, but I think it was probably hot. CU: The Roomba's dustbin gets full quickly. ED: But, pets are soothing, aren't they? CU: Yes, it's simply soothing. I hope you can have one someday. ED: That's right! I'll be away from home for a long time due to work, so that's a concern. CU: Ah, that's a tough problem. ED: That's right. It's also a concern to leave them somewhere."
6,"CU: Hello! DN: Hello. I look forward to working with you. CU: Today was another hot and humid day. DN: Yes. It is clear and very hot here. CU: Were you out somewhere? DN: I was out for work all day today. CU: Good job. Is your work indoors? DN: Yes. Therefore, it is comfortable to stay in an air-conditioned room during the day. CU: Me too. Therefore, it's very difficult for me to cope with this heat. DN: Are you going out early in the morning? CU: No, leaving at 8 o'clock is rather leisurely. DN: Even so, it's cooler than going out at 9 or 10 o'clock, right? CU: Yes, that's right. I went to an outdoor festival last week and, as expected, I got heatstroke. DN: Is that so? What kind of festival was it? CU: It's a music festival called Summer Sonic. Do you know it? DN: No. Is ""Summer Sonic"" the name of an artist? CU: No, it's the name of an event. Many famous artists participated. DN: I see. I'm sorry, I didn't know much about it. For example, what kind of artists are you talking about? CU: Do you know Yuri or Motohiro Hata? DN: No. I'm not familiar with the music everyone knows well. But it sounds fun. CU: Yes, it was fun. But it was too hot. DN: ""Are you possibly going to participate wearing a mask?"" CU: That's right. Since it was outdoors, it wasn't too strict, but we did what we could. DN: ""It's too hot, isn't it? It's not a dome even outdoors, right?"" CU: Yes, it was under the blazing sun. Umbrellas were prohibited, so I could only rely on my hat. DN: That's impossible. If you don't prepare a really sturdy hat, it will fall over. CU: That's right. There were actually people who collapsed. This year is abnormal, isn't it? DN: Yes. Do you listen to the performance while standing all the time? CU: I only watch when the artists I want to see are performing. If you have the chance, please go and see it. DN: Yes. That's a relief. I'll look for it!"
7,"CU: Hello! DN: Hello. Nice to meet you. CU: Have you traveled anywhere recently? DN: I haven't traveled, but I often go to the Kansai region on weekends. CU: Is that so! I live in the Kansai region, but where did you go? DN: I see! I'm happy. I often go to Nishinomiya on weekends. CU: ""Is it Nishinomiya! Do you have any specific places in mind?"" DN: I'm going to study music and visit my university student son who lives in Mita. CU: Is your job related to music? DN: No. I'm aiming to be a musician. I'm from Nagoya, but there aren't any good teachers here. CU: That's amazing! I also have a hobby of playing the piano and I love music. DN: I see. I can't play the piano because it's heavy, but I've been studying the harpsichord for a long time. CU: ""The sound of the harpsichord is wonderful, isn't it!"" DN: ""I can't play Chopin, but I think Bach's harpsichord tones are nice."" CU: ""Indeed, Bach suits you well. Do you have it at home too?"" DN: Yes, I have it. What do you play on the piano? CU: It's at an intermediate level, but I'm practicing pieces by Chopin and Debussy. DN: ""I admire them! I love both, but I can't play them on the harpsichord."" CU: Speaking of which, I recently visited the Yamaha piano factory in Kakegawa. DN: There are many music-related factories and concert halls in Shizuoka, aren't there? CU: It seems so. There was a harpsichord on display, and I touched it a little. DN: I see. Was it a large harpsichord? CU: No, I think it was small. DN: ""I just found out for the first time that a harpsichord is on display not only at Kawai but also at Yamaha."" CU: Is the harpsichord expensive? DN: Yes. It's a Kawai harpsichord and it's reasonably priced, but it costs 2 million yen. CU: Wow, it costs about as much as a grand piano! DN: I see. Since each one is different, I can't really afford the ones from overseas. CU: ""It probably varies a lot. Please do your best and practice hard!"" DN: Yes. Please do your best with the piano too!"
8,"CU: Good evening! DN: Good evening. Thank you in advance. CU: Have you decided on tonight's dinner? DN: We will eat out tonight. CU: ""That's great! Just the two of you?"" DN: No. My college-aged son is home for the holidays, so the three of us will go out together. CU: I see! What kind of store are you planning to go to? DN: I haven't decided yet, but I think it will be either shabu-shabu or yakiniku. CU: Wow, that's nice! Young people really do love meat! DN: That's right. Actually, I do have some options myself, but I want my son to decide. CU: I see. Are you happy when your son comes home? DN: I see. It’s because there’s no need to worry if you're nearby. CU: I understand. They say that no matter how old a son gets, he is always adorable, worrying, and concerning for his mother. DN: ""Are your children living with you?"" CU: Since we're still in junior high school, we're together. But thinking that someday we'll leave makes me feel sad. DN: That's right. I used to be a strong mother, so now I am making an effort to become a weaker one. CU: She must have been a strong mother! Her sons must have been very obedient. DN: It seems that was the problem. Seeing their weak mother, they feel they have to become strong. CU: I see. I'm also a fairly responsible person, so that's not good. DN: Mothers are always more reliable than their sons, aren't they? CU: I guess they think they have to raise a strong child. But it has the opposite effect, huh? DN: It seems so. A teacher from a boys' school scolded the boys, telling them to value their pride. CU: ""That, my mother-in-law also says it! She says boys have high pride."" DN: Yes. I think real life is more important than pride, but it seems that is not acceptable for boys. CU: I see. It's difficult, isn't it? Boys are different creatures from girls. DN: Yes, it's completely different. So it seems I have to show a bit of weakness. CU: I see. Since he's been reliable lately, I think I'll try to depend on him. DN: Yes. But if it's too weak, the other party won't be able to follow, so it seems better to be just a little weak. CU: ""Adjusting the balance is difficult, isn't it? It's a daily process of trial and error!"" DN: Yes. I will do my best again from now on!"
9,"CU: Good morning. BH: Good morning! CU: How is the weather there today? BH: It’s getting cloudy. It looks like it might start raining soon. CU: It looks like rain is forecast here too. This summer was really hot, wasn't it? BH: I see. Did you take any measures? CU: Last week, I went to an outdoor music festival, so there are things I prepared for it. BH: I see. What kind of preparations did you make? CU: Do you know about the one that supposedly NASA developed, which freezes at 28 degrees? BH: ""I don't know. Even though it's high at 28 degrees, does it freeze?"" CU: Yes, I bought the one that turns into a cooling gel and becomes a ring that you can wrap around your neck. BH: That's good. Did it have any effect? CU: It lasted for about an hour and a half, so it was quite effective! BH: ""It lasts quite well. I could only think of the cooling towels from the 100 yen shop."" CU: That's the most standard way, isn't it? But won't the clothes get wet too? BH: It depends on how you wrap it. But my son's clothes were soaked. CU: Indeed, it depends on how it's wrapped! Did you go somewhere with your son? BH: At that time, we just went out together for a hospital visit. CU: I see. You get drenched in sweat even if you just step outside for a bit, don't you? BH: I just returned from shopping, and I change everything from top to bottom. CU: That’s how it is. Doing laundry every day is tough. BH: ""Yes, it’s frustrating when it rains suddenly and I'm hanging out the laundry."" CU: We have a drum-type machine that does the drying as well. BH: I do the basics too, but there are quite a few clothes that can't be dried and it's a problem. CU: Certainly, things that get wrinkled cannot be dried, right? BH: Since my child often wears printed clothes, I avoid drying them because I don't like it when they stick together and get dirty. CU: Indeed, printed clothes do stick together! BH: Right? But last year I switched to a drum-type, and it's been easier and helpful. CU: That's right. It really helps when you're in a hurry! BH: The fluffiness of the towel cannot be restored."
10,"CU: Hello! BH: Hello! CU: Do you have any favorite foods or dishes? BH: I like spicy food. I also like shrimp, so dishes like shrimp with chili sauce are the best. CU: Ebi chili is delicious, isn't it! I also like spicy food and I'm really into Korean cuisine. BH: ""Is it often made?"" CU: I make it often recently. BH: Could you please tell me what you are making? CU: ""Samgyeopsal, chijimi, and tteokbokki. Do you know them?"" BH: ""I also make Korean pancakes sometimes. Though I use pre-mixed flour."" CU: Of course, I also use chijimi flour. The tteokbokki is also from a kit. BH: ""Such a thing exists? Can it be made easily?"" CU: It's really easy! But it might be too spicy for kids. BH: I see. My daughter who loves spicy food might be okay. CU: Is that so! Then please give it a try and buy it. BH: ""I'm interested! I'll look for it. Is it sold in regular supermarkets?"" CU: I think they are available in supermarkets recently! BH: That would be helpful. I'm going shopping today, so I'll look for it. CU: ""Samgyeopsal is easy to make and popular with children too."" BH: Is it just grilling pork? CU: Yes, and then we just make something called samjang, which is like a sweet and spicy miso. BH: ""Is what you are making also being sold?"" CU: They sell it, but if you have gochujang, you can make it with the seasonings you have at home. BH: I see. I will look into that as well. CU: The rest, we wrap the meat with things like seasoned bean sprouts, shredded green onions, and kimchi in lettuce or perilla leaves and eat it. BH: I'm getting hungry. I'm in the mood for Korean food, so I might go for that tonight. CU: Haha, please do so by all means. BH: However, there is a problem; my son is not good with spicy food. CU: The only spicy one is the ssamjang, so it might be a good idea to prepare two types, one without gochujang. BH: ""So it can work without it. Thank you for the valuable information."""
11,"CU: Thank you in advance. BH: Thank you in advance. CU: Do you have any hobbies or things you're currently into lately? BH: There's nothing in particular, but I like watching dramas. CU: I also watch a lot of dramas. What are you watching? BH: ""I watch quite a lot of things, but I like Unicorn and Sekiko to Haneo."" CU: I am also watching those two! Also ""Magic Renovation."" BH: I'm also looking at renovations. Renovations are really dreamy, aren't they? CU: Yes, it's really interesting, isn't it? BH: ""The actors are good, aren't they? Do you have a favorite actor?"" CU: You like Tomoya Nakamura, don't you? BH: It's Haneo, isn't it? They put on a good play. CU: I think it's amazing that they can play so many different roles. BH: ""He is certainly a versatile actor."" CU: ""Right. Do you have a favorite actor?"" BH: When it comes to Ishiko and Haneo, I like Akaso-kun. CU: Akaso-kun is really cool, isn't he! I've been interested in him too. BH: ""After I started liking them in another drama, I end up watching whenever they appear."" CU: Me too. I wonder what drama it was. BH: I watched ""Cherry Magic."" It was a BL drama, but it was really wonderful. CU: ""I didn't see it! I wish I could have seen it."" BH: ""I was co-starring with Keita Machida, and we were both cool and squealing."" CU: That's crazy! Mr. Machida is also in the Self-Defense Forces now, and that's cool! BH: It's cool, isn't it? I think the drama's content is so-so, but it's so cool that I can watch it without any problem. CU: I understand. The content is a bit too much of a sports club thing, isn't it? But the physical beauty is amazing. BH: Is that meant to be fan service for women? There were quite a lot, so I was a bit surprised at first. CU: I'm sure it's a service. It's a bit embarrassing, but I'll take a look. BH: ""Yes. Since I was watching it with my family, I kept it moderate."" CU: That's awkward, isn't it? But it's necessary to take a break by watching dramas and such! BH: Yes. I will keep taking breaks from now on too!"
12,"CU: Good morning. FF: Good morning! CU: It looks like it's going to be hot again today, but how is the weather over there? FF: It's somewhat sunny here. It looks like it might rain. CU: I see. Is this an area that doesn't seem to have damage from this typhoon? FF: Yes. I live in the Kanto region. Where are you from? CU: We are in Kansai, but the typhoon seems to be okay. FF: In the end, it's still around Kyushu, right? Who knows what will happen. CU: There really has been a lot of abnormal weather lately. FF: ""Yes, it is a bit scary, isn't it? Disasters happen every year."" CU: Yes. The heat is abnormal too. FF: This year was hot, wasn't it? Or is it still hot? CU: It's really hot. The other day, I got heatstroke and it was tough. FF: Were you okay? Were you out somewhere or something? CU: Yes, I was at a music festival called Summer Sonic. FF: Sounds good. Outdoor events might be a bit risky, though. CU: Yes, I was in a place without shade for about five hours and suffered from a severe headache and nausea. FF: That's terrible, you won't even be able to enjoy the festival. CU: That's right. I went to the first-aid room myself and rested for a while. FF: I see. Well, it's good that it didn't turn into something serious! CU: Yes, I managed to see the stage of the artist I was aiming for somehow. FF: Who were you looking for? CU: ""It's a Korean idol group and a band called One Ok Rock."" FF: You understand ONE OK ROCK, right? I haven't been listening to them much lately! CU: ""One OK Rock was really exciting!"" FF: ""It looks like it will be exciting. I haven't been to a concert at all."" CU: Sometimes when I go, it helps me relieve stress. FF: Yes, I don't want to accumulate stress. CU: Yes, let's both be careful! FF: Thank you very much!"
