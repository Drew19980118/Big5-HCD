1,"EQ: Hello. DG: Hello! EQ: Did you go back to your hometown this summer? DG: I went back to my parents' house, so I've been relaxing the whole time. EQ: I see. It's nice to be able to take it easy. DG: Did you go back to your hometown? EQ: Yes. I went back to my hometown in Yamanashi. It was hot. DG: Yamanashi is nice! I used to go there often to eat hoto (a type of noodle dish). EQ: Summer is hot. There are lots of delicious fruits. DG: ""It's really a very charming prefecture! Especially for someone who loves to eat!"" EQ: I see. Since I always have them sent to me, I've never bought grapes or peaches myself. DG: ""That's nice, peaches are nice. Recently, I've seen Yamanashi grape wine."" EQ: I mostly like California wine. DG: I am not very knowledgeable, but I was impressed that there is delicious wine in Japan. EQ: As someone from Yamanashi, that makes me happy! DG: Do you often drink wine? EQ: Since my husband likes it, I end up having more opportunities to drink. DG: I see, is your husband knowledgeable about it? EQ: I love it. There are many heavy drinkers around. DG: Ahaha, I also like drinking wine with him, but we both don't know much about it, so I'm envious. EQ: ""It's easy because it picks for me automatically. I usually find something cheap to drink."" DG: I also look for cheap ones when I drink alone! I can't quit alcohol. EQ: Actually, you like alcohol too, don't you? DG: ""I quite like it. Yesterday, I had and was drinking grape liqueur."" EQ: If I had to choose, I prefer sweet and low-alcohol drinks. DG: Do you drink chuhai? EQ: I only drink chuhai when I go to an izakaya. DG: I see. I drink green tea highballs at home. It seems like an old man's habit. EQ: I have never had green tea highball. I want to try it. DG: I ended up doing it with little guilt!"
2,"EQ: Hello. How are you doing? DG: Hello. I'm in a good mood listening to music. EQ: What kind of music is it? DG: I've been into a band called Maneskin lately. EQ: I am not very familiar with it, but what genre would it be? DG: It's rock music. I also encountered it for the first time at the festival the other day. EQ: Oh. You went to a rock festival, didn't you? DG: Yes, I participated for the first time in several years. It was tough because it was hot. EQ: By the way, where was the location? DG: It's Makuhari. EQ: It looks like a lot of people will gather. DG: There were quite a few people. More than I expected. EQ: ""Do you do that kind of thing at night?"" DG: It starts around 10 o'clock and continues until the evening. EQ: ""Is it that long? I wonder if I can go in and out?"" DG: ""It's like securing a chair and taking a rest within the premises."" EQ: So, it's outdoors. DG: Makuhari Messe was indoors and the stadium was outdoors! EQ: So, the performance is indoors and the audience is outdoors? DG: There were about six stages, and the stadium was the biggest stage. EQ: ""Does it mean that it progresses simultaneously on multiple stages?"" DG: That's right. I think there were about three indoor stages and about three outdoor ones. EQ: That's an incredible scale. If we could hear each other, our ears would probably go crazy. DG: ""The sound was fine, but the stage movement was too tough."" EQ: It means ""It's quite spacious, isn't it?"" DG: Yes, I took the bus and such. I'm exhausted from the crowds that I haven't experienced in a while. EQ: Bus! That's amazing. It looks like I'm going to get lost and separated from the people I went with. DG: ""A smartphone was absolutely necessary. The unfamiliar festival was tiring!"" EQ: But it's a good experience. I'm envious because I've never been there. DG: Thank you very much for listening to all sorts of things. EQ: ""Likewise. Thank you for the enjoyable conversation."""
3,"EQ: Hello! AJ: Hello! EQ: Did you go back to your hometown this year? AJ: No, my parents' house is very close, so not particularly. How about you? Did you go back home for Obon? EQ: Yes, I went back to my hometown this year. My husband's mother is elderly, you see. AJ: I see. Are you traveling by train or by car? EQ: I traveled by car. It was just from the 14th to the 17th, so it wasn’t crowded and that was nice. AJ: It's a bit late, isn't it? But the timing was good. Do you visit gravesites as well? EQ: Since the welcoming fire was already done on the 14th, I did not go to the grave. AJ: I see. My family doesn't really observe traditions like visiting graves or Obon, so I was a bit curious and asked. EQ: My family home also had little connection since my father was the fourth son. AJ: As I thought, there are indeed people like that. I feel a bit more at ease now. EQ: I wonder if the number of children has anything to do with it. AJ: ""After all, since the eldest son usually inherits the family line, I think it matters. And also the family background, I guess."" EQ: ""Also, is it that they live outside the prefecture?"" AJ: That's true. When it's close, you somehow end up not going, right? EQ: Don't you go if it's close? I can't go even if it's far. AJ: Yes, that's right. If it's far away, the only time to go back home is during holidays. EQ: Because of the spread of COVID-19, there was a time when I refrained from going back home for about a year and a half. AJ: I see. Because we couldn't go out before, maybe now that's causing an increase. EQ: The expressway was crowded on the 14th, especially going towards the city. AJ: It's a U-turn, right? The Obon festival is over, I'm feeling unwell, and now the test results are in! Is that how it is? EQ: Wow, that sounds scary. It's been five days since I got home, but I'm still okay. AJ: If five days pass, won't it be okay? It seems that people usually feel unwell about three days later. EQ: I see. When it happens, the whole family gets affected, so it's better if we don't get it. AJ: It is true. There are people around me whose families have been infected, but they couldn't be hospitalized and had to recuperate at home. EQ: It seems to be like that everywhere now. My brother is in Tokyo, and it appears that food has been sent to him. AJ: It seems they are distributing a considerable amount of food. People undergoing hotel quarantine have said that the bento boxes are not very tasty. EQ: Food is mostly ready-to-eat, so it was said that fresh foods were bought online. It's a convenient world. AJ: It's true. I'm glad that the internet is widespread."
4,"EQ: Good evening. BO: Please. EQ: Have you had anything recently that you found enjoyable? BO: I went to a summer festival last Sunday. EQ: I see. It seems like many people were going. BO: I was very happy to see many of my favorite artists. EQ: That's good. Since I have never been there, please tell me about it. BO: Do you often listen to music and such? EQ: Recently, not so much, but I like it. BO: They host various festivals featuring Western and Japanese music, so please try to check them out. EQ: Understood. Where was the location this time? BO: It’s a festival called Summer Sonic that was held in Makuhari. EQ: The venue is a spacious place. BO: Yes, there were various stages and I walked around all day. EQ: That will be good exercise. BO: ""That's right. I walked more than 20,000 steps that day."" EQ: Amazing! Even if you don't intend to exercise, you end up doing it. You must be hungry. BO: There were many food stalls, so I ate quite a lot. EQ: You also sing songs together, right? BO: I see. Overseas artists and such were all raising their voices. EQ: So, overseas artists are coming too, right? Did you recognize anyone? BO: I don't usually listen to Western music so I didn't know, but it was really powerful. EQ: By the way, what is your favorite music genre? BO: It's a band, isn't it! I went to that festival specifically for ONE OK ROCK. EQ: It looks like fun. It seems like it's really steamy with excitement. BO: The outdoor area was incredibly hot. EQ: It was a hot day, wasn't it? You need to drink plenty of fluids. BO: Yes. So I was taking a lot of them. EQ: But, eating food, listening to my favorite music, I feel happy. BO: That's right. It was very fulfilling."
5,"EQ: Good evening. BO: Please. EQ: ""Have you had any problems recently?"" BO: Hmm... Is it that my body was gradually getting heavier? EQ: Does ""becoming heavier"" mean that you gained weight? BO: That is also true, and I think the movements had become sluggish. EQ: Do you know what caused that? BO: Is it lack of exercise? EQ: Ah, I see. Sometimes I become dull because of my age. BO: I see. I used to be active in the past, but now it's completely gone. EQ: The coronavirus pandemic has also made me go out less. BO: That's right. I intend to exercise at home, but I just can't get motivated. EQ: I made up my mind and started going to a women-only gym the other day! BO: ""Wow, women-only is nice."" EQ: It is a well-advertised place. It's easygoing because I don't have to worry about it. BO: Certainly. ""Indeed. It's nice not having to worry about others when it's just girls."" EQ: ""There are many elderly people too. The staff often talks to me, so it's enjoyable."" BO: ""Are the staff members women as well?"" EQ: Yes. All the people coming and going are women. BO: Sounds good. I wish there was one near my place too. EQ: I think there are places that advertise that it can be done in 30 minutes. BO: There are quite a few gyms around, but I've never seen one that's women-only. EQ: ""It might not feel like a gym. There are also many elderly people. For me, it's just the right amount of exercise."" BO: That's right. Even I might find it a bit hard to go to a hardcore gym. EQ: I previously overdid it and got tired after exercising, so I think this much is just right. BO: Doing it at your own pace is the best. EQ: ""It's easy to do since it's only an hour from leaving home to coming back."" BO: That sounds good. Maybe I'll give it a try. EQ: Please try to search for it. Exercising will improve both your physical and mental condition. BO: Yes. Thank you for the talk."
6,"EQ: Hello. EV: Hello, nice to meet you. EQ: Do you like animals? EV: I don't dislike them, but since I have never had one, I can't really say. EQ: So, what comes to mind when you think of animals? EV: Is it a cat or a dog? EQ: I knew it. Do you want to keep one? EV: I don't really think so. It seems difficult. EQ: When I was a child, I had a dog. EV: ""Sounds good. Is it large?"" EQ: No, it was a normal size. It was a mixed breed. EV: Oh, I often think that puppies are cute. EQ: ""At first, it was a puppy. It just followed me."" EV: I see. Watching the growth was a great reward. EQ: Yes. There used to be some dogs that were allowed to roam freely. EV: I am worried that the dog might bark and cause trouble with the neighbors. EQ: Now everyone is keeping them inside the house. EV: I used to live in a residential area, and there was a house that kept a dog inside, but I could hear it to some extent. EQ: I see. It is now an era where even large dogs are kept inside the house. EV: It looks cramped, doesn't it? From a dog's perspective. EQ: It was difficult because I kept it outside, but it was fun. EV: If you don't like taking walks, it seems like you won't be able to continue. EQ: Everyone, it's impressive that you take a walk every day. EV: Yes, it seems like it will take up a lot of time. EQ: After all, it might be best to have pets when you are a child. EV: That's right. We also have plenty of time. EQ: I feel like my heart becomes enriched. EV: It is important to gain experience while you are still young. EQ: ""I was playing with the dog and stuff."" EV: That's nice."
7,"EQ: Hello. EV: Hello, nice to meet you. EQ: What drink do you like: coffee or tea? EV: I drink more tea. EQ: ""When you say tea, there are various kinds, but specifically?"" EV: Is it barley tea? EQ: Barley tea! Summer is nice, isn't it? EV: Yes, green tea upsets my stomach, so I can't drink a lot of it. EQ: I see. Drinking warm green tea soothes my stomach. EV: I see, it seems that green tea has a diuretic effect, so I can't drink it in large amounts. EQ: Green tea is good for constipation, and warm green tea is good for dehydration. EV: I see, I'll look into it next time. EQ: I like coffee, but when I drink it, I have to go to the restroom more often. EV: It seems so. I remember drinking coffee during exam periods. EQ: You have been drinking since you were young, haven't you? Did the caffeine work? EV: It didn't work that well. Maybe it's my constitution. EQ: Does ""it didn't work"" mean it didn't work as a stimulant? EV: That's right. It feels like staying sleepy when you're sleepy. EQ: You are someone who can drink coffee before bed without any problems. EV: Sure. I think it’s okay. EQ: I envy you. I can't sleep at all. EV: It's the type that works too well. EQ: I see. Also, the pain increases when my stomach hurts. EV: ""That is troubling. If you like it, it might be difficult."" EQ: I love it, so I'm troubled. At times like that, there's nothing I can do, so I drink green tea. EV: I have come to terms with it, or rather, I no longer drink coffee when I'm sleepy. EQ: Well, what will you drink? EV: It's water. Sleep peacefully. EQ: The universal water, huh? That might be good. It seems like it could purify. EV: I don't want to wake up in the toilet."
8,"EQ: Hello! FW: Hello! EQ: Do you often drink coffee or tea? FW: I drink a lot. I particularly like coffee, but I try to drink decaf. EQ: Why is it decaffeinated? FW: It seems my body is too sensitive to caffeine, and I really can't sleep at night. EQ: I see. I also can't sleep, so I don't drink coffee at night. FW: I see! Do you like tea as well? EQ: Yes, I drink anything. Although I'm not very good with herbal tea. FW: I think enjoying tea is really nice. Do you have any favorite tea in particular? EQ: Yes, I wonder if it will be green tea in the end. FW: That's nice. Do you have any preferences for the tea leaves? EQ: No, I don't have much knowledge. It's just that my father's family home was in Shizuoka, so I'm used to drinking it. FW: Sounds good! People from Shizuoka must have many opportunities to drink tea, don't they? EQ: Isn't it just tea? I've also had something called Kukicha. FW: I don't know what kukicha is. What kind of thing is it? EQ: It seems that the stem part is included, not the leaves. FW: Is that so? I would like to try it. Does the flavor also differ? EQ: It's a bit light, but it was easy to drink. FW: It seems good. I remember the tea farmers in Shizuoka I saw on TV had smooth skin. EQ: Tea is good for beauty, isn't it! I wonder if it's thanks to the vitamins. FW: I heard it has a lot of vitamins. Seeing that, I thought I should drink green tea too. EQ: Green tea seems to be good for my stomach. FW: Is that so! Will you feel better? EQ: When I'm not feeling well, I avoid coffee and drink green tea instead, which warms my stomach and feels nice. FW: That's very nice. I usually drink it as cold brew, but it's going to get colder, so I'll drink hot tea. EQ: In the summer, I mostly drink barley tea, but warm tea is the best because it's calming. FW: Warm tea is nice, isn't it? The aroma also helps to relax. EQ: There might be a psychological aspect to it. It's almost running out, so I have to go buy more soon. FW: ""That's nice. I thought I should enjoy tea more as well."""
9,"EQ: Hello! DF: Hello! EQ: What time did you wake up today? DF: I woke up around 8 o'clock today. EQ: Is that the rest mode? DF: Is it a little later than weekdays? EQ: I see. Recently, I've been having trouble waking up in the morning. DF: I understand. I'm also not a morning person... EQ: When it gets cooler, it seems I end up oversleeping. DF: It's become a season where it's quite easy to fall asleep, hasn't it? EQ: Yes. I took out the comforter yesterday. DF: ""Will it get cold again all at once from here? This season is the best."" EQ: I see. I think I need to start swapping out my clothes soon. DF: That's right! There are still summer clothes I want to wear, but it seems like I won't be able to anymore. EQ: It would be unfortunate if it were newly bought summer clothes. DF: Yes, I still wanted to wear T-shirts and tank tops, but... EQ: Then, how about wearing those and putting a jacket on top? DF: That's right! Indeed! It seems like it can be managed depending on the coordination! EQ: ""Show only what you want to show!"" DF: I'll try that! Did you buy any fall clothes? EQ: No, not yet. But I want to go buy it soon. DF: That's right. I was also looking at various things on Instagram yesterday and ended up wanting them. EQ: It's also good to go after getting various information. DF: That's right! I often go to buy things after seeing them online or just buy them online as they are. EQ: I also like shopping online, but do you have any recommended online shops? DF: I often use ZOZO TOWN. EQ: Oh. ZOZO TOWN is nice, isn't it? But I haven't purchased anything from there yet. DF: I see! I feel like it's easier to search. Although shipping fees will definitely apply... EQ: ""There is no free shipping, is there? But I am interested, so I will take a look!"" DF: Please take a look!"
10,"EQ: Hello! DF: Hello! EQ: Is COVID-19 spreading recently? DF: Well, I live in Tokyo, so it's calmer than during the peak period, but I caught it last month... EQ: I see. If you don't mind, please tell me your symptoms. DF: At first, I felt discomfort in my throat, and then my throat started to hurt. EQ: Did you have a fever? DF: The fever went down in a day, but it went up to around the high 37 degrees Celsius. EQ: Thank you very much. I apologize if I reminded you of something painful. DF: No, no, it's completely fine! Anyway, my throat hurt! But I still had an appetite! EQ: I am still worried because it hasn't been resolved yet. DF: It's worrisome, isn't it? If you feel discomfort in your throat, it might be something to watch out for. EQ: It's the throat, isn't it? I think I should be careful. DF: Yes! But with it being this widespread, it's not surprising if one gets infected anytime. EQ: These days, even at hair salons, they tell you not to wear a mask, so I wonder what that's about. DF: When you go to the beauty salon, you tend to be quite mindful, don't you? EQ: It seems like it gets in the way when coloring. DF: I see. Especially around the ears. Since I was never good at talking at the salon, a silent salon is much appreciated...! EQ: I often talk with my hairstylist, but since it's a customer-oriented business, I think it's better for both of us to be considerate. DF: ""That's certainly true! Speaking of hair salons, I recently had my hair cut short!"" EQ: You took a big step. DF: ""It's been a while since it's been short, but I'm thinking it's so easy."" EQ: Did something change in your mindset? DF: It's a change of pace. With the coronavirus, I've been feeling depressed for a while... EQ: You must feel refreshed. The humidity has been high recently. DF: That's right! It gets humid when a typhoon approaches. EQ: When it is humid, my hair starts to frizz. DF: ""It becomes difficult to organize, doesn't it?"" EQ: That's right. Maybe my hair texture has changed recently. DF: I see. There is also a change in hair texture."
11,"EQ: Hello! EV: Hello, nice to meet you. EQ: Do you have any siblings? EV: I have one younger sister. EQ: You're the older brother, right? I'm the younger sister. EV: Oh, I see. EQ: I have an older brother who is three years older than me. EV: I am 6 years apart. EQ: ""It's a bit far, isn't it? Are you someone who likes to have conversations?"" EV: ""I don't initiate conversations. They are quite talkative."" EQ: Isn't it nice that your younger sister talked to you? EV: At home, I'm the type who likes to be alone, so it was probably annoying when I was trying to concentrate. That's what I remember. EQ: I see. Well, I suppose that's how it is. EV: Well, since we no longer live together, the distance between us is good now. EQ: I'm also the type who prefers to be alone. EV: That's right. Spending time occasionally is just right. EQ: When we are together, we end up arguing. EV: You understand, right? It's not the same type. EQ: It's completely different. Now we communicate at a moderate distance. EV: You've settled down. The sense of distance feels just right. EQ: I think it would be different if it's the same gender, but if there's a three-year difference and the gender is different, it's subtle. EV: ""Well, our hobbies were different. There was a larger age difference, so we didn't get along."" EQ: ""From my younger sister's perspective, it was painful to always be seen as immature."" EV: Well, being three years apart isn't that big of a difference. Now that I think about it. EQ: That's right. The three years of a child's life and the three years of an adult's life are different, aren't they? EV: ""It's completely different. There are younger people who seem mature."" EQ: Nowadays, I can talk without considering age differences very much. EV: ""It depends on the person. I get really nervous around much older people."" EQ: I see. I get very nervous around people much younger than me. EV: Oh, it's the other way around."
12,"EQ: Hello! BV: Hello! EQ: Do you watch videos often? BV: I often watch video streams! EQ: I also watch YouTube often! BV: What type are you watching? EQ: ""It's a variety of things, but mostly stretching, audition shows, and cooking."" BV: What is an audition program?! EQ: Originally, it's a program called ""Got Talent"" on America's AGT. BV: ""Oh, is it that famous one?"" EQ: Susan Boyle is famous, isn't she? BV: ""Is it interesting? I haven't seen it!"" EQ: It's interesting. Various people appear, from small children to adults. BV: Is that so? Were you going to showcase something? EQ: There are a lot of songs, but there are also dances and various other things. BV: I see! There are various videos on YouTube! EQ: ""It's convenient, isn't it? Recently, I've been cooking while watching YouTube."" BV: Oh, what a way to use it! EQ: The other day, I tried making a Taiwanese castella cake that I was interested in! BV: What was Taiwanese castella like again? EQ: ""It has a fluffy and chewy texture. It has a gentle sweetness."" BV: Wow, amazing! Can you make that at home? EQ: ""I made it with a rice cooker! I've never seen it sold in stores."" BV: Ah, I see! Was it delicious? EQ: ""It was quite delicious. Please try searching for Taiwan castella. You will find many results."" BV: I will look into it! I feel like eating it now! EQ: By the way, I used rice flour instead of wheat flour, and it turned out delicious. BV: ""Isn't making rice flour sweets difficult? You managed to do it!"" EQ: Recently, I use rice flour for everything instead of wheat flour, but it's okay. BV: Is that so? Amazing!"
