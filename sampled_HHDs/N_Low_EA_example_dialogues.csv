1,"EA: Hello! CP: Hello! EA: ""It's been hot lately, hasn't it? Are you doing anything to cope with it?"" CP: ""I put up the bamboo blinds!"" EA: ""Is it a sudare? I've heard of it, but what kind was it again?"" CP: The thing woven from grass? that covers windows and such. EA: Oh, I remember now! Is that used to open windows? CP: No, no. It's to avoid the sunlight. Even with the windows closed, it creates a nice shade. EA: ""I see. Is it like a curtain?"" CP: Actually, I wanted to have a green curtain. EA: ""Is it a green curtain?"" CP: It's the thing where you let gourds and such climb on nets hanging from the second floor of the house. EA: ""Oh, it feels like a curtain made of plants. It seems like taking care of it would be quite difficult, right?"" CP: Goya can be left alone apparently. I find it troublesome to attach the net! EA: Is that so! Can you eat it when the bitter melon grows? CP: Of course! It's delicious, isn't it! EA: ""It's delicious, isn't it? I didn't like it much when I was a child, though."" CP: I understand. I started liking it after becoming an adult. EA: Vegetables often give that kind of impression, don't they? Eggplants too. CP: Yes, especially summer vegetables! EA: Summer vegetables are nice! Like cucumbers. I feel like I've aged. CP: Cucumber! It's the season for delicious whole bites. EA: ""It's fresh and delicious, right? It goes well with alcohol too."" CP: Right! By the way, how do you cook bitter melon? EA: ""I only know about goya champuru, what other dishes are there?"" CP: Champuru is nice! I also make tsukudani and salad. EA: Both the tsukudani and the salad look delicious! Maybe I'll look up a recipe and try making them next time. CP: Definitely! Salad mixed with canned tuna is quite good! EA: ""It looks like it can be done easily! It seems good for summer as well."" CP: Yes! It also goes well with alcohol!"
2,"EA: Nice to meet you, hello. CP: Nice to meet you! EA: Did you take any lessons or classes when you were a child? CP: I used to do piano and swimming. EA: Do you still like piano and swimming? CP: ""I can't read sheet music for the piano, you know. I still swim!"" EA: Does that mean you didn't play the piano for a very long period of time? CP: No, I've actually been playing quite a bit. I can even play some relatively difficult songs. EA: Is that so? It's something you can play even if you can't read sheet music! CP: It's mysterious, isn't it? The teacher was surprised. EA: It feels like you've completely memorized it with your fingers. I really sense an incredible talent. CP: No, no. I really guessed! Just somehow! Because of that, it seems like no matter how hard I try, I can't play it. EA: I see. Are you very good at swimming since you've been doing it for a long time? CP: The time is not so fast anymore, but I can keep swimming for one or two kilometers continuously. EA: ""Wow, that's amazing! I'm struggling with even 25 meters. I probably can't do it now."" CP: I see. Did you take any lessons? EA: ""You played tennis, right? For about 4 to 5 years?"" CP: Tennis! Amazing! Was it around the time you were in elementary school? EA: ""I started in middle school. My friends invited me. I'm not that good at it though!"" CP: I see. Is it hardball? EA: It's hardball. I've also experienced softball in school classes, but it was completely different. CP: You say so, right? I've played softball for fun. EA: I remember it being fun to hit with all my strength in the softball. In the hardball, my grip strength was trained. CP: Oh, really? That much of a difference. By the way, what is your grip strength? EA: Around 50. How about you? CP: ""Amazing, amazing! Umm, probably less than 20."" EA: As I thought, you can't improve your grip strength without training, huh? It was the same for the people around me too. CP: I see. I certainly don't remember ever working out. EA: ""In hardball tennis, if you don't have grip strength, the racket will fly away."" CP: I see! I didn't know that!"
3,"EA: Hello! CP: Hello. Nice to meet you. EA: Do you have any hobbies? CP: ""Reading, I guess? I also like swimming."" EA: Reading is great! What kind of genres do you read? CP: Mainly mysteries. EA: Mystery! I like it too. I'm not very knowledgeable about it though. CP: ""It's interesting, isn't it? What kind of authors have you read?"" EA: A long time ago, a friend recommended it to me, so I read ""Everything Becomes F."" CP: ""Mr. Mori, right? You are very popular!"" EA: I see! I didn't know it was something famous. CP: Mr. Mori's debut work, that series is extremely popular. EA: Mr. Mori is amazing! Is he writing anything else? CP: ""He has written a lot of books. Umm. The Sky Crawlers series was also interesting!"" EA: Hmm, I should take notes for the next time I read it. CP: It's more of a battle fantasy than a mystery. EA: Is that so? You can write various things! By the way, do you have any recommendations? CP: Recently, it would be Masahiro Imamura's ""Murders at the House of Corpses."" EA: Ah, it might have been at the bookstore because the title looks familiar from somewhere. CP: ""It sold like crazy and was even made into a movie!"" EA: I see, it was made into a movie! No wonder it sounded familiar. CP: Yes, this person also releases a series, and they are all interesting. EA: Mr. Masahiro Imamura, right? I'll remember that. By the way, did you watch the movie? CP: I watched it! The movie was good too! EA: Oh! I heard some adaptations deviate a lot from the original, but that was good! CP: The mystery element was stronger in the original work, but the movie also had a good atmosphere and was interesting! EA: It's hard to decide which one to watch first, isn't it? Should I start with the original work after all? CP: ""Yes, from the original work definitely!"" EA: Understood. My weekend enjoyment has increased! CP: I'm glad. Please let me know your thoughts once you've read it!"
4,"EA: Hello. CP: Hello! EA: Do you have any favorite foods? CP: I like tomatoes! EA: ""Tomatoes, many people don't like them, right?"" CP: That's right. Fresh tomatoes, soup, pasta, ketchup! I love them all. EA: I also like tomatoes. It's just tomato juice that I'm not good with. CP: Ah. I actually like juice as well, but many people don't, right? EA: Yes, I can drink it, but I feel that there are many that are a bit strong. CP: I see. It's kind of thick. EA: For some reason, I just don't like it. But since tomatoes are used in various dishes, I do like tomatoes! CP: Oh, I see! What kind of things do you like? EA: I like things like hamburg steak and fried chicken, basically meat dishes. CP: It's delicious, isn't it! I like both! EA: ""Right! Did you know that there is a hamburger specialty store in Shizuoka Prefecture?"" CP: No. I don't know! Where did you find out? EA: I heard from a friend that there is a place called ""Sawayaka"" and just watching the video made my mouth water. CP: ""Oh! I want to go, but Shizuoka is far away."" EA: I'm also far away, but if I ever get a chance to go nearby, I would like to visit. CP: Right! By the way, when it comes to karaage, Oita is famous. Did you know that? EA: I've heard of Oita's karaage. Also toriten! CP: Yes, yes. And Toriten as well! There are many take-out karaage shops. EA: I see, it looks like you won't have any trouble with dinner! CP: Yes, yes! We no longer make fried chicken! EA: ""Is it non-fried karaage?"" CP: Excuse me. At home, it is. At home. EA: Ah, my mistake! Sorry. I don't cook much, so I didn't think of frying at home. CP: I see! Since the taste varies from store to store, it's fun to compare them. EA: Sounds good! I'd like to try walking around and tasting various flavors! CP: ""That's right! Everything is so delicious that I can't rank them! If you go to Oita, definitely try them!"""
5,"EA: Good evening. DY: Good evening, nice to meet you. EA: Was work today? DY: Yes, I was working remotely for a day. EA: I see. The coronavirus is spreading, isn't it? DY: Were you at work today? EA: Yes. The rain was heavy and there were few customers. DY: Is it some kind of customer service job? EA: I see, I work in a restaurant. DY: It's a restaurant, right? I'm not good at customer service, so I think it's amazing. EA: Serving customers is tough, isn't it? But on days like today, you can take it easy. DY: ""I see. In customer service, you can't choose your customers, can you? It's tough, isn't it?"" EA: I see, there are many good customers, but sometimes there are those who are difficult to communicate with. However, I'm used to it now. DY: I see. It definitely makes me happy when there are good customers. EA: I see, what kind of work do you do? DY: I am a system engineer. I am always in front of the computer. EA: Amazing! You seem to know a lot about computers! DY: ""I am not at all knowledgeable! I'm just a little fast at typing!"" EA: Can you do touch typing? DY: Blind typing is something I've been able to do since my school days because I was using the internet from back then! EA: You've been familiar with it since a long time ago, I'm envious because I only started as an adult. DY: I am grateful to my parents for having a PC at home since I was in elementary school. EA: What did you do on the PC when you were a child? DY: That's right, I used to chat with my friends for a long time. Now it has been replaced by LINE. EA: Is it a chat? Sounds good. DY: Yes, it was quite enjoyable as I made new friends over the internet. EA: I see! Since PCs are becoming more common, do kids these days all chat and stuff? DY: Nowadays, there might be many people who no longer have a PC at home. I wonder if everyone is using LINE on their smartphones? EA: Ah, certainly smartphones are popular, aren't they? We've come to a good era. DY: It might be tough, but I think it's a good time!"
6,"EA: Good evening. Nice to meet you. DY: Good evening, thank you in advance. EA: Do you have any hobbies? DY: That's right, since I prefer staying indoors, I watch videos and play games. EA: I see, me too. What kind of games do you play? DY: I mainly play Splatoon on the Switch. EA: When it comes to Splatoon, it seems like 3 is coming out, right? DY: Yes, I'm really looking forward to it coming out next month! EA: Sounds great! I've never done it before, but isn't it difficult? DY: It's definitely difficult until you get used to it. But once you do, it's an incredibly fun game! EA: I see, there are various rules, aren't there? Which rule do you like? DY: I like the rule called ""Gachi Area"" where you paint a specific area. EA: I see, I understand because I've seen streamers do it! It's the one that prioritizes areas, right? DY: Yes, that's right! Do you watch game live streams? EA: Yes, rather than continuing to watch the same streamer, it's more like I watch various ones. DY: I see! I often watch game streams too. What kind of games do you usually play? EA: I play Minecraft and Monster Hunter, and various other games with my friends. DY: I see. I've only ever played Minecraft solo, but it seems like it would be fun to play with friends! EA: ""It's fun! It's also enjoyable to explore the completed MAP."" DY: That sounds great! I often find myself quietly mining ores alone, so I'm envious of that kind of enjoyment! EA: ""Everyone is doing other interesting things that streamers are doing too. We're doing various things."" DY: I see. Do you feel like you have gaming buddies? EA: Yes, it feels like it grew as I played games with acquaintances of people I met through games. DY: That's great! I also have some Splatoon buddies, and we sometimes play together. EA: ""It's nice to have gaming friends, isn't it! Do you play any other games?"" DY: That's right, I often play games alone. Like Pokémon. EA: Pokémon seems fun too. I haven't played the recent ones, so I can't keep up. DY: I had stopped at the older ones myself, but when I started recently, it was interesting. I'm looking forward to the new release coming out this year. EA: A new one is coming out, huh! Seeing cute Pokémon on social media makes me want to play a little! DY: Yes, I am looking forward to the new release because the grass-type starter Pokémon is a cute cat!"
7,"EA: Hello! CZ: Hello! EA: Have you already had breakfast today? CZ: I ate it. I ate the leftover somen. EA: Somen noodles are good! They feel like summer! CZ: In the summer, I often eat somen noodles. EA: I often eat somen too. I like it because it's cheap and easy to make. CZ: Cooking is easy, isn't it? EA: Yes, yes, are you good at cooking? CZ: I cook for myself, but I'm not very good at it. EA: I see, I'm not very good at it either. Do you have any easy recipes? CZ: Somen noodles and chilled tofu are super easy. EA: ""Chilled tofu is also good! I also like rice with raw egg!"" CZ: On holiday mornings, I also eat rice with raw egg. EA: ""It's easy and good, isn't it? Do you eat things like bread?"" CZ: On weekdays when I don't have time, I eat white bread every day. EA: It's great because the taste can change quite a bit depending on what you spread on it. CZ: ""Even with bread, doesn't the taste change depending on the amount of soy sauce used in tamago kake gohan?"" EA: Well, I like it a little stronger, how about you? CZ: I am trying out darker and lighter shades to find the best one. EA: ""There are quite a few different types of soy sauce, so I'm still exploring. As for bread, I like peanut butter."" CZ: ""I haven't tried peanut butter much. It's a bit expensive."" EA: Certainly. But since it's delicious, I end up buying it. Butter has also become more expensive recently, hasn't it? CZ: I always put mayonnaise on it. EA: ""Is it mayonnaise? Is it delicious?"" CZ: Well, it's delicious. EA: ""I have tried something like pizza mayonnaise in a tube, and it was indeed delicious."" CZ: You eat it with a fried egg on top. EA: That looks delicious too! Even though it's before lunch, I'm getting hungry. I'll excuse myself with this. CZ: It's delicious!"
8,"EA: Hello! CZ: Hello! EA: Where do you live? CZ: It's in the western part of Kansai. EA: Was it Kansai? I'm from Kyushu, but I envy Kansai! CZ: I see. It's a remote countryside. EA: I see. When you mention Kansai, I had the impression that there are a lot of people. CZ: ""There are people in urban areas, but here there are many mountains, rivers, and rice fields."" EA: Kansai has various aspects, doesn't it? Do you go to the city center to have fun? CZ: I hardly go. I prefer playing outdoors. EA: What comes to mind when you think of the outdoors? CZ: Surfing and mountain climbing, I guess. EA: Oh, awesome! Isn't surfing in season right now? CZ: In midsummer, the weather is too good and there are no waves, so the period right after Obon is the perfect time. EA: I see. Surfing is difficult, isn't it? How long have you been doing it? CZ: It's been about 15 or 16 years, but it's only about 2 or 3 times a year, haha. EA: You are quite a veteran, how long have you been doing mountain climbing? CZ: I started mountain climbing when I was looking for other activities to do during the COVID-19 pandemic. EA: I see. If that's the case, then it might be recent. I have memories from my childhood where I didn't want to go hiking anymore. CZ: Why is that? Did something happen? EA: I think I was simply tired from walking. My parents liked hiking, so we often went. CZ: That pleasant tiredness from walking becomes addictive. EA: It might be different if I go now as an adult. Since I have a lot of indoor hobbies, I need to exercise a bit. CZ: You spend your time watching videos, right? EA: I see. I often watch YouTube. Do you watch it? CZ: I sometimes watch it before going to bed. EA: There are various videos, right? Are there also videos of surfing and mountain climbing? CZ: There are, but they all look the same, haha. EA: When it's a video, that might be the case. It seems like there's a kind of fun that only those who are doing it can understand. Haha. CZ: It's fun to try anything."
9,"EA: Hello! Nice to meet you. CZ: Hello. Nice to meet you! EA: Do you often read books? CZ: ""I read fairly often."" EA: What kind of books do you read? CZ: I used to read novels a lot in the past. EA: ""Is it a novel? What genre do you like?"" CZ: I liked Ryotaro Shiba's historical novels. EA: History, huh! I'm not well-versed in history, but it piques my interest. CZ: ""It's not difficult and interesting. Like Ryoma ga Yuku."" EA: I've heard of that! Was it a work by Ryotaro Shiba? CZ: Yes, it's about Ryoma Sakamoto. EA: Ryoma Sakamoto is the famous person who said ""Japan's dawn,"" right? CZ: It's that person! You understand. EA: I remember learning it at school. But, I don't really remember what we did. Haha. CZ: What kind of books do you read? EA: I read a lot of manga. Recently, I was recommended some mystery novels and read them too. CZ: What kind of manga do you read? EA: The manga I read recently is Blue Period. CZ: ""It's a manga I've never heard of before. What is it about?"" EA: ""It's a manga about a somewhat non-serious high school student who aims to go to an art university after being praised by an art teacher!"" CZ: ""Is it okay to have an image like Biri Gyaru?"" EA: Excuse me, I don't know ""Biri Gyaru"", but is it a similar story? CZ: ""It's a story about an underachieving student aiming for a prestigious university. I don't know the details, though."" EA: ""Like Dragon Zakura?"" CZ: I guess it's somewhat similar, there was such a manga. EA: I'm glad you knew. Yes, that's right. It feels like aiming to pass through hard work. I could read it even without knowing about art. CZ: I thought you liked art. EA: ""I probably like being able to learn about completely unknown worlds."" CZ: It's exciting, isn't it!"
10,"EA: Hello! Nice to meet you! CZ: Thank you in advance! EA: Do you have a favorite animal? CZ: Cheetahs are cool, aren't they? EA: Certainly, since I like cats, I might like cheetah cubs! CZ: ""If it's a child, it's fine, but as for adults, they're just watching from afar haha."" EA: I see. Dobermans and such are cool, but I don't want to keep one. CZ: I've heard that animal videos are very soothing lately; do you watch those? EA: I watch quite a lot. I watch a lot of cat videos and such. CZ: There are many videos, aren't there? Is that okay? EA: ""It's very soothing, you know. Like cats playing with each other. Or people making cat towers with DIY."" CZ: ""I see, it's an amateur video."" EA: ""Well, I often watch it on YouTube."" CZ: What other animal videos are there? EA: I only watch cat videos, so I'm not sure, but I think there are various things. Like filming a desert watering hole all day. CZ: The live footage of the desert waterhole sometimes shows animals coming to drink water. EA: That's right. I've seen short videos of ostriches and buffaloes coming. CZ: Oh, that's an incredibly valuable video. It's worth watching. EA: The idea of placing a camera in the desert is amazing, isn't it? CZ: ""I wonder who put it there. Maybe it's for observing wild animals."" EA: ""Speaking of fixed-point observation systems, there are also images of the Earth taken from space; did you know that?"" CZ: I've seen that before. I was really surprised by it. EA: It's unbelievable that we can now see from the perspective of space! The advancement of technology is amazing! CZ: The Earth was indeed spinning round and round! EA: ""Yes. The night view was beautiful, and I was moved by how it looked from outside."" CZ: That was beautiful too. The aurora was really captured. EA: Do you want to go to space? CZ: Well, it's a little scary. I'm worried about what I'll do if I can't come back. EA: Certainly, that might be the case, but I want to go! CZ: You have a spirit of adventure."
11,"EA: Hello! CZ: Thank you in advance! EA: What are you planning to eat for lunch? CZ: I plan to eat somen again. EA: Was it somen for breakfast too? CZ: Breakfast was somen noodles. EA: ""It's simple and nice, right? Somen noodles. I am thinking of eating curry."" CZ: How sweet do you like your curry? EA: I like it just a little bit spicy. CZ: It's the same. I prefer it to be slightly sweeter than medium-spicy. EA: If it's too spicy, I can't eat it because I'm not good with spicy food. Have you ever tried soup curry? CZ: It's the one with more liquid than regular curry, right? EA: Yes, I believe so. I have never eaten it myself, but I saw it in a video and it looked very delicious. CZ: I wonder if it tastes good, doesn't it look like it might be bland? EA: ""The flavor seems to be quite good. Well, I haven't eaten it, so I don't really know! It had a lot of vegetables in it as well."" CZ: It's nice that it has vegetables in it. Do you like eating unusual kinds of curry? EA: It's not that, but I just want to try eating the delicious-looking food I saw in the video! CZ: ""There are also food videos, right? What looked the most delicious?"" EA: I'm torn. When I saw a cheese-loaded pizza in high definition, I thought I wanted to eat it. CZ: The pizza looks delicious and its colors seem like they would stand out on the screen. EA: ""I saw it in a cooking video where they were making it in a foreign country. The way they filmed it was really good."" CZ: When I see it being made in a foreign kitchen, it somehow looks delicious. EA: Right. If you see authentic American hamburgers, you'll get hungry. Do you like meat dishes? CZ: I like meat. I often just grill it and eat it as it is. EA: Everyone loves it, right? What do you usually order a lot of at the yakiniku restaurant? CZ: Recently, I only eat beef occasionally and often eat pork and chicken. EA: I see. I also often eat chicken. There's a specialty shop nearby. CZ: It seems good to have various things nearby. EA: I guess the only thing is that there's no place to play. CZ: That's unfortunate!"
12,"EA: Hello! EP: Hello!! EA: Have you ever been to the city? EP: Yes, I do! I live in the Kanto region, so I go there sometimes. EA: I see! I went there once on a school trip, and I was surprised by how many people there were. EP: Oh! Where did you go? EA: ""I went to Tokyo and Hokkaido. I toured around the university!"" EP: Oh! I’m also from Kyushu, and I went to Okinawa and Hokkaido for middle school and high school. EA: Okinawa is nice! I have never been there. EP: Did you come to Tokyo for your school trip? EA: That's right! How was Okinawa? EP: Okinawa was great. The sea was very beautiful, and I played a lot. EA: It sounds like fun! Did you go skiing in Hokkaido? EP: I did it! I spent my time skiing. I got a snowburn! It was painful. EA: I remember feeling that way too! Did you get to eat something delicious? EP: I ate it! It was crab! Speaking of a trip to Hokkaido, did you fly to Hokkaido after Tokyo? EA: ""That's right. It was 2 days in Tokyo and 2 days in Hokkaido."" EP: Amazing!!!! It's insanely hard! EA: Yes, yes. I went around autumn, and I was surprised to see that Hokkaido was covered in snow. Also, the Jingisukan (grilled mutton) was delicious. EP: Amazing! Truly amazing. Cheers to the teachers' choice. Genghis Khan is nice. I've never had it before. EA: Since it was cooked in a strange container, it was memorable. The meat and vegetables were excellent! What was there in Okinawa? EP: Okinawa is a bit vague in my memory, but I think it was soki soba. I don't remember the taste either. But I want to go there again. EA: Sounds good, I want to go there someday too! Have you traveled recently? EP: I recently took a trip! I went to Osaka! EA: ""Osaka? It seems like there's a lot of delicious food in Osaka too!"" EP: That's right! But, I couldn't eat at all. EA: ""Is that so? Have you been busy?"" EP: Because there were children, it ended up being very hectic. It was tough! EA: I see, would you like to go again when your child gets older? EP: I want to go!!!!!!!!!"
