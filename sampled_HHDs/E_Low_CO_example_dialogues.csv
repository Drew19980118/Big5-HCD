CN: I am reading a book on health management. CO: Oh, that's interesting. CN: Lately, I've been feeling unwell more often. CO: I see. Has it not been managed until now? CN: I haven't done much. CO: Was it due to an unhealthy lifestyle? CN: I think the biggest factor is that commuting has decreased due to COVID-19, and thus my level of physical activity has decreased. CO: I see. Are you doing something now? CN: I try to walk for about 30 minutes. CO: Sounds good. I'm doing it too. CN: Have you decided on a course? CO: Yes, there is a park, and it has been decided that it will be held there. CN: Sounds good. Our house is near the road. CO: I see. How far do you walk? CN: It is about 1 to 2 kilograms. CO: That’s good. Continuing is important, isn’t it? CN: I see. I feel like I sleep well when I exercise. CO: Certainly, I feel that too. CN: If I don't leave the house, I don't sleep well. CO: Is it good to get moderately tired? CN: I feel the need to move my body. CO: Talking about this kind of thing motivates me. CN: When you realize that there are other people doing it, right!"
2,"CO: Good morning! CN: Good morning! CO: Do you like watching sports? CN: I like it! I often watch baseball. CO: Is that so? High school baseball has started. CN: ""It has started. My home prefecture lost early on."" CO: I see, is the opponent a strong team? CN: They are a strong team. It was worth watching. CO: ""Do you actually go to see it?"" CN: ""I used to go watch professional baseball games."" CO: I see, that sounds good, the stadium. CN: Baseball is fun, and recently you can also enjoy ballpark gourmet food. CO: I don't know about ballpark food. CN: ""There is a menu produced by the athlete."" CO: Oh, that sounds interesting. I didn't know because I haven't been there recently. CN: The favorite foods of that athlete and local specialties are featured. CO: Do you have any recommendations? CN: It changes every season, but the karaage bowl was delicious.

CO: I often watch the matches of Japanese athletes overseas. CN: ""Overseas ones are really impressive, aren't they? Japanese ones are also great, though."" CO: Yes, but the match is in the middle of the night, which is tough. I end up sleep-deprived. CN: I see, there's a time difference."
3,"CO: Good morning! CQ: Good morning. CO: What time did you wake up today? CQ: It is 5 AM. CO: You're early. Is it always like this? CQ: The workplace is far, so it's always this time. CO: How long does it take to get to your workplace? CQ: In the morning, it takes 2 hours and 10 minutes, and on the way back, it takes about 2 hours and 30 to 2 hours and 50 minutes. CO: ""That's amazing. It will become faster."" CQ: ""Yes, I'm very sleepy."" CO: ""Do you commute by car?"" CQ: No, it's the train. CO: I see. If you have that time, it seems like you could use it for something. CQ: Yes, I want to devote more time to sleep. CO: Are you considering moving nearby? CQ: Yes, I would like to do it right away, but I am waiting for my family's approval. CO: I see. You can't move right away. CQ: Sure, how about you? CO: I am close. CQ: How long will it take? CO: I will arrive within 20 minutes. By bicycle. CQ: That's close. CO: If it's hypothetically 2 hours from my place, it would be out of the prefecture, right? It's a bit tough. CQ: From the west side of Saitama, it proceeds into Tokyo. CO: I see. They had a show like that on TV Tokyo, didn't they? How long does it take to get home? CQ: ""Is there such a program? How was the content?"" CO: It was interesting. Everyone had their own reasons for attending. CQ: Did you all have a long commute? CO: I feel like three hours was easy. CQ: ""Wow, that's amazing."""
4,"CO: Good morning. CQ: Good morning. CO: Did you eat breakfast? CQ: I ate it! CO: What do you always eat? Breakfast CQ: ""Leftovers from dinner or instant food, I guess."" CO: What is retort? Rice? CQ: Curry, beef bowl, things you heat up in the microwave. CO: Are you a rice person in the morning? CQ: ""Well, I eat whatever is available, but it seems to change depending on my mood."" CO: I see, I prefer bread. Rice is too heavy. CQ: I see, something light in the morning is good, isn't it? CO: Yes, I'm fine with ochazuke. CQ: I understand how you feel, ochazuke and plain rice are different. CO: ""Is that so? Do you like bread?"" CQ: I like you. CO: What kind of bread is it? CQ: Hmm, I like anything as long as it is edible. CO: I see, I've been really into Sanmi lately. Do you know what that is? CQ: I'm sorry, this is the first time I've heard of it. CO: ""Is it only in Kansai? Maybe it's Yamazaki Bread. It's chocolate bread."" CQ: ""Heh, chocolate bread, huh? Is there chocolate inside?"" CO: Yes, it is surrounded by three colors of chocolate. CQ: It's colorful. CO: Yes, recently a four-color version called Yonmee has been released. CQ: Did you eat? CO: I ate. I was excited. CQ: Is it really that delicious? CO: No, the taste was no different from Sanmi. CQ: ""I'm curious, so I'll check it out!"""
5,"CO: Good morning. CQ: Good morning. CO: Do you like sports? CQ: I'm not very good at it. CO: Did you participate in any club activities during your student days? CQ: I was playing table tennis. CO: Sounds good. Do you watch the Olympics or table tennis? CQ: I don't watch the Olympics. CO: I see. Don't you watch it? CQ: Yes, it looks cool, so I want to see it. CO: ""Ping pong also requires quick reflexes."" CQ: Yes, Olympic athletes are quick in their movements. CO: How about you? CQ: I'm not very good at it. CO: I see. Why did you join the table tennis club? CQ: ""I don't have any other sports I'm interested in, so it's out of habit."" CO: Out of habit. Was there no option for cultural clubs? CQ: The culture club was full of women, so it was difficult to join. CO: I see. In that case, it would be like that. CQ: Do you like sports? CO: Yes, I just went for a run earlier. CQ: ""That's aggressive, is it a habit?"" CO: I'm thinking I want to make it a habit. CQ: You're not running every day, are you? Do you have a favorite sport? CO: Not every day. About two days a week. I like soccer. CQ: I see, are there many people around you who also like sports? CO: I was with my previous company for a long time and was allowed to join the team. CQ: I see, it's the complete opposite around me. CO: I see, exercising from time to time is good for your body. Please do it. CQ: Alright, I'll give it a try."
6,"CO: Good morning! AS: Good morning! CO: What time do you usually wake up in the morning? AS: The morning is at 5 o'clock. CO: ""That was quick. Is it related to your work?"" AS: It's to water the vegetables! CO: Are you growing vegetables? That's amazing. AS: I am growing it in a university class! CO: Isn't it tough growing vegetables in the summer heat? AS: It's quite tough, but watching the vegetables grow quickly is enjoyable. CO: Sounds good. What kind of vegetables are they? AS: Sweet potatoes, soybeans, and four kinds of summer vegetables. CO: ""There are many kinds, aren't there? Are you growing them for research purposes or something?"" AS: ""It is related to learning about genetic engineering technology."" CO: Oh, that looks difficult. AS: It is a technology where the genes of insect-resistant plants are incorporated into vegetables that one wants to grow, resulting in vegetables with those characteristics. CO: ""Heh, I'm sure it will benefit both producers and consumers. Thank you for your hard work."" AS: It is not yet common in Japan, but I believe it is an industry that will grow in the future. CO: I see, is that kind of technology already being used in the vegetables being sold now? AS: It seems that it is quite often used as an ingredient in processed foods. CO: Oh, really? I didn't know that. AS: Overseas, they are being produced in large quantities and are included in imported products made from corn and soybeans. CO: When I was overseas in the past, I saw vegetables that were clearly larger than usual. AS: That might also be genetically modified. CO: I see. I thought you were doing something amazing. AS: However, the larger it gets, the weaker the taste becomes, so that's a drawback. CO: I see, do they also make the flavor stronger or change the color in Japan? AS: ""I haven't heard of it, but there are vegetables designed to enhance nutritional value."" CO: I see, thank you for the informative talk. AS: Thank you very much!"
7,"CO: Good morning! AS: Good morning! CO: Do you have any favorite foods? AS: I love meat! CO: ""That’s nice, is it beef?"" AS: Basically, all of them are good, but the one I eat the most is pork. CO: I see, how do you eat it? AS: Pork belly is used for stir-fries and meat rolls, and larger cuts are used for dishes like tonkatsu. CO: Sounds good. Do you cook? AS: I cook every time! CO: Wonderful. I like ginger pork. AS: I love it too! CO: You can eat a lot of rice, right? AS: It progresses a lot. CO: Do you like grilled meat? AS: We do it once every two months! CO: ""Which part do you like? Beef."" AS: A cow's tongue is called 'tan'. CO: ""Delicious, isn't it? I have harami."" AS: I like harami too! Also, things like kalbi. CO: Sounds good. Do you eat something like cold noodles after having grilled meat? AS: The only side dish I eat is soup. CO: ""Is it just meat?"" AS: It's just meat. CO: Wonderful. How about dessert? AS: Oh, I will eat dessert!! CO: ""It feels refreshing, doesn't it?"" AS: ""I'm eating things like almond tofu."" CO: ""Sounds good. It's a classic."" AS: It's very delicious."
8,"CO: Good morning! AS: Good morning! CO: Do you watch TV? AS: I haven't watched TV at all. CO: Do you watch things like the internet or videos? AS: It looks really messy. CO: I see, what kind of things do you watch? AS: ""It's commentary at a leisurely pace or educational content."" CO: I see, is it YouTube? AS: ""That's right. Oh, and I also watch NicoNico."" CO: I see, what kind of study materials are they? AS: ""I'm looking at fields I'm not good at or subjects I don't know."" CO: You're a diligent student. It's great that you can learn from videos these days. AS: It’s convenient because I don't have to go to the bookstore. CO: Certainly. When I start something, I study in advance with videos. AS: That way, you'll grasp it faster, right? CO: Yes, that is very helpful. AS: I'm the same. CO: By looking before shopping, I feel like I have fewer failures. AS: ""Is this a video related to shopping?"" CO: Yes, it's an introduction video. AS: ""I haven't seen it before. Is a woman doing it?"" CO: No, it's for both men and women. They are review videos about trying out or using products. AS: I see. That helps a lot. CO: Yes, if it's something that everyone has, it's usually reviewed. Things like electronic products and clothes. AS: I regret it a lot when I buy something and it turns out to be not so good. CO: That's right. Since it's generally something I would recommend, careful consideration is indeed necessary. AS: I see. I think I need to listen to various people's stories and consider them. CO: Sometimes it's overwhelming with all the information. I'll watch videos to prepare for the summer sales. AS: I will also do my best to make good purchases."
9,"CO: Good morning! AS: Good morning! CO: What do you do on your days off? AS: On my days off, I play games. CO: Do you have a favorite game? AS: ""Pokémon and Smash Bros."" CO: Do you like games? AS: I love it! CO: ""Is that a switch? I'm not very knowledgeable about it."" AS: ""That's right! It's a Nintendo game!"" CO: I want it, but I don't know what kind of software is available. It's expensive, right? AS: What kind of games do you like? CO: ""About the only thing I play on the PlayStation is Winning Eleven."" AS: I see, maybe it's a sports game. CO: Yes, I like it and have been doing it for a long time. AS: There aren't many serious ones, but there are such games with Mario. CO: I see. Has the price of the main unit gone up now? AS: The main unit's production has stabilized and the price is standard. There might be a summer vacation sale. CO: I see, I'll try aiming for the sale. AS: For games that don't require intense movements or if you don't need to connect to the TV, I recommend the Lite. CO: ""Is the Lite a bit cheaper? I might want to connect it to the TV."" AS: The price will be about 2/3. CO: I see. Is secondhand suspicious? AS: I think they are properly checking the operation, so I believe it's okay even if it's used! CO: ""Okay, I'll try aiming for that. It seems to be quite inexpensive."" AS: Certainly. I wanted a brand new one and spent a little over 30,000 yen, but that might be more economical. CO: I see, around 30,000. Is it light? AS: No, the one that connects to the TV. CO: I see, that's how it is. On the site, it felt like it was very expensive. Normally, it's about that much, isn't it? AS: ""That's originally the case! Maybe they're aiming for a higher return rate and driving up the price."""
10,"CO: Good morning! AS: Good morning! CO: Do you have a favorite snack? AS: I like Country Ma'am! CO: Sounds good, what flavor is it? AS: I like cocoa, but recently there have been various things coming out. CO: I also eat it often. I guess it's a classic. AS: I think it's a classic! The quantity has decreased significantly compared to the past. CO: ""It has decreased, hasn't it? I feel like all snacks are decreasing."" AS: ""It decreases quietly and before you know it."" CO: There must be a lot going on. Prices are also going up. AS: However, I think the price increase notice for Garigari-kun was very well done. CO: Sure. Do you often eat ice cream? AS: You eat a lot of ice cream lately. CO: ""Is it Garigari-kun?"" AS: No, it's Pino! CO: ""It's delicious. I haven't eaten it recently."" AS: If I had a car, I would buy things like Garigari-kun, but it's a bit far to my house and they melt. CO: Does it feel like there are no stores nearby? AS: There's nothing nearby~ Even at the shortest, it takes about 15 minutes by bicycle. CO: I see, if that's the case, it can't be helped. AS: If it's Pino, I can quickly eat it while I'm out, so I've been buying it a lot recently. CO: How many pieces are in the box of Pino? AS: I believe it was six. CO: Is the number the same as before? AS: I don't think it has been reduced! But it does feel slightly smaller somehow. CO: I see, it's being gradually whittled down. Do you remember ""Pino"" from the old Famista game? AS: I just checked, and it seems like it hasn't been reduced since its release! Well, I'm not sure. CO: ""Aren't you cutting down? You are considerate of consumers."" AS: It's amazing, isn't it?"
11,"CO: Good morning. CA: Good morning. CO: What time do you wake up in the morning? CA: I usually wake up at 7 in the morning, but recently I've been trying to wake up at 5. How about you, <CO>? CO: ""That's early. I usually wake up before 7."" CA: I am currently training myself to become an early riser. CO: Are you getting up early for work? CA: For the sake of my health, I make sure to take on work because if I have a job, I feel obligated to get up so as not to inconvenience others. CO: If there is a reason, I can wake up early. CA: That's right. If I don't have work, I love sleep so much that I end up sleeping until the last minute. CO: I understand. Do you take it easy on your days off? CA: Even on my days off, I used to take it easy, but recently my body has gotten used to it, and I've started waking up early. CO: It has become a habit, hasn't it? What do you eat for breakfast? CA: ""In the morning, it's rice and miso soup, right? What about you, <CO>?"" CO: It is bread. CA: ""Bread is nice, isn't it? What kind of bread do you usually eat?"" CO: ""It's butter on toast. And also yogurt."" CA: Butter on toast is the best, isn't it? How many slices do you prefer? CO: ""There are 6 slices. They are a bit thin. Do you eat bread?"" CA: In the morning, I eat rice, but I also love bread! CO: ""You eat a lot in the morning, don't you? I don't need that much."" CA: I heard somewhere that eating small meals is good. CO: I see. Do you eat fruit in the morning? CA: I eat bananas as a snack. How about you, <CO>? CO: I put blueberries in my yogurt. CA: ""Sounds good! Is it live?"" CO: It is frozen. Occasionally, I also add bananas. CA: If you use it like that while it's frozen, it'll be great! Looks delicious! Especially in this season, I appreciate something cold! CO: ""It's slightly frozen, and it keeps you awake. I recommend it."" CA: I like blueberries, so I'd like to buy some and try it! Let's talk again!"
12,"CO: Hello! CA: Hello! CO: What do you usually do on your days off? CA: On my days off, I take care of my plants, watch TV, and play games. How about you, <CO>? CO: I feel the same way. Do you keep houseplants? CA: I love it! There is also a rubber tree beside me now. Do you also like houseplants, <CO>? CO: I like greenery, but it's difficult. Do you cut it when it grows? CA: There are also many easy-to-grow ones. It's been years since I couldn't bring myself to prune them because I felt sorry for them. CO: I'm wondering what to do because the pachira's leaves are overgrown. CA: Wow!! You're growing a Pachira plant! I have one too. And I have the same problem with the leaves growing too thick! CO: ""It's troubling. I'm wondering if it's better to repot it."" CA: How long has it been since you purchased it? CO: It's about half a year. CA: If that's the case, I think it's still okay! CO: ""I see, it looks cramped. The cactus quickly grew big, so I repotted it."" CA: If it looks cramped, that might be another problem! You have a cactus too, don't you? What kind of cactus is it? CO: It's an Opuntia cactus. Do you know what etiolation is? CA: It's a cute cactus that really feels like a cactus, isn't it! Does etiolated mean you're growing it indoors? CO: Yes, I have been snipped off by that many times. CA: Wow! I have never pruned a cactus before! What should I be careful about when cutting it? CO: ""I disinfect the scissors and then do it on sunny days as much as possible. I failed when I pruned mini tomatoes in the past."" CA: It's a sunny day for disinfection! My plants are also growing too tall, but I'm scared they might wither, so I haven't been able to do it. CO: ""It's quite important, isn't it? Recently, I received a plant of okawakame. Do you know okawakame?"" CA: ""I've only heard the name. What kind of plant is it?"" CO: When you eat the leaves, they taste like seaweed. CA: Wow! It's a vegetable that tastes like wakame! CO: Yes, they are growing vigorously in the summer. Although I usually let them wither, they are quite resilient. CA: I think <CO> is really good at growing them! I'm curious! I want to try eating them too! CO: It's delicious. Growing things you can eat expands the enjoyment. CA: Oka wakame, I definitely want to try growing it next year too! Thank you for giving me something to look forward to!"
