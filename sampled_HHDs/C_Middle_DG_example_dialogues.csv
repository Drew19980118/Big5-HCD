1,"DG: Good evening. BA: Good evening! DG: Were you okay with the typhoon yesterday? BA: I was okay! How about you? DG: It was okay, but when the rain stopped, the cicadas started a grand chorus. BA: Interesting DG: You're so noisy! BA: It's noisy, isn't it? DG: This month is already halfway over in the blink of an eye. BA: It's true, isn't it! Did you do anything summery? DG: No, I've been staying home a lot! Did you go somewhere? BA: The sea and the pool, I guess. DG: It's an incredible summer, isn't it? Did you get a tan? BA: It's doing it repeatedly. DG: Oh, I'm not good at it because I get really red. I'm envious. BA: I see! DG: Yes, but the sunlight is really strong this year. BA: Are you doing UV care? DG: I'm applying it just in case, but I'm worried about how effective it is. BA: You don't understand, right? DG: Yes, I got a little tan. BA: It's completely impossible, isn't it? DG: ""Yes. I admire tanned skin."" BA: ""Is that so? It will get covered in stains!"" DG: There are already spots on my arm! BA: Oh! Can people who blush also get spots? DG: Somehow I turn red for a moment and then remain without realizing it. BA: That's unpleasant. DG: I need to be careful! Thank you very much. BA: Thank you very much."
2,"DG: Nice to meet you. BA: Nice to meet you. DG: Is there anything you've been into recently? BA: Hmmm, I wonder, who are you? DG: ""Maybe things like watching movies."" BA: I like it too! What have you watched recently? DG: I went to see the new One Piece release. BA: You watch anime too, right? DG: I see. At home, we watch a lot of Western movies. BA: I also like Western movies. DG: Do you have any favorite works or actors? BA: I like Ryan Gosling. DG: What were you in? My memory is vague. BA: ""The Notebook for you!"" DG: Oh! Are you from La La Land? BA: That's right! DG: ""That actor is great, isn't he? I also liked the role he played in 'Kimi ni Yomu'."" BA: ""That's nice! Who is the person you like?"" DG: ""Old Johnny Depp."" BA: ""When was it aired?"" DG: Hmm. I like a movie called ""Chocolat"". BA: Is it no good recently? DG: It's not that it's bad, but I liked it when he teamed up with Tim Burton. BA: I see. DG: ""Recently there haven't been many interesting new releases, so it's mostly Prime."" BA: I am Netflix. DG: Netflix originals have increased! BA: ""It has increased quite a lot, hasn't it? We can't keep up."" DG: ""That's true. It's a convenient world."" BA: It’s true, isn’t it?"
3,"DG: Good evening! BA: Good evening DG: Do you listen to music? BA: I listen to Western music. DG: ""You listen to Western music! That's cool."" BA: You are DG: I might have a lot of Japanese music! The names that come to mind are. BA: What songs do you often listen to? DG: ""I have been listening to L'Arc-en-Ciel for a long time, and I also like King Gnu."" BA: ""I don't understand that stuff at all."" DG: I see. What kind of Western music? BA: ""Famous ones include Justin Bieber."" DG: Absolutely listening! BA: Have you heard of it? DG: ""I have it, but I don't know the song title. It's famous, right?"" BA: It's quite famous. DG: Although it's difficult to go to live concerts recently, have you ever been to one? BA: I've been there, but it was quite a while ago. DG: Amazing! I have the impression that it's not easy to see international artists. BA: It's quite easy to buy. Did you go to a live show recently? DG: ""Is that so? No, I am planning to attend Summer Sonic for the first time in a while."" BA: ""Isn't Summer Sonic coming up soon?"" DG: ""Next week, I'm worried if everyone will be able to go out because of COVID-19."" BA: I wonder who the overseas artist is. DG: THE19 somehow! BA: Hmm, I don't know that person... DG: ""I've always been bad with historical eras and got sloppy."" BA: It's related to era names, right? DG: ""I couldn't go past 19. Thank you!"" BA: LOL Thank you."
4,"DG: Nice to meet you! DV: Nice to meet you, hello. DG: Have you been into anything lately? DV: ""Watching quiz shows at home!"" DG: ""I see quiz shows often these days. They seem educational."" DV: I thought it might be good for brain activation. DG: Certainly. In fact, even elementary school problems seem difficult. DV: I understand! Even though I studied, I don't remember anything at all. DG: That's right! While saying ""Did you do such a thing?"", they are watching. DV: I am worried that I might be overtaken by my child soon. DG: ""Ahaha, it seems like you have a sense of urgency when you have children!"" DV: If someone said to me ""You don't even understand this?"", I would be so shocked that I wouldn't be able to sleep. DG: I feel so frustrated that I want to bury myself in my textbooks. Me too. DV: But we gradually forget things that we don't use regularly, don't we? DG: That's right. By the way, what was your favorite subject? DV: I liked mathematics. DG: Oh! Completely the opposite! DV: ""I liked the part where there is a definitive answer!"" DG: Oh, people who like math do say that. It might indeed be fair. DV: ""In Japanese language subjects, the answers are ambiguous or vary depending on the grader."" DG: Certainly. You could say that, and there is also that perspective. DV: I feel like there are a lot of ""this isn't wrong either, but..."" situations. DG: Yes, I liked reading books, so I enjoyed thinking deeply about various things there. DV: I also used to love reading books! During my student days, I would often spend a lot of time in the library. DG: I understand. Recently it has decreased, but I was not good at classical literature and such. DV: Classical Japanese was certainly difficult. DG: ""I quickly got bored with kanji drills too. There seem to be a lot of interesting learning materials now."" DV: There are various types of drills nowadays, aren't there? DG: As I think it sounds fun, I am listening to my friend who has become a mother. DV: I need to buy one for the kids soon."
5,"DG: Hello! DV: Hello! DG: What time does ""good evening"" start? DV: The evening news is at 5 PM or 6 PM, right? DG: Ah, I definitely wasn't considering that criterion! DV: I feel like it was around 5 PM. DG: ""I suddenly thought that it's always 'hello' overseas."" DV: Japanese is definitely difficult, isn't it? DG: Because it is so detailed in various ways, it is difficult for those learning. DV: A single way of speaking can change the impression. DG: There are too many homophones, I'm about to burst. DV: It seems difficult for foreigners to learn Japanese. DG: I was happy when I was told that the sound was clear while talking on the phone in Japanese when I was overseas. DV: You've been abroad, right? Which country did you go to? DG: I have stayed with a host family in Australia. DV: ""I'm longing for a homestay!"" DG: As an only child, it was refreshing for me to have siblings. DV: Is it long-term? Or short-term? DG: High school was non-stop. I was severely homesick. DV: Sure, at first it's fun, but as it goes on, I feel like I'll want to go home. DG: Yes, and the food is different, so that made me feel lonely. DV: Did you start missing rice? DG: I started to miss Japanese food, like fish! It's been all meat! DV: Is it true that despite being surrounded by the ocean, Australia has more meat? DG: There was a lot of Aussie beef and lamb steak. DV: Both Aussie beef and lamb steak are often mentioned, and they look delicious. DG: Since it had low fat content, I lost quite a bit of weight when I came back! DV: It's healthy, isn't it? It's both good and bad. DG: I see, it's a bit dry. It was interesting. DV: Thank you for sharing your valuable experience!"
6,"DG: Hello, please. DV: ""I look forward to working with you as well."" DG: Do you have any favorite artists or celebrities? DV: When I was young, I liked GLAY. DG: It's nostalgic! I wonder if they're still doing live performances. DV: It seems they do it occasionally in Hokkaido, but I wonder how it is nationwide. DG: I see, it's nice to have a local focus. DV: ""Well, they were doing a large-scale concert in Hokkaido before."" DG: Do you go to live concerts? DV: ""I specialize in DVDs."" DG: That might look better that way. DV: I just couldn't keep up with that level of excitement. DG: I see! Each artist has quite a distinct style, don't they? DV: I once went to see a female artist's concert, and I was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the crowd around me. DG: Oh! Is it the passion of men? DV: Both men and women, there's an incredible atmosphere like LOVE! DG: Ah, I see, it's like an idol thing, right? I'm not really good with that kind of stuff either. DV: ""Do I feel like I'm the only one left out? Since then, I've just been watching DVDs."" DG: I see. There was a time when I was suddenly taken to a Yuzu concert and couldn't keep up with the dazzling atmosphere. DV: The image of Yuzu's live concert doesn't seem to be full of screaming fans. DG: It's really skillful, but I thought it was amazing how they were jumping, hopping, and dancing around so energetically! DV: I see, I wonder if all artists' live performances are like that. DG: I see. I'd like to go to something where I can sit and listen calmly. DV: That's right, if it's a live performance where I can sit and listen, I want to go! DG: I am not good with the pressure of having to stand up. Participation is voluntary! DV: ""If everyone around is standing, I can't be the only one sitting, you know."" DG: That's right. I think that even though I'm cheering and enjoying it. DV: After all, it seems that a dedicated DVD player is better. DG: Ahaha, it might be perfect given the times. DV: That's really true!"
7,"DG: Hello! DV: Hello! DG: It's hot, and I feel like going to the aquarium. DV: I want to get splashed by the dolphin show! DG: ""That's nice! There was a report about dolphins coming to the sea, right?"" DV: Come to think of it, I saw that kind of news report. DG: It seems like there was a child who got bitten a little at the beach. DV: It seems some people were bitten, right? They have a cute image, but they're scary. DG: I heard that they are mischievous but powerful. DV: Certainly, because their body is large, even a slight force might cause an injury, right? DG: Sure, but that jump is impressive and really worth watching! DV: There used to be an event at the local aquarium where you could touch dolphins, and it was cute. DG: Sure, sounds good! What does it feel like? DV: I feel like it was smooth. DG: ""I see, they look kind of muscular because they can fly so much, don't they?"" DV: It seems there was also a feeding experience, but it was a pity that I couldn't do it because the timing didn't match. DG: I wish I could try it since I've never experienced it before. DV: It was a rare experience, so it's still a good memory even now. DG: I often like to cool off by getting chills while watching the shark tank. DV: Sharks are scary, but I heard that some species are gentle. DG: I like hammerhead sharks. I'm interested in why their heads became like that. DV: Is it the square-looking one? DG: My friends call me a vacuum cleaner! DV: Ahaha, excellent naming sense! DG: Yes, that's right. I get teased, but that's also cute. DV: My child often says they like whale sharks. DG: That's a big and gentle shark! I've never seen one, so I want to see it. DV: I've seen it before at the aquarium in Okinawa, and it was wonderful. DG: ""It's the Churaumi Aquarium, right? I want to visit."" DV: I recommend it!"
8,"DG: Nice to meet you! DV: Nice to meet you, hello. DG: Recently, I've had fewer opportunities to go out and haven't bought any clothes. Did you buy any? DV: I bought pants through online shopping. DG: After all, online shopping has increased, hasn't it? For me, it's mostly Uniqlo. DV: You can cut the hem yourself and adjust the length. DG: Eh! Is that so? I didn't know there was such a service. DV: The pants are made of a material that doesn't fray even if you cut them, so you can cut them yourself. DG: I see! That's convenient! It seems like you can do various things. DV: Since my height is not that tall, the hem inevitably ends up being too long. DG: I also dislike getting dirty from things on the ground. DV: Rainy days are the worst, right? DG: ""That's right. Only the hem fades."" DV: When I was young, I used to wear heels and high-heeled boots. DG: Speaking of which, I've been wearing comfortable shoes recently. DV: I've also been wearing sneakers a lot lately, and I can't help but be concerned about the hem. DG: That's right! There are many sports-type sneakers and sandals. DV: I learned about the existence of pants that can be hemmed by yourself at such times. DG: I see, there are people who develop various things. DV: Found it and immediately clicked. DG: Ahaha, it's great, isn't it! When you say ""That's exactly what I was looking for!"" DV: As soon as it arrived, I tried it on and found that the fabric was perfect for this season, and it was comfortable to wear. DG: ""Well, I'm thinking of looking for it. I just have this urge to buy some clothes."" DV: It was so good that I ended up buying it again in a different color. DG: Amazing! That raises my expectations. I hope you find a favorite. DV: I'm thinking of wearing those pants a lot this summer. DG: Sounds good, I’ve been wearing skirts all the time recently, so I’ll look for some! DV: I think you can find it if you search for it, so I highly recommend it. DG: Thank you for the valuable information! DV: No, no, you're welcome!"
9,"DG: Good evening! DV: Good evening! DG: I've been staying up late recently. Should I go to bed early? DV: When I was putting the child to sleep, I fell asleep without realizing it. DG: I see, having a family around seems to help establish that rhythm! DV: ""I try to put them to bed at 9 PM, so they usually fall asleep around that time."" DG: Fast! It seems to be good for the skin! DV: But in reality, I want to enjoy some time for myself after the kids go to bed. DG: I see, that's right. It must be tough to be constantly chased. DV: The TV channels are constantly being taken over by the kids. DG: I see, indeed. Give mom some free time! DV: I want time to watch TV leisurely. DG: It seems like that might happen. How would you spend a free day? DV: I might either go shopping slowly or just zone out. DG: I see. Since I am single, when I think about it like that, it seems like it must be tough for parents. DV: From the moment a child is born, there may be no such thing as a free day, so it might be tough. DG: That's right, you will become somewhat distant from friends who have just become mothers. DV: That's right, it's quite difficult to leave the kids and go out, and taking them along is also challenging. DG: I hear that the time slots and choices are completely different from when you were single. DV: Going out to eat also ends up being at places that cater to children, doesn't it? DG: I see, it seems like choosing a shop on Twitter and such can be quite difficult. DV: Since we go to eat what the children want to eat, we don't go to Italian places much. DG: I see, so it will end up being a family restaurant type of place, right? DV: That's right, it tends to be more family restaurant chains. DG: I see, I have to eat spicy foods while I still can. DV: I think conveyor belt sushi is also good for kids who like sushi, but my kid doesn't eat sushi. DG: I see! There might also be preferences and allergies. DV: You should eat as much of what you like as you can while you still can! DG: I will follow what the senior mom says. Let's eat mapo tofu! DV: Haha, that's great!"
10,"DG: Nice to meet you, please take care of me. DV: Thank you in advance! DG: It's really hot today, isn't it? DV: Just going outside really makes me sweat. DG: I was surprised to see that the outside temperature was 40 degrees. DV: Is it 40 degrees? It's just like being in a bath. DG: ""That's true. Did you have lunch?"" DV: I ate ramen today. DG: Ramen on a hot day! What does it taste like? DV: Handmade with soy sauce flavor. DG: ""Is it handmade? If it's soy sauce, it should be good even in summer!"" DV: ""I like to put in a lot of onions."" DG: ""Oh, it looks delicious. Is it finely chopped?"" DV: Onions are thinly sliced, and finely chopped green onions are added later. DG: I love dishes with lots of green onions. That sounds great. DV: I feel like green onions are good for summer fatigue. DG: That sounds good! I always end up eating instant noodles. DV: I also occasionally eat cup noodles, but I still prefer homemade food. DG: That seems to be better for your health. It has quite a bit of salt after all. DV: Cup noodles have a lot of salt, don't they? DG: ""That's right. I often eat spicy food, but if I continue, my body feels heavy."" DV: ""If you make it yourself, you can use more vegetables, and it's great."" DG: I see! I'm thinking of having noodles tonight. DV: When you don't have an appetite, it's nice to be able to eat something smooth, isn't it? DG: ""That's right. Rice and bread somehow require power."" DV: If you just have noodles, you can add meat and vegetables to it, so you don't need any other side dishes, which is convenient. DG: Certainly, it's convenient and nice because it can be done with one plate. DV: I highly recommend noodles on summer nights! DG: I will refer to it! DV: Yes!"
11,"DG: Hello! DV: Hello! DG: Lately, I've been spending a lot of time at home and becoming less active. DV: Ah, I understand! I also gained weight due to a lack of exercise. DG: Great! Do you do any gymnastics or yoga? DV: It's not doing anything, even though I think I should do something. DG: I feel a sense of familiarity. I watch the videos, but that's the end of it. DV: Ah, I have bought it before too! DG: DVDs were popular, right? DV: ""I watched it once, tried it a bit, and that was it."" DG: ""Same here. Even though we have YouTube now, I just watch that and it's over."" DV: That's right, there are various things now, aren't there? DG: Yes, I did something like simple stretches before bed for a week, was satisfied with that, and forgot about it the following week. DV: ""Things that can be done in one minute or just 5 minutes once a day"" DG: Yes, yes, but it doesn't last, right? I wonder how effective it is. DV: It seems easy and doable, but I really can't keep it up. DG: I once registered at a gym, but I got better at making excuses. DV: Jim, I thought it was nice, but I never registered. DG: It was quite expensive, and as infections increased, resistance emerged. DV: It's true that infections are scary right now. DG: Yes, there are also many older men who work out on machines while making quite a bit of noise. DV: It's difficult to do while wearing a mask, and being indoors is worrisome, isn't it? DG: I think I'm gradually becoming more and more of a neat freak. DV: I understand, if I touch something, I immediately feel the need to disinfect with alcohol. DG: That's right, I ended up buying a big spray. DV: ""It may not be very good in terms of immunity and resistance."" DG: I also feel that a lot. I wonder which is better for small children. DV: Children today have fewer opportunities to build their immunity, don't they? DG: Yes, that's right, there are so many disinfectants and antibacterial products here. DV: I hope the coronavirus will subside soon."
12,"DG: Hello! DV: Hello! DG: Do you like coffee? DV: I like it so much that I drink it every morning. DG: ""Morning coffee is nice, isn't it? I end up drinking too much."" DV: I also drink a PET bottle from the morning. DG: ""Right, black? Do you like it sweet?"" DV: Black is the only choice! DG: Oh! I can tell you really like coffee! DV: After all, black coffee feels the most like coffee. DG: ""Is it always a pet? Do you buy beans?"" DV: I used to buy beans and such, but gradually it became bothersome. DG: I see, I'm currently debating whether to buy a machine or not. DV: I also have a machine that brews coffee with capsules. DG: Oh, was it Nespresso? I think I've seen the booth. DV: ""It's convenient, but the maintenance is hard."" DG: Is that so? Are there quite a lot of parts to wash? DV: There were parts that could be washed and parts that couldn't, and I remember it being quite a hassle. DG: I see. There was quite a line at the booth so I couldn't do the tasting, but I thought it was cool. DV: I used it right after I bought it, but it became a hassle, so now it's sitting on the shelf. DG: Oh, I might have seen a future where the same thing happens. DV: It may be because I like iced coffee. DG: Is it difficult to make ice cream with that machine? DV: ""It's like extracting with a large amount of ice."" DG: Ah, it looks a bit troublesome. I'm worried. DV: If you are serving it to customers, that kind might be better. DG: Certainly, it seems like it would be appreciated, but it seems impractical for everyday use. DV: If it's just for myself, I'll choose the more convenient option. DG: I'm glad I asked! I think I'll reconsider! DV: I'm glad it was helpful."
