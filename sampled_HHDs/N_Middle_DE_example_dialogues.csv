1,"DE: Hello, nice to meet you. DD: Hello! Nice to meet you! DE: What did you have for lunch? DD: I haven't had lunch yet. I had a late breakfast. What did you have? DE: ""Oh, is that so? I had deli bread and supermarket takoyaki."" DD: ""Is it okay to ask what kind of savory bread it is?"" DE: It was a roll with cutlet and cabbage inside. It was delicious. DD: Wow, that looks delicious! Maybe I will have some bread too. DE: Do you like bread? What kind of bread do you want to eat? DD: You really like bread! Recently, I've been hooked on the loaf bread from a nearby bakery and eat it often! DE: It's delicious, isn't it? What kind of bread is it? DD: ""They are particular about the ingredients, so it's sweet and delicious even without adding anything."" DE: Recently, I feel like a lot of specialty bread shops have been opening. DD: Yes, that's right! I've been seeing it quite often recently! DE: I often see stores with long lines that sell out quickly, but I don't like waiting in line, so I haven't bought from them much. DD: I don't feel like buying something if I have to wait in line. I definitely won't wait in line for ramen either. DE: For some reason, people line up at the ramen shop. It's said that the neighborhood is relatively competitive when it comes to ramen. DD: I see! Do you like ramen? DE: I didn't like it much before, but I'm starting to like it because of my husband's influence. How about you? Do you like ramen? DD: I don't really feel like I have to eat ramen, but since my food preferences have been changing recently, I think I'll give it a try. DE: How about some somen or soba? DD: I prefer udon over soba, but among noodle dishes, ramen might be my least favorite. DE: Udon is delicious too. As for udon, I like Sanuki udon. DD: Sanuki udon is delicious, isn't it? I've started thinking udon would be great for lunch too! Haha. DE: ""Is it bread or udon? I guess it's wheat flour. Hahaha."" DD: ""Isn't it!! Maybe it's too much flour! I'll have rice for dinner! Haha."" DE: Recently, there's so much wheat flour in food that I sometimes wonder what it would be like to live without it. DD: Ah, but there was a period when I was influenced by my family to go gluten-free, and it was tough. DE: That's amazing. How was it difficult? DD: As you mentioned, it's hard to find food without wheat, it's expensive, and I have to cook it myself."
2,"DE: Hello. Nice to meet you! DD: Hello! Nice to meet you! DE: Is your family home nearby? DD: I live with my parents! DE: That's nice. When I go back to my hometown, it takes half a day to get there as it's a distant place. DD: I see! It's a case of wanting what you can't have, but sometimes I feel a bit envious of people who can go back to their hometown. DE: A friend who was born and raised in Kanto often says the same thing. DD: That's right! I'd like to do things like go back to my parents' house, take a short trip, or exchange things with each other. DE: ""Yes. It's a common issue when visiting home, but I have trouble choosing souvenirs."" DD: Certainly! What kind of things would make them happy? DE: Basically, it depends on the recipient, but parents are usually happier with something other than sweets. DD: I see! Do your parents not like sweets very much? DE: Yes, that's right. Somehow, I've developed a very discerning palate and can't bring myself to buy something subpar. Haha. DD: That's a high hurdle! It seems like you'll need to do some research and preparation first! Haha. DE: ""Is that so? Do you buy souvenirs for your family on your way back from work?"" DD: You buy quite a lot! Everyone in our family likes sweets, so we often buy sweet things! DE: What kind of things have you eaten recently? DD: Since I like Japanese sweets, I ate ohagi from the Japanese sweets shop in the department store! DE: I also like wagashi. I feel that ohagi has recently become more stylish and delicious. DD: That's right! It's fun just to look at them! It's tough because they don't last long and I can only buy a small amount. DE: Certainly. When I was learning the tea ceremony before, I used to eat seasonal Japanese sweets almost every week. DD: Wow! Tea ceremony, that sounds great! I've always admired it! Including the traditional sweets! Hehe. DE: There is an elegance that cannot be expressed in the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. It is refined and I love it. DD: ""That's lovely - it's making me want to drink some matcha."" DE: I drank matcha the day before yesterday. There is a Japanese-style cafe in the neighborhood that serves wagashi and matcha. DD: There’s such a stylish café in your neighborhood? That's nice! Do you go there often? DE: Yes, I might go about once a week. You can enter casually without any formalities. DD: Then, you are a regular customer! DE: ""Yes. It is a store run by an acquaintance."" DD: That makes going even more easy and enjoyable! Thank you very much!"
3,"DE: Hello. Nice to meet you. CR: Hello. Please. DE: What are your hobbies? CR: There's nothing in particular, but I like to be active. DE: Is it some kind of sport? Or is it training or something? CR: ""It's a bit of training at the gym."" DE: It's cool. I also went to the gym, but I couldn't continue. CR: I think it won't continue without some kind of goal. DE: I see. I usually just walk my dog. CR: Walking the dog looks fun. I long for it. DE: The heat was so intense in the summer that I hesitated to go for a walk, but walking together is enjoyable. CR: Certainly, there are times when it's hot and times when it's cold. DE: Yes, yes. The gym is not affected by the heat or cold, right? CR: The environment is good all year round. DE: ""Do you also use things like running machines?"" CR: Finally, I will run on the machine for 30 minutes. DE: It's healthy. I used a machine with adjustable incline at the gym I used to go to. CR: ""You can add a slope, right? It gets tough with just a little."" DE: ""When there is an incline, it puts quite a load on you. It felt like mountain climbing."" CR: LOL. Indeed, even walking at an incline is tough. DE: How many hours a day do you train? CR: ""Twice a week for about 2 hours each time."" DE: ""It's a nice, moderate feeling. It's important to be able to continue. That's wonderful."" CR: ""If it becomes too much of a burden, you'll want to quit, won't you?"" DE: I see. And then I retired. Hahaha. CR: It feels like it continued by chance. DE: During the time when I was often at home because of the pandemic, I was doing Zumba indoors. CR: Is it by watching YouTube? DE: Yes. It seems like I can keep going if there's music. CR: That looks fun."
4,"DE: Hello. CR: Hello. DE: Do you have any plans to go out in the fall? CR: I want to go on a trip, but... DE: Sounds good. I wonder how the situation with COVID-19 is. CR: Yes. I want you to calm down. DE: That's true. Do you have any idea where you want to go? CR: I'm thinking about wanting to go to Noto. DE: Was it Noto or Toyama? CR: Yes. Because I have never been there. DE: I remember the fish being delicious. Sweet shrimp and yellowtail, for example. CR: I see. I definitely want to eat fish. DE: Fish from the Sea of Japan are delicious, aren't they? CR: That's right. There are also plenty of varieties. DE: ""On the Hokuriku Shinkansen?"" CR: That's the tricky part. Whether to take the plane or the Shinkansen. DE: I see. I've never ridden the Hokuriku Shinkansen, so I want to try it. Airplanes are convenient because they are fast. CR: I don't have one either. Is it not very fast? DE: It depends on where the airport is. CR: It's subtle. Really. DE: If you're going to drive, renting a car is an option. CR: The rental car pattern from the airport is convenient, isn't it? DE: Yes, you can go to various places. CR: Even in small places, there are interesting spots that I want to visit. DE: That's right. A trip to Hokuriku sounds nice. Are you going to Kanazawa as well? CR: If staying for two nights, I would also like to visit Kanazawa. DE: ""It was a nice place in the castle town. Like Kenrokuen."" CR: Right. But I've been to Kanazawa before, so what should I do? DE: I see. Planning an itinerary is one of the pleasures, isn't it? CR: ""Also, Corona-kun, please behave yourself."""
5,"DE: Hello. Please. CR: Hello. DE: Do you listen to music? CR: I just listen to the songs playing on FM. DE: I see. The radio station J-WAVE is playing here too. CR: I listen to it on Radiko on my smartphone during my commute. DE: Yes, yes. Radiko is great because you can listen to it later even if you miss it. CR: It's clearer than the radio waves. DE: ""In the past, it used to be noisy. Indeed."" CR: Speaking of which, I was watching TikTok recently and thought that EDM is pretty cool. DE: What is EDM? I'm sorry, I don't know. CR: It seems to be electronic dance music. DE: ""Is it a video of you dancing to the music?"" CR: EDM is apparently for clubs and live shows. DE: I see. Do you mean enjoying clubs and live performances through videos? CR: It seems like going to the club and dancing while listening to this song. DE: Because of COVID-19, it's quite difficult to go to clubs and live houses, isn't it? But some people are still going. CR: Yes, indeed. I would like to go there someday and see how it feels to move my body. DE: ""Before COVID, I used to go quite often. It's incredibly fun to move my body to the music."" CR: I have only been to a club once, and it was boring that time. DE: It sounds like it was boring when you went. What kind of genres do you like? CR: ""It's definitely not enka, haha. The last concert I went to was Lady Gaga's."" DE: Oh, speaking of Lady Gaga, it's Top Gun. Have you watched it? CR: I watched it! DE: I watched it too! Twice! CR: Twice!! I ended up crying at the end. DE: Already, from the first intro, goosebumps and tear ducts. CR: ""That was cool, it was a heaping pile."" DE: It was truly a movie full of entertainment. CR: It's a sure thing!"
6,"DE: Hello CR: Hello. DE: Do you like coffee? CR: I drink it with sugar and milk. DE: I see. I'm completely on the black side. CR: ""I like coffee. What kind of coffee?"" DE: I like ones that are relatively strong in acidity and fruity, like Ethiopian. CR: You're an adult. I don't like black coffee. DE: ""I used to dislike it, but after starting to work, I came to like it. I am a little bad with sweet things."" CR: I see, I have always been bad with black from the past until now. DE: I like coffee, but I'm sensitive to caffeine. I prefer a small amount or decaf. CR: I wonder if it's true that coffee wakes you up. DE: Coffee to avoid getting sleepy at work. CR: Thinking that way, I also drink while working, but it just seems to affect my mood. DE: Are there people on whom caffeine works and those on whom it doesn't? CR: Is it my constitution? DE: That might be the case. When I used to practice the tea ceremony, the thick matcha was intense. CR: Oh, I am thinking of learning the tea ceremony. DE: Sure, tea ceremony. It's profound. CR: A one-day trial course is also an option, right? DE: I think it's a good idea. I believe it's better to check the atmosphere of the classroom before joining. CR: What kind of atmosphere do you recommend? DE: In my case, I thought a classroom where I could truly enjoy wabi-sabi would be nice, without topics like illness coming up. CR: ""Does such a topic come up?"" DE: ""The previous classroom was really only about conversations related to tea ceremony, but after moving to Tokyo and changing classrooms, the atmosphere was completely different."" CR: ""Is that why you quit?"" DE: That's right. It's just too different. I didn't want to quit, but... CR: ""I hope there will be another good place."" DE: That's right. I hope you encounter a good classroom. CR: A classroom with delicious snacks would be nice."
7,"DE: Good evening! BG: Good evening! What kind of hobbies do you have? DE: I've dabbled in various things, but recently I've become interested in DIY. BG: DIY is wonderful! Various parts are sold, so it seems fun to choose them. DE: Yes, that's right. It's also fun to think about the process. What are your hobbies? BG: It looks fun! I also do various things - essays, walks, photography, piano, Fujii Kaze. DE: Essay! What is it? Amazing. BG: You might also call it an essay. It's like an extension of a diary. You write about what you're thinking. DE: I felt like I understood when it was said that it was an extension of a diary. It's nice because it helps organize your thoughts. BG: When it comes to diaries, I feel like I have to keep it up, but if I think of it as writing when I want to, it's easier. DE: I also think about doing it every day, but I can't quite manage it. If it's okay to do it occasionally, I would like to try it too. BG: Yes, let's do it! By all means. You can look back at it later, and it's interesting. DE: ""It's nice to read it again. Sometimes when I reread my old blog posts, I feel glad that I wrote them."" BG: Blog! I have also done it before. I still have one now, but it's inactive. Currently, I am particular about handwriting. DE: ""Do you have any particular stationery that you are particular about?"" BG: There are various kinds of writing instruments I like. Especially ballpoint pens. I'm a stationery geek. DE: Stationery nerd! I have a favorite stationery store in my neighborhood, and I ended up buying a fountain pen that I won't even use. BG: Fountain pens are cool, aren't they? I used to use one too, but now I mostly use ballpoint pens. The feel of writing is fussy. DE: What size are you using? Is it thin or thick? BG: 0.5 is the best. The Uni Jetstream is amazing. DE: Oh, I'll take a look at the stationery store next time! You like the thin ones, don't you? BG: I see. I also do the work of writing thank-you letters, and it's easier to write with a thin pen. DE: It seems like you are someone who writes well. BG: ""No, no. It's just ordinary writing. I also like doodling on colored paper with colored brush pens."" DE: But since you do it for work, you must be very good at it. I gave up on You Can's ballpoint pen writing. BG: You were taking a penmanship course, right? That course was too short. It needs to be a bit longer. DE: ""If it's a character I use regularly, I practice it, but if it's one I don't use, my motivation doesn't go up."" BG: I understand that. You have to practice various characters and sentences, so it's tough to keep at it diligently. DE: That's right. It would be best if you could enjoy writing. BG: Ah, you said something nice. That's right. Enjoying is the best."
8,"DE: Hello. Please! BF: Yes, thank you. DE: Did you have a summer vacation? BF: I don't work, so every day feels like summer vacation. How about you? DE: I couldn't go home for the summer because I had to work without any vacation. How did you spend your summer? BF: Oh dear, that must have been tough. I went on a trip with my family during Obon. DE: ""Nice! Where did you go?"" BF: It's Nagano Prefecture! DE: Sounds good. Is it in the mountains? BF: Yes, I went near a mountain called Yatsugatake. It was very cool and comfortable. DE: It looks comfortable!! Is it in Kiyosato? BF: ""Oh, exactly! Are you familiar with Nagano?"" DE: I've been to Kiyosato, but I've also climbed Mount Yatsugatake. BF: Oh! Is that so? Do you like mountain climbing? DE: That's right. I haven't climbed in the last few years, but I used to climb various mountains with my family and fellow climbers. BF: You're active! I might not have gone hiking since elementary school. DE: I also thought, ""No way!"" during my elementary school mountain climbing, but I started climbing because of my family's influence. BF: The influence of family is significant, isn't it? Are there any mountains that left an impression on you? DE: The harshest and coldest place was definitely Yatsugatake. It was extremely windy on top of the cold. BF: Wow! Is that so? Did you climb it in the winter? DE: I wonder when it was. It was a winter mountain, but I think it was spring or autumn. BF: I see. I feel like I won't be able to climb the mountain unless I build up more physical strength. DE: I also want to relax at the foot of the mountain now. BF: Hahaha, I understand. Taking it easy and eating delicious food is the best! DE: Did you eat something delicious in Kiyosato? BF: Yes, I ate a lot! DE: What was the most delicious? BF: Is it corn? I tried various kinds. DE: ""Looks delicious! Definitely looks delicious!"" BF: ""It was very delicious. Well then, let's talk again."""
9,"DE: Hello! BF: Hello, nice to meet you. DE: Have you already decided what to have for dinner tonight? BF: Actually, I haven't decided at all yet. How about you? DE: I haven't decided at all either, and I just thought, ""What's in the refrigerator right now?"" BF: It's quite difficult to come up with a menu every day, isn't it? DE: It's true, it's true! Do you go shopping every day? BF: No, I do bulk shopping on the weekends. DE: Same here. When the contents of the refrigerator get low, stir-fries tend to increase. BF: Ahaha, I understand. There's especially not much left in the fridge on Fridays. DE: That's right. When you search for a recipe with a certain ingredient on the internet, it usually ends up being a stir-fry. BF: I understand completely. I'm thinking maybe I'll just buy it today because it's a hassle. DE: How far is the local supermarket from your house? BF: There are 4-5 shops within a 10-minute walk, so you have plenty of options. DE: It's the best. You can choose as much as you want. BF: That's right. Also, there is a delicious yakitori restaurant in the neighborhood. DE: Eh! I'm so jealous! BF: I'm thinking of buying and eating yakitori there today. DE: ""It's takeout, right? It's nice that such places have increased recently."" BF: That's right. I shouldn't say it's thanks to COVID, but it's been fun. DE: It's really enjoyable to be able to experience the taste without having to go into the store. BF: ""You sometimes feel it's intimidating to enter the store, right?"" DE: Right! It's more convenient than dining in for lunch. BF: Indeed. Ah, I'm starting to feel hungry. DE: ""Same here. I'm hungry. I'm hooked on the original takoyaki sold at the local supermarket."" BF: Eh! That sounds somehow delicious! DE: The broth is really flavorful, and the chewy texture makes it absolutely exquisite! BF: Wow, my stomach just growled! DE: Wahaha. I hope it will be a delicious dinner! BF: Yes! Let's talk again!"
10,"DE: Hello! BF: Hi, hello. DE: Do you often go out? BF: Hmm, not much lately. I feel like going on a spontaneous trip somewhere. DE: ""These days, with the coronavirus, it feels like we can't really let loose."" BF: That's right. I'd really like to go overseas, though. DE: Which country would you like to visit abroad? BF: I wonder if it's Europe. Italy, Germany, Spain, etc.! DE: ""It's nice, isn't it? I've briefly visited Germany. I haven't been to Italy or Spain yet, so I'd like to go."" BF: You've been there, right? I haven't set foot in Europe yet. DE: France was also very nice! BF: Wow, that's nice! Which part of France did you visit? DE: I went about three times. Although I went to Paris a lot, I also enjoyed touring the old castles of Renoir. BF: Great! You like traveling abroad, don't you? DE: When my younger sister was assigned to the Czech Republic, I took advantage of it and traveled extensively. BF: ""That sounds great! I wish my sister would get posted overseas too."" DE: Hahaha. It was just a coincidence. The food in places like Spain and Italy looks delicious, doesn't it! BF: That's right. Also, I like soccer, so I really want to watch a match in the authentic setting. DE: I see! Spain has a strong image of soccer. It seems like even amateurs can have fun in the home country! BF: It sounds fun! I think Germany is nice because the beer looks delicious. DE: The sausages were also delicious! They go well with beer, don't they? BF: Definitely a delicious one! Suddenly, my desire to travel has increased! DE: From around November, Christmas markets are held throughout the town. This was also quite interesting. BF: That's great! I hope we can soon travel without any hesitation. DE: That's right. They have German events like Oktoberfest in Tokyo too, so it seems like we can enjoy the atmosphere at least. BF: Certainly! While enjoying the atmosphere there, I think I'll save up for the actual trip. DE: I'm really starting to want to go on a trip. I want to go to Paris again. BF: I also want to make my European debut soon. DE: ""You're going to watch authentic Spanish and Italian soccer, right?"" BF: Yes, let's talk about our travels again!"
11,"DE: Hello! BM: Hello!! DE: Do you have anything you want to do once the COVID-19 situation settles down? BM: I want to go on an overseas trip. DE: Sounds good. Do you have any ideas about where you'd like to go? BM: I haven't been to many places, so anywhere is fine. Taiwan would be a safe choice. DE: The food looks delicious, doesn't it? BM: ""That's right. There's also a place that served as a model for Spirited Away, isn't there? If I remember correctly."" DE: ""It's the place where Chihiro's parents are eating a lot, right? What was that place called again?"" BM: I don't remember the name at all. But just the thought of being able to go to the movies makes me excited. DE: Certainly. A friend who went there said it was good. BM: Really! I would like to hear more details from that person. DE: Sure. Here's the translated sentence: ""That's right. It seems very detailed. Taiwan seems easy to visit, which is great. I want to go."" BM: I've heard that there are many kind people, and it seems easy to move around. DE: The risk level seems to be low. Do you like traveling? BM: I like traveling. How about you? DE: I also like it. I liked Europe. BM: ""Have you been to many places overseas?"" DE: My first overseas trip was to Guam on a company trip. After that, I traveled to various places. BM: Was the best one Europe? DE: I see. It's not comparable, but Canada was also good. BM: What kind of places did you visit when you went? DE: Since the main goal was to see the aurora, I went to a place called Yellowknife. BM: I've heard of the name! It seems like a very beautiful place, doesn't it? DE: Yes, there were cabins for Japanese tours, so I could go with peace of mind. BM: It's reassuring to have guidance in Japanese. DE: Yes, yes. We ate deer stew while waiting for the aurora. BM: I've heard that deer meat has a strong smell, how was it? DE: The smell didn't bother me much. Food is one of the pleasures of travel, isn't it? BM: I understand. Food is important when traveling, isn't it!"
12,"DE: Hello! DD: Hello! DE: Do you have any goals in the near future? DD: For now, my goal is to get into graduate school. DE: It's wonderful. May I ask what you are studying? DD: I am majoring in Mechanical Systems Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering. DE: Wow, amazing. This is an unknown field of study to me. What kind of jobs can you get into with it? DD: It includes a variety of fields such as automotive, robotics, and energy. DE: The study necessary for the future, isn't it? I took a PCR test today, and I heard that a robot was doing the testing. DD: I see?! Automation is a good thing! DE: What kind of things do you think will become automated? DD: I thought that the caregiving field would be automated. Complete automation of automobiles still seemed far off. DE: ""Certainly, if caregiving tasks are automated, it will become easier! Some people also enjoy driving cars. I'm one of them."" DD: That's right, considering the balance with the infrastructure, it seems difficult. DE: Do you know about Toyota's automated city? DD: ""I've heard of it! Where is it located?"" DE: It seems that it will be made in Susono City, at the foot of Mt. Fuji. DD: Amazing! Are buses and trucks going to be automated? I'm curious! DE: That's right. I'm also curious about what kind of people live there and how. DD: ""Yes, I would like to live there."" DE: It seems like you can find the details by searching on Toyota Times. DD: ""It's the one from the commercial! And there's one more goal..."" DE: What is it? Having many goals is wonderful. DD: It might be more of a duty than a goal, but I want to lose weight. DE: Hahaha. I want to lose weight! Are you concerned about things like weight and body shape? DD: It makes me curious... Lately, there are a lot of cute girls... DE: ""There are many cute girls. Or rather, everyone is tall and has long legs."" DD: That's right!! So I think I should lose weight too! DE: It's best to take care of your body and not overdo it; health comes first. DD: I will do my best while being careful."
