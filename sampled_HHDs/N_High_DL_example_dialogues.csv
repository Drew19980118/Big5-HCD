1,"DL: Good evening. Nice to meet you. DY: Good evening, nice to meet you. DL: Suddenly, but do you read manga or anything like that? DY: I often read manga! DL: Do you have any favorite works? DY: Recently, I found a jazz manga called ""Blue Giant"" interesting. DL: ""I have heard of it! Is it a currently ongoing series?"" DY: Yes, it is being serialized. Since I only read the compiled volumes, I don't know which magazine it is serialized in. DL: ""It seems like a Big Comic. It appears to have been made into a movie as well. I'm getting a little curious about it."" DY: It's really interesting. Even though it's a manga, it has the intensity that makes it feel like you can hear the sounds. DL: I'll look it up and read it later! It's nice that we can easily read the first episode if we're interested. DY: Certainly, it's helpful that we can read things now. Is there anything interesting on your side? DL: I like works like ""March Comes in Like a Lion,"" ""Raika Days,"" and ""Hatarakanai Futari,"" although they might be considered minor. DY: ""I used to read 'Hatarakanai Futari' a long time ago! It's the one about the NEET siblings, right!"" DL: That's right, that's right! I feel happy about it! Since it is updated every week, I look forward to reading it every week. DY: It's nice and peaceful, isn't it? I also read a bit of March Comes in Like a Lion. It's the one about shogi, right? DL: It seems to be quite well-read. I'm really happy because it feels like I've made some friends! Do you have any other manga recommendations? DY: We might have similar tastes in manga. Also, do you know Blue Period? It's one of my favorites. DL: ""Is it the one in the afternoon?"" DY: That's right! It's the art manga one. DL: You like intense plots in manga, don't you! DY: Sure! Here's the translation: ""That's right! I might like intense developments. However, I don't read manga as much as I used to."" DL: Oh, have you become busy with work or found a new hobby? DY: I think I spend a lot of time lazily watching YouTube. DL: ""That is a time thief, isn't it? What kind of videos do you watch?"" DY: That's right, it's a time thief. I often end up watching game playthroughs idly. DL: Ah! I get it now. Interesting people are really interesting, aren't they? And each video is so long. Before you know it, it's already this late! Something like that. DY: That's true, and before you know it, it's time to sleep. Do you watch YouTube? DL: I wouldn't say I watch it closely; it's more like I listen to it while doing housework, like a radio. It helps me clear my mind quite a bit. DY: Indeed, there are times when I just listen without watching!"
2,"DL: Good evening. Please take care of me. DY: Good evening, thank you in advance. DL: Recently, is there anything you're having trouble with? DY: ""Is something troubling you? I guess it's just that my job is too boring."" DL: ""Is it boring? Are you doing clerical work instead of a professional job?"" DY: Since I am a system engineer, it is a specialized job, but I have stopped feeling very fulfilled by it. DL: Is that so? I had an impression that creating various systems would be quite glamorous. Is that not the case? DY: It's tough having too many working hours. It's like working until midnight every day was normal. But now I'm in a different department, so it's okay. DL: ""Until late at night!? Is it such a hard job!?"" DY: It's like catching the last train every day. Working late into the night is just normal! Though I think it's improved compared to the past. DL: By the way, did you properly receive overtime pay!? It seems like it would be a lot if it was every day. DY: Since it was a company that paid overtime, that was good. But I ended up thinking I didn't need to work that much. DL: ""Yes! Health is important! So, are you leaving work on time more often now?"" DY: Yes, that's right, I work 1 to 2 hours of overtime a day. But since I started teleworking, it's been really easy because I'm at home. DL: It was good! But earlier, you said it was boring. Does that mean the job is too easy or something like that? DY: I think it's because I don't feel a sense of fulfillment. I used to build systems, but now I'm managing people. DL: Managing people doesn't seem interesting to you. You prefer creating systems, don't you? DY: That might be the case. However, for those who create systems, it involves long working hours, being busy, and tension. It's a difficult problem. DL: Both sides have their own issues, don't they? It's a tough decision on which to prioritize. Have you ever thought about changing jobs? DY: Since I have a family, I realized I couldn't go on adventures. I'm not dissatisfied with the financial aspect, so I thought it would be best to leave it as it is! DL: I see. You have found an answer. That's good. Indeed, having a family can sometimes restrict your freedom, right? DY: Yes! Having a family has given me a place to calm my mind, so I think that has been good too. DL: Somehow I felt relieved. By the way, how did you meet your wife? DY: I met my wife through a matching app, it's quite rare, isn't it! DL: Yes! That's a bit surprising. Do your hobbies and interests match? I'm curious. DY: My hobby was not that much, but our values really matched well! DL: That's really important, isn't it! I often hear that it can be quite painful when values are different. DY: I think so. It's really fun to be together because I don't have to pretend or put on any airs when I'm with you! DL: A very happy atmosphere is being conveyed. Wishing you happiness forever! DY: Thank you very much!"
3,"DL: Good evening, please take care of me! DK: Thank you in advance. DL: Do you have any favorite foods, minkabu? DK: There's nothing particularly special, but I like katsudon and had it today. DL: I love katsudon too! I just ate it this morning! DK: ""Can I eat it from the morning?"" DL: Rather, I eat a lot in the morning. Conversely, I eat lightly at night. DK: There are people like that, aren't there? Has it been that way for a long time? DL: Yes. It's a remnant from the time when I was on a diet. DK: Eating before bed makes you gain weight. DL: But don't you find late-night snacks somewhat indulgent and tempting? DK: Yes, that happens. I would make instant yakisoba for a late-night snack and drink alcohol. DL: ""Isn't this the best combination! Just when I said I would take it easy at night, I've started wanting to eat."" DK: Recently, I've been refraining from drinking at night. DL: ""Is it about creating alcohol-free days?"" DK: I don't drink every day originally, and recently non-alcoholic drinks have increased. I only drink during dinner. DL: Recently, I haven't had any non-alcoholic drinks, but how do they taste? DK: Domestic non-alcoholic beers have a too strong aroma, but low-alcohol Beery is delicious. DL: After all, the real thing is the best! Do you feel the same way? DK: That's right, I often drink non-alcoholic beer made in Germany, sold at Gyomu Super. DL: I also often go to the Gyomu Supermarket. They have various kinds of alcohol, don't they? DK: Yes, I mainly buy alcohol and sweets. DL: Do you have any recommendations? DK: Among the items sold exclusively at Gyomu Super, the spicy Mala Ikari Beans were good. DL: Thank you. I'll look for it next time I go. I often buy squid fries. DK: Fried squid is also nice. DL: That saltiness goes well with beer. DK: Sounds good, I'm starting to want a drink. DL: I started wanting to drink too, even though it's this late. I'm also getting curious about those beans. DK: Given the time, let's be patient!"
4,"DL: Please take care of it. DE: Yes, please! DL: ""The conversation has turned to food, but do you have any favorite foods?"" DE: Lately, I've been really into the takoyaki from the deli section at the supermarket. DL: ""Takoyaki, you say! Is it because the octopus pieces are quite large, or is there some other reason you're hooked?"" DE: I thought it was dashi. Also, the dough is chewy and very delicious. DL: A chewy dough with flavorful broth! It sounds delicious just from the text! I want to try it! DE: There are many takoyaki shops, each with its own delicious flavor, but this takoyaki has a taste that you won't find anywhere else. DL: ""Does it change that much!? Comparing them sounds interesting!"" DE: Right. I really think I like takoyaki. What kind of food do you like? DL: I generally like fried foods quite a bit, but lately I've especially been into tonkatsu. DE: I see! It's not common to have just tonkatsu, but I often eat katsu sandwiches. DL: I also like katsu sandwiches! That crispy texture is irresistible, isn't it! DE: Do you know a sandwich shop called MÃ¤rchen? DL: No, it's the first time I've heard of it. What kind of wonderful sandwiches do they have!? DE: There are also cutlet sandwiches, but the fruit-based cream sandwiches are really plentiful. DL: Cream sandwich! It has a wonderful ring to it. Strawberries or peaches come to mind. Do you have any recommendations? DE: The ones I ate before were strawberries and mandarins. Also, pineapples and Shine Muscat grapes were delicious. DL: ""Shine Muscat!? Is that really an ingredient!? I can already imagine the amazing taste! I want to try it!"" DE: I'm sure they also have seasonal limited products, so you can enjoy various flavors every time you go. DL: ""What a lovely shop. Do you come here often?"" DE: I have the impression that there are stores in large JR stations. I always buy them at Shinagawa when I return home. DL: I thought it was a single shop, but there are several locations! If I get the chance, I'd definitely like to make a purchase there. DE: I also started wanting to eat! DL: ""That's nice, isn't it? It's like the perfect thing to reward yourself with, isn't it?"" DE: Rewarding yourself is important, isn't it? DL: ""That's right! Especially in times like these, I think it's very important!"" DE: I want to eat lots of delicious food and spend my time with a smile. DL: I understand. Precisely because times are tough now! Right? DE: Yes, yes. Food is important!"
5,"DL: Good evening! Nice to meet you. DU: Good evening. Thank you in advance. DL: Have you had anything pleasant happen recently? DU: Is it something exciting? Hmm. If it's something to look forward to, I have plans for a weekend camp festival. DL: ""Is it a camping festival!? When you say festival, does it mean various people camp at the same place?"" DU: That's right. And on top of that, it's like a music festival. DL: ""Music too? Are various artists participating?"" DU: It seems that various famous people, including reggae artists, will be coming. It's my first festival ever. DL: ""During the day you can camp, and at night you can enjoy music, right? It sounds really fun!"" DU: If I had to say, it feels like we can enjoy music and shopping all day and then sleep in a tent at night! DL: I've never been camping before, so I kind of admire it. Do you often go camping? DU: I started at the end of last year, so my camping experience is still short. DL: ""At the end of the year? Was there some kind of trigger or something?"" DU: ""My husband has always wanted to do it, but I wasn't enthusiastic about it. But when I saw my friends doing it, I became interested."" DL: How was it when you actually tried it? Did you feel like you enjoyed it more than you expected? DU: That's right. And I fell into the camping obsession. I can't stop wanting more gear. DL: ""Material desire, huh! What kind of things do you want now?"" DU: Actually, it's a tent, but since I already have three kinds and there's a storage problem, it's a bit of a dilemma. DL: ""Three types!? Even though there are so many, you still want them. Do they have some amazing features? Or is it because of the brand?"" DU: No. It might be the difference in appearance or size. DL: I see. Do you mean you want to use them according to their purpose? DU: Yes. Initially, I thought it would be like a disaster drill if I could sleep in a tent. But now, I feel like I want to differentiate between them. DL: ""It seems you are steadily getting stuck in the swamp."" DU: It's troubling. DL: By the way, do tents cost quite a bit? DU: ""It's quite varied. I started with a cheap pop-up tent under 20,000 yen."" DL: ""To say that 20,000 yen is cheap... I apologize for my ignorance, but does that mean there are more expensive things than that!?"" DU: I see. If it's expensive, it exceeds 100,000 yen. It's unaffordable. DL: Wow! Once you get particular about it, it really seems like you won't be able to stop! DU: One-touch is spacious and can accommodate 4-5 people sleeping, so I recommend it. See you later."
6,"DL: Good evening. Nice to meet you. DY: Good evening, please take care of me! DL: ""Have you been into anything lately?"" DY: Lately, I've been hooked on games. DL: ""Is it a game!? Is it a home console game? Or is it a smartphone game?"" DY: I don't play smartphone games; I only use the Switch. DL: I also play games a little on the Switch! What kind of games do you play? DY: I'm always playing Splatoon! DL: ""I often hear it's interesting! Do you play it a lot?"" DY: ""I'm doing quite well! A new release is coming next week, so I'm really looking forward to it!"" DL: Ah! If I remember correctly, 3 is about to be released soon, right? Have you already pre-ordered it? DY: Yes, number 3 will be released! I have also made a reservation! DL: It seems like you're really fired up. I've heard from a friend who plays that the people you face in online matches are like residents of a land of fierce warriors, but is online battling really tough for beginners? DY: I think it's fine since you will be matched with an opponent of your own rank. DL: Oh, I see. So they match you according to your ability. I was a bit interested, but I just couldn't gather the courage. DY: At first, it's not so much that the enemies are strong, but rather that it might be difficult to control things the way you want. However, you'll get used to it! DL: ""Is it going to happen!? All thatâs left is just taking the plunge! Thatâs how it feels."" DY: That's right, I recommend starting with number 3! DL: ""Is there a trial version or something like that? I might want to experience what the atmosphere is like."" DY: The trial version was available only last Sunday, so I think it is no longer available. DL: Wow, were you able to do that before!? I might have missed something special. DY: That's right, it was available for free for 12 hours only. What a shame. DL: By the way, when you say that, does it mean you were being toyed with? DY: Yes, I didn't play for 12 hours straight, but I did play for about 2 hours! DL: Oh! How was it!? Did it seem quite promising!? DY: It was extremely fun! I'm really looking forward to the release date! DL: The atmosphere seems fun just from the text! That's great! DY: Yes, it might be the game I've been most obsessed with in my life, so I'm quite passionate about it! DL: After the demo version comes out after the release, I'll have to play this! I'm starting to look forward to the release date a little. DY: Yes, please try it out when the trial version is released!"
7,"DL: Good evening. Please take care of me. CB: Good evening. Nice to meet you. DL: Have you been into anything lately? CB: I see... I guess it's dramas. And also YouTube, maybe. DL: I also watch YouTube. What kind of genres do you watch? CB: ""Recently, I often watch videos of Yusuke Narita and Hiroyuki."" DL: ""Both are new to me. What kind of content are they?"" CB: Hmm. It feels like various things from the economist and top graduate of Tokyo University. DL: Saying ""various things"" means topics other than the economy and really various other things, right? CB: ""That's really a lot, isn't it? As a commentator, it's an interesting feeling."" DL: You're very good at speaking! I'm envious of people who have such skills! I'm not very good at talking face-to-face. How about you? CB: I'm comfortable with one-on-one, but I'm not good with large groups. DL: Me too. I get nervous no matter what. Like, um, um, I get all flustered. CB: What is your communication style at work? DL: In each department's workplace, I work with the same people all the time, so the communication is quite friendly. Still, it was quite challenging at first. CB: I see. I think stressful human relationships are the biggest issue. DL: How is your workplace over there? CB: ""I'm currently juggling three jobs, and since each one is different, it feels like a good change of pace."" DL: ""Are you working three jobs?! Don't you get confused with all the different work?!"" CB: For now, it's okay. DL: What kind of work do you do? CB: ""Caregiver, home office, and call center."" DL: Oh! That's quite a wide range. Were you interested in all those job types? CB: I was working full-time from home, but since my work has decreased a little, I'm doing some part-time work. DL: As expected, is it related to COVID-19? CB: The coronavirus isn't particularly relevant. The decrease in work is. DL: Is that so? There was a little impact on our workplace. CB: So your job was affected by COVID-19. What kind of work is it related to? DL: We are in the manufacturing industry, but it felt like materials weren't coming in. CB: Ah, I see. The import business is affected by COVID, isn't it?"
8,"DL: Good evening. Please take care of me. CB: Good evening. Nice to meet you! DL: Have you already had dinner today? CB: Yes, I ate it. It was curry udon. DL: Curry udon! Sounds good. By the way, what's your favorite food? CB: ""It's curry."" DL: ""Is it curry! Are you quite particular about making it?"" CB: ""I make a variety of curries, from spicy curry to regular curry."" DL: ""Do you start with spices! Is the taste different from commercially available ones?"" CB: It's fun because you can make various things to your liking! DL: Did you have any specific reason or inspiration to try making it from spices? CB: I've always liked Indian curry. DL: Oh! Did you go to eat at a restaurant? Or did you go to the place itself? CB: I have been to Bangladesh. Also to places like Thailand. DL: Do you also go overseas? Are the flavors of the food quite different from those in Japan? CB: ""I wasn't particularly looking forward to the curry, but it's completely different depending on the country, isn't it?"" DL: Have you ever been to a country where the food didn't suit your taste? CB: I don't have much overseas experience, but have you been anywhere? DL: Actually, I don't have any. So, I really can't imagine what it's like overseas. I don't have the courage to travel. CB: I see. I happened to have an acquaintance there, so I went alone and met up with them locally. DL: ""Alone!? Even if you met up with someone locally, you're a hero in my eyes. Weren't you scared!?"" CB: Since I was young, I might have been energetic. Now, I can't go. DL: Momentum is important, isn't it? What were your impressions of your first trip abroad? CB: The airplane was delayed and there were various difficulties, but I had a lot of encounters and it was fun. DL: ""Did you meet someone? That's nice. Did you learn the local language before your trip?"" CB: ""It was with a conversation book in one hand."" DL: Is that how you manage to communicate somehow? CB: There was an interpreter. DL: I see there was an interpreter. Having one makes me feel at ease. CB: That's right. Since we were friends, we were able to communicate quite naturally."
9,"DL: Good evening. Please take care of me. CB: Good evening. Please take care of me. DL: Do you often read books or manga? CB: ""I wouldn't say I'm addicted to reading, but I do read. For manga, I mostly read Line Manga."" DL: Have you read anything interesting recently? CB: ""Now, I was re-reading Glass Mask."" DL: That is a masterpiece, isn't it? I'm on the edge of my seat to see how it ends. CB: ""Will it be completed while I'm alive? It's unclear."" DL: ""Right? When it becomes a long-term series, that side of things can become frightening too."" CB: ""It feels like the author has no intention of writing the continuation."" DL: Since they are quite elderly, we can only wait patiently. Do you have any other recommended manga? CB: Dr. Stone was interesting. DL: ""That's the Doihy! one. It's funny, isn't it?"" CB: ""It's interesting, isn't it? Do you have any recommendations?"" DL: ""It's a shogi manga, maybe like March Comes in Like a Lion. The art style is really cute too."" CB: I know the title. The illustrations are definitely cute, aren't they? I haven't read it, so I'd like to try reading it. DL: If you don't mind, please read it. Even if you don't understand shogi, you can still enjoy it. Do you also read printed books? What genres do you read? CB: Printed materials are mostly business books and things related to fortune-telling. DL: When you mention fortune-telling, what kind of things are you referring to? Birth months or palm reading, for example? CB: I have read palm lines and am well-versed in astrology and other related fields. DL: That's amazing. I would love to have my fortune told! When you do fortune-telling, do you often find that your predictions are quite accurate? CB: I see. It feels like you're utilizing it. DL: I see! I'm getting a little interested. CB: There are many people who like it, but there are also people who don't accept fortune telling, so I'm happy. DL: Because it sounds interesting! I think it's wonderful that you might discover a side of yourself that you didn't know about! CB: Yes, that's right. There are various kinds of fortune-telling, and I like to look at them from different perspectives. DL: ""Instead of being uniform, it seems like you can view things from multiple perspectives. I also like looking at astrology websites."" CB: Even with just a little study, you can acquire the skills of a fortune-telling site level, so it's fun. DL: I heard something good. Maybe I'll try studying a bit. CB: It's fun. Definitely, definitely."
10,"DL: Good evening. Please take care of me. DK: Thank you in advance! DL: Have you read any manga recently? DK: Recently, I read ""The Fable""! DL: ""That's the one that was made into a movie! Was it interesting?"" DK: It was more interesting than I thought. I'm also reading the sequel a little bit. DL: I was a little put off by the design, but should I try reading it anyway? DK: Hmm. What kind of manga do you usually like? DL: Basically, I want to read anything. I also read JoJo. DK: ""Jojo is interesting, isn't it? Fable also has its quirks. So, if you had to choose, what is your favorite?"" DL: ""It changes depending on the time. Right now, I like the manga called The Last Restaurant."" DK: I'm sorry. I didn't understand. I haven't read anything like Fable either, but it was recommended to me. DL: ""Does it feel like you got hooked after trying to read it? It seems like avoiding it because of the art style would be a waste, right?"" DK: That's right. So in that sense, it might be true. Kaiji is also very interesting. DL: I like Kaiji too! Indeed, I was put off by it at first. DK: ""Right? The other series are interesting too! Ten, Akagi, and Gin to Kin as well!"" DL: I haven't read any of the other series yet. Among the ones mentioned earlier, which one do you recommend the most? DK: Hmm. The highly rated ones are ""Ten"" and ""Silver and Gold."" The others are not completed yet. I recommend ""Silver and Gold""! DL: Got it! I'll definitely read it! I've read stuff like Hanchou and Tonegawa though. Those are spin-offs. DK: I love both of them the most! DL: That is also interesting! DK: It's interesting, isn't it? It's good to read it after reading the main story. DL: That's right! Conversely, when someone thought Kaiji was the spin-off, I couldn't help but laugh. DK: That's totally hilarious! DL: That response is the best! If you read that before the main story, you'll definitely get confused. DK: Yes. Order is important! DL: For now, I'll read ""Silver and Gold"". I'm really looking forward to it! DK: Oh, by the way, my favorite manga to recommend is called ""Nemurubaka""! DL: ""That's the one by the author of Sore Machi, right? I read it!"" DK: ""It's my favorite manga in the town!"""
11,"DL: Good evening. Nice to meet you. DK: Good evening. DL: Have you already had dinner? DK: No, not yet. DL: ""From now? What kind of food are you planning to eat today?"" DK: I heard itâs Goya Champuru. DL: Do you feel that the person you live with will be making it? DK: My mother will make it. DL: I see. Are you cooking now? DK: It seems so, but I don't know. DL: Do you like goya champuru? DK: Yes, I love it, do you like it? DL: I like it. Although the preliminary preparations are a bit of a hassle. DK: The school lunch wasn't really like goya champuru when I think about it now. DL: ""Did it also appear in school lunches? It never did during my time. Did it taste that different?"" DK: Well, how should I put it, it didn't have any bitterness and was kind of watery and sweet? That was the feeling, I think. DL: That seems to have a very different taste. It seems like a completely different thing. DK: ""What my mother makes feels like something that goes well with rice."" DL: ""Isn't it? It seems like it would go well with rice, right? I can't imagine it being sweet."" DK: School lunch is definitely curry and mapo tofu. DL: ""Mapo tofu was also served?! I've heard of curry being served, but this is the first I've heard of that. Is it a generational difference?"" DK: What kind of menu was popular in your time? DL: ""It's a common choice, but maybe something that goes well with rice like curry or hashed beef."" DK: How about fried bread? DL: Yes, there was. It was only sugar, though. Now, do they also have soybean flour? DK: Maybe there is. By the way, how old are you? DL: Hahaha. I'm about to reach 40 soon. DK: Did you have any competitions during school lunch? DL: ""Boys used to do that a lot, didn't they? Does that not change across generations?"" DK: ""Yes, it's a culture where we adjust the time and try to make someone quit."""
12,"DL: Good evening. Please take care of me. DE: Good evening. Thank you in advance. DL: Do you read manga or anything like that? DE: I sometimes read manga. DL: What kind of things have you read recently? DE: Hmm, I haven't bought any new ones, but something like Tokyo Ghoul. DL: I read it too! Did you read it till the end? DE: I have a general understanding of the contents. DL: I quite like this work. I think the battle descriptions are good. DE: The rather simple-looking kagune also come in various types, which is nice. DL: That's right! I'd like to watch the anime too, but I haven't been able to yet. Hopefully, there will be a sequel as well. DE: Hmm, I feel like just the original anime is enough. I haven't seen Re, but I don't have a good impression of it. DL: Is that so? Is it that the Re version seems to be of lower quality than the original, or is it a content issue? DE: ""I saw it for a moment, but the story development is incredibly fast."" DL: Ah, do you mean you wanted a more detailed description? DE: The combat depiction wasn't well received from the very beginning. DL: I see. Although Muji and Re seem similar, there appears to be quite a difference between them. DE: I guess it's like asking for ramen and being served instant noodles. DL: That's quite a way of putting it to convey the image. Indeed, that would certainly be disappointing. DE: ""Well, I haven't really looked at it properly, so just for reference."" DL: That's helpful. Do you have any recommended anime? DE: The recommended ones are Re:Zero and Overlord, I suppose. DL: ""I'm reading Re:Zero as a manga. The protagonist is really passionate, right!"" DE: ""Did you go as far as the sanctuary?"" DL: I see. Since I prefer paperback books, that's about where I am. DE: The latest is now the Empire. DL: ""Have they progressed significantly from the sanctuary? It seems difficult to catch up on the novels from now on."" DE: If you read it on the internet at an incredible speed, you'll be fine. DL: I see. I'll check it out. DE: I think it's good."
