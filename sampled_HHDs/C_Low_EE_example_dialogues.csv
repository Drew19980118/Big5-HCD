1,"EE: Hello, nice to meet you. BL: Hello. Nice to meet you. EE: What do you do on your days off? BL: Looking at your smartphone, going shopping, and studying. EE: I am similar. What do you often do on your smartphone? BL: There is a lot of research to do. EE: I see. Don't you play games or anything? BL: I hardly play games. EE: I see. I often read manga on my smartphone. BL: Do you have any manga apps installed? EE: Putting it in. BL: ""Manga also often comes through advertisements, doesn't it?"" EE: Jumping from interesting ads, I end up adding more and more apps. BL: Is your smartphone's storage capacity okay? EE: Since I am using an Android, I can increase the storage capacity with an SD card. BL: ""Can apps also be stored on the SD card?"" EE: Mainly, I store photo data. BL: I am also including the photos. EE: Are you using an Android? BL: I have both an android and an iPhone. EE: It is the same!! BL: How do you differentiate between them? EE: Mainly use Android and only take out the iPhone when I need to use it. BL: I see. EE: How do you differentiate between using <BL>? BL: ""It's for calling and communication."" EE: I see! I also often use my iPhone for calls. BL: I'm the opposite. I use an Android for calls. EE: I see. BL: ""It's convenient to use them differently, isn't it?"""
2,"EE: Hello BL: Hello. EE: What is your favorite household chore? BL: ""If I had to say, maybe hanging out the laundry?"" EE: I understand! I don't know why, but it's fun, isn't it? BL: It feels refreshing to hang out things that have become clean. EE: I see, that is certainly true. The laundry hung out after smoothing out the wrinkles looks very good. BL: On the other hand, if you leave it in the washing machine for a long time, it feels unfortunate. EE: If you forget about it, it will start to smell like it's only half dry. BL: The smell is one thing, but it also easily wrinkles. EE: Certainly. I make sure to iron clothes just before hanging them up to dry. BL: ""It's fully automatic, right? Are you intentionally stopping it?"" EE: ""I set the dehydration to 0 minutes and run it on the course up to rinsing."" BL: I see. Our washing machine doesn't have that function. That's nice. EE: Items that easily wrinkle are convenient because the dehydration time can be shortened. BL: When that happens, I press the stop button. I want that feature! EE: The timing seems difficult. BL: That's right, it's difficult to get the timing right when you're doing other things. EE: In the future, if possible, I want a fully automatic washer-dryer. BL: ""Then household chores will become quite a bit easier, right!"" EE: If it automatically dries as well, there wouldn't be the enjoyment of hanging clothes, but I think it would be very convenient. BL: Then, I think I'll start wanting other convenient household items as well. EE: I also want a Roomba. BL: Me too. I'd also like to have a dishwasher. EE: It's the modern version of the three sacred treasures. BL: That's right! I think it will save a lot of time. EE: The world has become a convenient place, hasn't it? BL: The only thing left is for the Roomba to move the luggage out of the way as it goes, and it would be perfect. EE: Certainly. I'm looking forward to the update. BL: Looking forward to the update!"
3,"EE: Good evening! EV: Good evening, nice to meet you. EE: Do you have any favorite foods? EV: You like chicken, don't you? I'm not really a picky eater. EE: Chicken! You can arrange it in many different ways, right? EV: That's right. It's healthy, and you can eat a lot of it. EE: Do you have any favorite dishes in particular? EV: ""Is it karaage or chicken nanban, I wonder? Using thigh meat."" EE: Thigh meat is juicy and delicious, isn't it? EV: Yes, chicken breast cutlets are good too, but I prefer thigh because it’s juicier. EE: Chicken breast cutlet is good too! I want to make it into a sandwich. EV: The local butcher fries chicken tenders for me, so I often buy them. EE: The butcher shop's prepared foods are very delicious, so I end up buying them. EV: Yes, since they fry it after you buy it, it's hot and delicious. EE: I'm hungry. EV: Haven't you had dinner yet? EE: I haven't returned home yet, so it is likely to be around the date change. EV: I see. I've heard that having a late dinner is not very good for you. EE: That's right. So there are often days when I don't eat dinner. EV: I see. I often skip breakfast and lunch, but I try to have dinner. EE: I often skip breakfast, so there are many days when I only have one meal a day. EV: I also occasionally have only dinner on weekdays. EE: ""When you're busy, it ends up like that, doesn't it?"" EV: Yes, it's quite difficult to find a substantial amount of time. EE: If I start living alone, it seems like I'll end up neglecting my meals even more. EV: Before you know it, you might miss your mealtime and have days where you don't eat. EE: Even if I can't cook for myself, I want to at least make an effort to eat properly. EV: Yes, even if it's just some side dishes, you need to eat something or you'll ruin your health. EE: By the way, what was today's dinner? EV: It's mapo eggplant."
4,"EE: Good evening. EV: Good evening, nice to meet you. EE: ""Speaking of autumn, it's the season for sports. Have you been doing anything?"" EV: Recently, I played badminton with my cousin. EE: I was in the badminton club in high school and college! EV: ""I see. I was a member in high school."" EE: Badminton is fun, isn't it? EV: Yes, it's also significant that it can be done indoors and is not affected by the weather. EE: It’s nice to be able to do it anytime, but being affected by the wind is a challenge. EV: Yes, I always did it with the doors closed. EE: In summer, it becomes like a sauna, doesn't it? EV: That's right. It was quite humid. EE: I had heatstroke once before. EV: ""I see. There were indeed people who had cramps due to the heat."" EE: Staying hydrated and taking appropriate breaks are important. EV: Yes, it's important not to overdo it. EE: By the way, was it doubles? EV: Yes. There were a lot of doubles. EE: ""Didn't you play singles much?"" EV: ""I used to play in-house matches, but there were many doubles in tournaments."" EE: Same feeling. EV: The defensive range is simply narrow, so it's easy to handle. EE: ""But there are more things to think about, like rotations with allies."" EV: Certainly, the coordination was initially challenging. EE: It's difficult until you find a stable partner to team up with. EV: Yes, it was difficult when working with various pairs. EE: Did you prefer doubles over singles? EV: ""Well, yes. I liked the feeling of helping each other."" EE: The best part is when we can cover our teammates well. EV: Yes, I think so."
5,"EE: Hello, nice to meet you! BR: Hello. Likewise, thank you in advance! EE: Have you had anything that made you happy recently? BR: Something that made me happy recently was drawing a small manga and making someone pleased. EE: That's great, do you like drawing? BR: Yes. I have liked it for a long time, but I haven't been able to draw it very much. EE: I respect you because I'm not good at drawing! What kind of pictures do you like to draw? BR: I see. It's pretty relaxed. It's not serious at all. EE: I have a friend who is good at drawing, and I was very happy when they drew mascots and other characters in the notebook I lent them. BR: Oh! So you were close by. EE: I had them draw icons for social media and such. BR: That's nice! I want to see it. EE: I had a portrait drawn, and it was very cute. BR: A portrait seems easy but is actually difficult, isn't it? EE: Yes, that's right. What kind of story did you write in the manga? BR: I am currently studying healing, and it was about that. EE: What is healing? BR: ""It's called energy healing, and it's something like qigong."" EE: I see, did you write something like a method explanation? BR: In order to recruit monitors, I tried it and drew how it felt. EE: It's a testimonial, isn't it! I heard about energy healing for the first time, so I want to read it too! BR: I see! Since it's not very well-known, they said it would be good to spread the word. EE: As a reader, I would really appreciate it if it could be turned into a manga. BR: That's right. Especially since it's about the invisible world, visualizing it makes it easier to understand. EE: By the way, what did you like about energy healing? BR: I felt my mental blocks ease and a sense of returning to my own body. EE: It's an experience that's quite hard to imagine with words. BR: That's right. It does look a bit suspicious, so I haven't been able to put it out easily. EE: Even so, there's nothing as useful as the firsthand accounts of those who have actually experienced it. BR: I’m happy to hear you say that! Thank you very much."
6,"EE: Hello, nice to meet you! BR: Hello. Nice to meet you! EE: Do you have any favorite foods? BR: Recently, I've been into South Indian cuisine. EE: I've heard of South Indian cuisine for the first time. What kind of dishes are they? BR: In Japan, North Indian cuisine is predominant, but it is often lighter and sometimes features main dishes that are not naan. EE: What kinds of main dishes are there other than naan? BR: Things like a pie-like dish called parota and a crispy crepe called dosa. EE: ""Do you eat it with curry after all?"" BR: Yes. It's delicious on its own, but it's perfect with curry! Especially dosa is great. EE: It looks delicious! Is it something you can make yourself? BR: Dosa seems to be quite difficult to make because you have to ferment a batter of rice flour and bean flour. EE: I see, then do you eat at the restaurant? BR: Yes. I will look for a South Indian restaurant. I am currently searching for the best one in Japan. EE: I have never been to a restaurant that serves anything other than naan. BR: In Japan, it's still rare, but it's been increasing recently, so definitely! EE: I will try to look for it! BR: Yes, some South Indian restaurants do not have dosa, so in that case, I recommend meals. EE: What kind of food is meals? BR: Meals are like thali set meals, and you can eat various side dishes. EE: What is a thali? BR: The image is that Thali is a set meal from North India, and Meals is a set meal from South India. EE: I see, both were unfamiliar nouns. BR: That's right. If you are not familiar with India, you wouldn't understand, right? My apologies! EE: There is an Indian student in my research lab, so I will ask them! BR: Oh! I see! The food differs depending on where you're from, so definitely! EE: I believe that the two people come from different backgrounds, so I will ask both of them! BR: That sounds fun!! By the way, I used to live near Cochin in South India. EE: So you lived there! No wonder you know so much. I'll try making South Indian cuisine too. BR: Yes! Look forward to it!!"
7,"EE: Hello, nice to meet you! BR: Hello. Nice to meet you! EE: Do you have a favorite sport? BR: I haven't done it much recently, but I used to like snowboarding. EE: I've never snowboarded before. How is it different from skiing? BR: You can move each foot separately when skiing, but with snowboarding, they are fixed. Also, it depends on whether you slide forward or sideways. EE: I see, it seems difficult to balance if it cannot be moved. BR: At first, just standing was difficult. But once I got used to it, I got more hooked than with skiing. EE: There wasn't a ski resort nearby, so I ended up not going skiing after all. BR: That's right. I feel the same way. My body can't keep up as I get older. EE: You need physical strength, right? Do you still like winter? BR: ""Yes! I definitely prefer winter over summer! My favorite is autumn, so I'm looking forward to it!"" EE: I also like autumn. It's comfortable and, above all, there are many delicious things. BR: That's right!! What is your favorite autumn flavor? EE: It's chestnuts! Whether it's in sticky rice or cake, it's delicious! BR: Wow! That's great! It's amazing that it goes well with both rice and sweets! EE: Sweet potatoes are a versatile ingredient that can be used in both rice dishes and sweets. BR: ""Indeed! The flavors of autumn are amazing!"" EE: Do you have any favorite autumn foods? BR: I love pears. I like the juicy, sweet ones. And the texture, too. EE: Pears are delicious, aren't they! I just learned that they are in season in autumn. BR: Is that so! I think it might be autumn, but I'm starting to lose confidence. EE: I think it is correct because I have recently started to see it often at the supermarket. BR: It was good! It's a bit expensive, so I can't eat it very often though. EE: That's right. It feels like fruits have gotten even more expensive recently. BR: Indeed. It seems that the rise in prices is also having an impact. EE: It's sad that it can't be eaten easily. BR: I see. We might have to plant it ourselves. EE: I didn't think of that! For now, should I buy one bulb and try planting the seeds? BR: That's nice! I hope home gardening becomes more popular."
8,"EE: Hello, nice to meet you. FO: Hello. EE: Do you have a favorite food? FO: Hmm, I can't think because I'm so full. EE: What did you have for lunch? FO: ""It's udon. From Marugame Seimen."" EE: It's delicious, isn't it? I liked meat udon. FO: What is in meat udon? EE: It's udon topped with simmered sweet and savory beef. I forgot the official name though. FO: I see, it looks delicious. EE: Basically, it's plain udon, but eating it occasionally makes me happy. FO: I crave quantity, so today I ordered kamaage udon. EE: ""The cost performance is good, isn't it? Kamatama udon is also delicious."" FO: Today I ordered the large portion. EE: ""Tokumori!? I've never had it before... I can't imagine how much there is."" FO: It's one cup. It costs 530 yen. EE: It's about the same as a regular serving of slightly pricey udon, isn't it? FO: I see, I don't really know much about it. EE: Did you post about tempura or anything? FO: ""Wow, it costs a lot both in terms of quantity and money, after all."" EE: ""You're focused on cost performance, right? Is there anything else you often eat besides udon?"" FO: ""Hmm, maybe McDonald's?"" EE: This year's Tsukimi Burger was very delicious. FO: I see, it's an annual tradition, isn't it? EE: That's right. When it's released, I end up eating it. FO: I only order fries and salad at McDonald's recently. EE: I hardly ever buy salad! But when I occasionally eat it, it's delicious. FO: It's a little expensive, isn't it? EE: That's right. If you buy a salad, you end up wanting to eat potatoes. FO: I see, you chose that option."
9,"EE: Hello, nice to meet you. FO: Hello. EE: Do you like sports? FO: ""Not particularly sports."" EE: I see. What do you usually do on your days off? FO: On my days off, I take it easy. EE: Sounds good. Do you play games? FO: I do play games, they are fun, aren't they? EE: It's fun, isn't it? What kind of games do you often play? FO: These days, there are many smartphone games, but the turnover is intense. EE: I see, I hardly play games on my smartphone. Do you have any recommendations? FO: Hmm, wouldn't it be good if the rating had four or more stars? EE: I haven't paid much attention to evaluations. FO: It feels like everyone generally does that because it's safe. EE: ""An app that appeals to everyone, right? I want to play Tsum Tsum again after a long time."" FO: ""Ah, it's famous, isn't it? Was it a puzzle?"" EE: Yes, it's a game where you connect and eliminate pieces. I was really into it when I was in middle school. FO: ""It's a game that has been around for a long time."" EE: I feel like it has a bit of history. Don't you have a Switch or anything? FO: There isn't any. EE: I see. If it's a smartphone, do you also watch YouTube? FO: I will watch it. I will watch it. EE: What kind of videos do you like? FO: Hmm, I guess it's related to anime. Also, things like background music. EE: You're an anime fan, huh? I often watch it on Amazon Prime and such. FO: I watch it occasionally too. Right now, I'm playing Overlord. EE: What is Overlord? FO: It is a dark fantasy based on a novel. The part where the game becomes real is similar to SAO. EE: Since I loved SAO, I will check it out! FO: I'm just playing the SAO game right now."
10,"EE: Hello, nice to meet you. FO: Hello. EE: Do you like animals? FO: I'm just an ordinary person. EE: Are you a dog person or a cat person? FO: ""I've never had one, but is it a cat?"" EE: We're friends, huh? I really love cats. I want to have one someday. FO: Are you living in an apartment now? EE: The apartment doesn't allow pets. FO: I knew it. EE: Is it the same for your house? FO: ""Hmm, well, that might be the case for us too."" EE: Are you living with your parents? FO: Yes, there are a lot of moves, so I don't know the contract details. EE: I understand. I also moved a lot. Regarding pets, I knew about it because it was also my parents' wish. FO: I see. EE: Do you have any plans to live alone? FO: No, not at all. At the very least, it's like a communal living. EE: ""Is it a share house?"" FO: Like that. EE: ""I see, and the rent will also be cheaper."" FO: Rent, or rather, living alone is scary. EE: I understand. If I end up staying somewhere alone, I will sleep with the light on. FO: Do you understand? EE: It becomes scary when there are unseen places because it feels like something might be lurking there. FO: Especially, showers are scary, aren't they? EE: When you close your eyes, you can't grasp the situation around you. FO: ""So you end up showing your back."" EE: Let's open our eyes after splashing water on our backs. FO: ""Hmm, I'm not that skillful."""
11,"EE: Hello, nice to meet you. FO: Hello. EE: What is your favorite season? FO: It is summer. EE: ""That's unusual. Do you not dislike the heat?"" FO: Maybe I am the type who can endure it. EE: I see, I often hear that it's better to be cold because you can take measures by layering up. FO: It's a bit tough when it's cold after taking a bath, isn't it? EE: ""That's certainly true, it's the same when getting out of bed."" FO: Ah, winter is tough. EE: Yes, that's right. What do you like about summer? FO: ""It's a warm place. And, I wonder if it feels like youth."" EE: The image of ""Run towards that sunset!"" is very strong. FO: ""Huh, it definitely won't reach, right?"" EE: ""Isn't it the epitome of youth often seen in dramas!?"" FO: No, I don't know, because I don't watch dramas. EE: I see, when it comes to summer youth, it's got to be Koshien, right? FO: I wonder what the viewership ratings for Koshien are like. EE: There may be few people watching in real time, but there are many who are just following the results. FO: I see, it feels like it's fairly popular. EE: Yes, that's right. I don't watch it much either, but I often hear about it in conversations. FO: When you think about it, there are baseball fans, you know. EE: I see, the image that people who watch professional baseball also watch Koshien is quite strong. FO: ""Was it the draft? Participating in Koshien affects that too, right?"" EE: Indeed, I feel that players who perform well are employed by good teams. FO: Is that so? EE: I'm not very familiar with baseball, so I don't know much, but that's the image I have. FO: I wonder how popular e-sports are. EE: Recently, it seems quite popular. It feels like famous titles such as APEX have increased. FO: It's fun when there are games you know, isn't it?"
12,"EE: Hello, nice to meet you. FO: Hello. EE: Do you have any hobbies? FO: I have various hobbies. EE: For example, what kind of things do you like? FO: I like things like games, reading, and watching the news. EE: ""Sounds good. What kind of books do you often read?"" FO: ""Is it something like a light novel?"" EE: Light novels! I often watch only the anime without reading the original work. FO: That might be good too. EE: Surely there are also benefits to reading in a book. FO: Well, the good thing is you can get ahead of it. Usually, the anime comes later. EE: I see, there seems to be a lot of detailed stories that are not covered in the anime. FO: That's true, from what I know, a lot of short stories are included in the Re:Zero books. EE: Is that so! I watch the anime, so I've become interested in reading the original work too. FO: The original work is interesting, and you can see the main story well enough just on the internet. It's the Empire arc now. EE: I haven't seen the latest yet, so I'll check it out during this three-day weekend! FO: I think it's good. Are you familiar with it up to around the second season of the anime? EE: The episode that left an impression on me is the one with the rabbit. FO: Ah, what was the name again? EE: It's a big rabbit. It's a rabbit with red eyes. FO: In the original work, Echidna talks a bit more, though. EE: I see. It sounds fun to read while making comparisons. FO: The character with the most mysteries in the anime is definitely that character. EE: Which character is it? FO: ""Al, it seems that he will fight seriously soon."" EE: ""Is it Aldebaran? I didn't remember, so I'll seriously review it..."" FO: When Subaru was being attacked with a wooden sword, the Sword Saint appeared, but I think the scene where he intervenes was cut. EE: I see, so that kind of episode was included. FO: If my memory serves me right."
