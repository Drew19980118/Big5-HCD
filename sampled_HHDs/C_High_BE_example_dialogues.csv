1,"BE: Hello! AQ: Hello. BE: What time did you wake up today? AQ: It's 6 o'clock today. BE: Early riser! AQ: The child wakes up early. BE: I see. It's not during summer vacation? AQ: It's summer vacation. BE: Even though it's your day off, it's impressive that you wake up early. AQ: It seems I wake up naturally. BE: Wonderful... AQ: You have a good habit. BE: ""So, do you go to bed early at night?"" AQ: I see. I usually go to bed around 9 PM. BE: It really is early to bed and early to rise. AQ: I hope you will continue this. BE: It seems that habits are hard to break! AQ: I hope so. What time did you wake up? BE: I am around 7 o'clock! AQ: It's plenty early! BE: Even if I wake up early, there's nothing special to do lol. AQ: Haha. But I can finish the housework quickly. BE: Yes, in the mornings I usually do cleaning. AQ: Amazing! Do you clean every day? BE: Almost every day! Because I like cleaning! AQ: I'm really jealous. BE: I'm not good at tidying up. AQ: Yes, yes, I'm not good at either of them. BE: ""The person who is good at it should do it!"" AQ: Let's talk again."
2,"BE: Hello! AQ: Hello. BE: What is your hobby, <AQ>? AQ: Self-taught piano, right? BE: Amazing! And you learned it by yourself? AQ: It's not a big deal. BE: There was a piano lesson, but I was completely hopeless. AQ: ""It's difficult if you haven't learned it, isn't it?"" BE: First of all, I cannot read musical notes instantly. AQ: I might not be able to read it instantly either. BE: ""I was counting them one by one and writing down how to read them."" AQ: Yes, yes, that's enough. Do you have any hobbies? BE: Reading, I guess. AQ: Intelligent! BE: ""It's just like in the manga!"" AQ: No, no! I'm the kind of person who just can't sit still. BE: Isn't the piano staying still? AQ: ""Oh, you're right!"" BE: ""Are you playing while moving? LOL"" AQ: ""That was a sharp remark!"" BE: ""I thought staying still was the best, haha."" AQ: ""It's true! <BE> is so smart!"" BE: That's not true...! AQ: ""Are you into cultural activities?"" BE: Yes, I take pride in that. AQ: ""I got that impression."" BE: Maybe not an active person. AQ: ""Are you an indoor person?"" BE: ""Purely an indoor person."" AQ: I see. Let's talk again."
3,"BE: Hello. AQ: Hello. BE: I bought a printer last week. AQ: Oh, you haven't had one until now? BE: I didn't have it. I've always wanted it though. AQ: As expected, it is convenient to have it. BE: It's nice that you can print photos! AQ: Are you going to print the photos? BE: I bought it to print photos. AQ: Is that so? Can it print nicely? BE: It was fairly expensive, so it's really beautiful! AQ: I see. That sounds nice. BE: I printed out all the photos in my smartphone one after another. AQ: Does the ink run out quickly? BE: It is gone. AQ: That's right! I laughed a little. BE: Ink is surprisingly expensive, isn't it? AQ: It is very expensive. BE: But I want to print, so I bought a lot! AQ: Is it genuine ink? BE: ""Can I use ink other than the genuine one?"" AQ: That's right. There is also something called compatible ink. BE: I didn't know that. AQ: It's already too late since I've already bought it, but I will buy compatible ink on Rakuten Ichiba. BE: I see! It seems cheap on Rakuten. AQ: That's right. You can purchase it for less than half the price of the genuine ink. BE: ""Good information...! Thank you."" AQ: No, no, but the durability and cleanliness might be different. BE: I'll try using it for a bit! See you later. AQ: Well then."
4,"BE: Hello AQ: Hello. BE: Do you have a pet? AQ: I don't have any pets. BE: We have a cat and a hamster. AQ: Oh! It looks lively. BE: I have two cats, but they are always fighting. AQ: ""Are you keeping it indoors?"" BE: ""It's indoors! Because it's an apartment."" AQ: I see. The fight seems intense. BE: After the fight, fur often flies around. AQ: Hahaha. You're really doing it, huh? BE: They are eating each other's hair, it's scary. AQ: ""Eh! Male and female?"" BE: It's male and female! AQ: If it's a man and a woman, wouldn't they fall in love? BE: ""There is no sign of love-love."" AQ: Ahaha! I wonder if they're both hot-tempered. BE: Well, can't we get along? AQ: One day, you might suddenly become close. BE: That might be scary in its own way. AQ: Hahaha. I'm looking forward to seeing how things go from here. BE: I look forward to becoming friends in a few years. AQ: Yes, that's right! Do you have one hamster? BE: There are also two hamsters! AQ: ""I see. You're not fighting, are you?"" BE: Since the cages are separate, there are no fights! AQ: I see! It would be a mess if they were fighting. BE: They say hamster fights are intense. AQ: I see! Let's talk again soon."
5,"BE: Hello. AQ: Hello. BE: What is your favorite drink? AQ: It’s milk. BE: Unexpected answer! AQ: It’s like a child, isn’t it? BE: It looks healthy. AQ: I don't drink coffee or sweet juice. BE: Do you drink milk outside too? AQ: ""No way! But I might drink if I go to a hot spring."" BE: The image after a hot spring is milk, isn't it? I wonder why. AQ: Why is that? It's unclear, right? The bottle one. BE: The one in the bottle! It tastes good, doesn't it? AQ: Oh yes, why does that taste so good? BE: Since I don't like milk, if I have to drink it, I'll go for fruit milk. AQ: ""Ah, yes! The sweet one."" BE: It is so sweet that it burns my throat. AQ: Certainly! It's too sweet! BE: Do you want them to consume sugar? AQ: Hahaha. What do you usually drink? BE: It's coffee or tea. I don't drink juice. AQ: ""Doesn't coffee make you addicted?"" BE: Is it a good kind of addiction? AQ: Yes. BE: Yes, I drink almost every day. AQ: That's right! I've heard it helps you relax. BE: Since the coffee is ground from beans, it has a nice aroma! AQ: Yeah, yeah, I might like the scent. BE: See you next time! AQ: Again!"
6,"BE: Hello. AQ: Hello. BE: Do you drink alcohol? AQ: You don't drink alcohol, do you? BE: I occasionally drink, so I bought a SodaStream. AQ: Wow! That's kind of stylish. BE: It's just a hassle to buy sparkling water every time! AQ: Do you mean mixing sparkling water with alcohol? BE: Yes, it's a carbonated mix. AQ: Oh, I see. BE: Recently, I only use it to mix with vinegar. AQ: What is micho? BE: It's the fruit vinegar one. AQ: That looks delicious. BE: The notation is ""Miso"". AQ: Does your husband also drink? BE: I will drink it by myself! AQ: Are you drinking alone? BE: Oh! My husband also drinks alcohol. AQ: Oh, I see! BE: We drink together at home. AQ: Sounds good! So, you mean we drink different things. BE: That's right, that's right. AQ: Yeah, yeah, it's nice that you can drink together as a couple. BE: Does AQ's husband drink? AQ: We don't drink. BE: It's nice that there's no cost for alcohol! AQ: That amount is being spent on snacks and eating out. BE: I see, so there are costs for snacks. AQ: Sure. Let's talk again."
7,"BE: Hello AQ: Hello. BE: Are you good at sitting in chairs? AQ: Is it a chair? BE: ""Sitting on things like chairs and sofas."" AQ: Ahaha! How should I answer such an unexpected question? BE: When I sit in a chair, I end up sitting with my knees raised. AQ: ""I see, there are people like that, aren't there?"" BE: I think people who can sit beautifully are amazing. AQ: If <BE> decides to try, they can do it too! BE: Before I knew it, I was hugging my knees. AQ: ""Then, what do you do when you eat?"" BE: I am sitting on a chair in the seiza position. AQ: I see, I wonder if it's better to sit down and eat. BE: When eating out, I do my best to stay seated. AQ: I'm doing my best! BE: When I can't keep going, I secretly sit cross-legged on the chair. AQ: ""Ahaha! Stop it."" BE: I'd like to sit properly, though. AQ: On the contrary, I am not good at sitting in the formal Japanese style. BE: ""Are you feeling numb?"" AQ: It goes numb immediately. BE: It's tough during memorial services, isn't it? AQ: That's right. Are you okay, <BE>? BE: I think it's relatively okay. AQ: If it has those advantages, shall we consider it acceptable? BE: ""I am honored to have your approval."" AQ: I'm starting to not understand if I'm being praised or not. BE: Let's talk again! AQ: Yes. Again!"
8,"BE: Hello. AF: Hello. BE: Do you have any pets? AF: When it comes to pets, I keep fish and insects. BE: Fish and insects? That sounds amazing. AF: Insects are for children, and there are two tanks for tropical fish and goldfish. BE: ""Isn't the management difficult?"" AF: That's right, cleaning the fish tank became my husband's job along the way. BE: Water quality management requires attention, doesn't it? We used to keep them too. AF: That's right. What did you have as a pet? BE: It's a tropical fish! I think it's a guppy or something? AF: It's small, isn't it? I think tropical fish are cuter when they're small! BE: Are you raising a big one? AF: I used to keep piranhas, but now I only have small tropical fish. BE: ""Is it a piranha? Amazing!"" AF: Actually, I've always wanted to keep one. It's been a dream of mine. BE: What do piranhas eat? AF: They eat bloodworms, but since the tank can get smelly, they eat carnivorous pellets. BE: ""Oh, so that's a thing, I thought they were eating organisms."" AF: I eat raw fish! When the guppies increased too much, I used them as food. BE: The guppy becoming food! AF: It's a bit sad, though. I thought you would actually buy small fish and keep them in a tank for feeding. BE: ""Preparing the bait is quite a hassle, isn't it?"" AF: Perhaps, their bodies might grow larger with raw fish. BE: I see, do you want to make something like that bigger? AF: Fish that grow large, I definitely want to raise them until they grow big! BE: You feel happy when you see them growing up, don't you? AF: Even though it had grown quite large, I was very sad when it suddenly died. BE: That is a big shock... AF: So for now, I only have small ones. See you later!"
9,"BE: Hello! AF: Hello! BE: Have you bought anything recently? AF: Recently, I've been staying indoors a lot, so I haven't bought anything in particular. BE: It's important to stay inside now. AF: Did you buy something good? BE: Recently, I bought a printer to print photos. AF: Sounds great! Are you going to print the family photos? BE: That's right! Data might disappear someday. AF: On the contrary, I digitized my childhood photos and threw away the physical copies. BE: They say it's better to do it that way to reduce things! AF: I thought I would do a thorough decluttering while I'm still energetic. I'm not particularly attached to my childhood photos. BE: I don't really look back at photos of my childhood, you know. AF: That's right. In case my children or grandchildren want to see it, I've digitized a part of it. BE: I see. It's good because it would be sad to lose it completely! AF: It is recommended. If it becomes unnecessary, it is easy to dispose of since it is data. BE: I agree, throwing away photos is a bit... well, you know. AF: If it's yours, it's easier to throw away. Have you thrown away anything recently? BE: Maybe I just threw away clothes or something? AF: You need to regularly review your clothes, or they'll keep piling up! BE: ""I'm moving soon, so I'm thinking of getting rid of as many unnecessary things as possible!"" AF: That's great! When you move, don't you end up with a ton of unwanted kitchen items? BE: It's extremely messy. Moreover, it's a non-flammable material. AF: Oh yes, sorting waste can be a hassle. But it's a good opportunity! BE: That's right, I'm thinking of replacing all the tableware with new ones. AF: ""That might be a good idea too—I switched all my dishes to white ones when I moved."" BE: White tableware is nice! It looks beautiful when everything matches. AF: The visible parts of the kitchen cabinet are only white dishes. BE: I see, it looks good! AF: Yes, that's right. Good luck with tidying up after the move! See you later."
10,"BE: Hello! EJ: Hello. BE: Do you have a favorite drink? EJ: Ginger ale has become my recent favorite! BE: I like ginger ale too! EJ: ""It's delicious, isn't it? The authentic ginger ale I had at the burger shop the other day was delicious."" BE: Is it a bit spicy? EJ: Yes! It was quite spicy. It had ginger paste in it. BE: I drank something like that at a pancake shop. EJ: Stores like that also have craft cola and such, which is nice. BE: There are quite a lot of slightly luxurious drinks, aren't there? EJ: Certainly. There are many things that are not found in regular bottled drinks. BE: But that ginger ale was too spicy, so I couldn't drink it all! EJ: There are some quite spicy ones, aren't there? Are you not good with spicy food? BE: I'm not good with spicy foods, but I love wasabi. EJ: Wasabi is okay for you! BE: I'm not good with painful chili peppers. EJ: I understand. Sometimes it really hurts, it's too painful. BE: It hurts even more when it's hot, doesn't it? EJ: That's true. The heat amplifies the spiciness. So, I choose medium spiciness for curry. BE: I also prefer medium spicy curry! EJ: I knew it! Personally, I find medium spicy the most delicious! BE: If it’s sweet, it feels lacking. EJ: That's right. But when it gets really spicy, it starts to become more about enjoying the spiciness rather than the dish itself. BE: Certainly. There are quite a few foods that prioritize spiciness, aren't there? EJ: Since the super spicy trend, there are more ways to market dishes like ""Our food is this spicy!"" BE: I see, I don't really understand why spicy food is considered good. EJ: ""I understand the feeling of wanting to challenge oneself with spicy food, but I prefer it in moderation."" BE: I'm worried that you might get a stomachache. EJ: That certainly makes you worried."
11,"BE: Hello! AQ: Hello! BE: Have you been surprised by anything lately? AQ: Hmm, I was surprised and happy when the artist I wanted to see as a guest appeared at the festival I went to over the weekend. BE: Was it a surprise appearance? AQ: Yes, it was a surprise. Have you ever been surprised in reverse? BE: ""If it's something trivial, just one."" AQ: What is it? BE: It was not common nationwide for an egg to be placed under the Napolitan. AQ: I heard for the first time that there is an egg under the Napolitan. BE: Really? Is it laid out? AQ: I didn't know that, is it only in that area? BE: It seems so. Even though it's delicious. AQ: I see, I thought Napolitan was just pasta. BE: ""It's served on a hot iron plate. I thought it was a staple of coffee shops."" AQ: I see, this is the first time I've heard that. BE: ""Recently, there have only been such trivial surprises!"" AQ: That's not true, there are things that vary by region, you know. BE: Sometimes we use dialects without even realizing it! AQ: Yes, there is, since I'm in Tokyo, I sometimes wonder what it means the other way around. BE: Are you also from Tokyo? AQ: Yes, it is Tokyo. BE: ""Then it's a beautiful word!"" AQ: ""That's not true, but there are times when I can't understand dialects at all."" BE: It's troubling when you don't understand anything at all, isn't it? AQ: I see, but there are many cute dialects, so I think those are adorable. BE: My region is known for having an un-cute dialect, so I admire cute dialects. AQ: Is that so? Dialects often spread quite a bit, don't they? BE: If it's something strong like the Kansai dialect, it gets picked up. AQ: ""Right! Sometimes it gets weirdly transferred."
12,"BE: Hello! AQ: Hello! BE: Do you have a pet? AQ: No, I don't have a pet. I've never had one. BE: ""I see, taking care of things must be tough."" AQ: Living alone, it's troublesome when you're away. BE: ""It will be difficult to stay overnight, won't it?"" AQ: At this time of year, you might need to keep the air conditioner running. BE: Sure, we have pets at home, so it's on all the time. AQ: What are you keeping as a pet? BE: ""Cat and hamster!"" AQ: ""That's nice. Have you had the cat for a long time?"" BE: It was about 2 years ago that I got a cat. AQ: ""Did you start keeping the kitten?"" BE: Originally, my husband was the one who kept it, so I'm not very familiar with it, haha. AQ: I see. Do you give Chao Churu? BE: ""There's none, but I kind of want to try giving it a bit."" AQ: ""I'm curious if it really bites like in the commercial."" BE: Certainly, it is indeed lonely when the response is poor. AQ: The pet food section also has a wide variety, doesn't it? BE: ""Yes, it's always the same, so I don't really pay much attention to what's around me!"" AQ: ""Using Makurazaki tuna! There was cat food, and I thought they are eating better food than humans."" BE: There are people who give things like that somewhere, right? AQ: Nowadays, there are people who spend money on their pets. BE: Clothing and haircuts are amazing, aren't they? AQ: I think it has become a big market. BE: It seems that the market is expanding due to COVID-19. AQ: As the time spent at home increases, the time to play with pets also increases. BE: It's wonderful to have pets around for a long time! AQ: ""They say it's good for your mental health too. Thank you very much."
