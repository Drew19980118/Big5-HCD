1,"GQ: Hello, nice to meet you. EB: Hello - nice to meet you too. GQ: After the typhoon passed, it became very cool, didn't it? EB: That's right, it might drop below 20 degrees at night. GQ: I didn't prepare the futon, so I feel like I'm going to catch a cold. EB: Haha, we are still using a towel blanket. GQ: ""I also need to wash the blanket because I was fighting over the towel blanket with my child."" EB: ""Yes, we should start preparing soon."" GQ: I need to prepare long sleeves too. EB: ""I have put out a few long-sleeved shirts, but I think it's not quite necessary yet."" GQ: Since I only prepared a light jacket, I also need to bring out something to wear underneath. EB: ""It's tough to put them away and take them out, isn't it?"" GQ: I see. Do you switch out your clothes yourself? EB: The whole family will do it together. GQ: Great job! I have to do it almost entirely by myself. EB: I think that is tough! It’s quite heavy! GQ: I have a backlog of taking my children's old clothes to the recycle shop, so I can't get it sorted out. EB: Ah, I see! Nowadays, they come to pick it up for you! GQ: Since I don't have such luxury items, I feel hesitant and will only bring my own. EB: You shouldn't worry about that anymore, since it's a service like that, you have to use it! GQ: I will definitely try it next time. EB: Yeah, yeah, it's better if we can reduce the burden. GQ: Donating used clothes is also an option, right? EB: That's true! Facilities are quite pleased with it. GQ: I was thinking that maybe I didn't need it, but I might give it a try. EB: Yes, yes, please try various things! It's become more convenient. GQ: There are options where you just pack it in a cardboard box without bearing the shipping cost, aren't there? EB: Yes, yes, as long as I have cardboard, I'm fine. GQ: We have so much that the house will be full right away. EB: ""We don't really keep that many cardboard boxes."""
2,"GQ: Hello, nice to meet you. EB: Thank you in advance. GQ: Do you play video games? EB: ""I only play games for work or with my kids."" GQ: Your job is related to games, isn't it? We have an elementary school boy, so it's all about the Switch. EB: ""It's not related to games, but as a translator, I work on translating and localizing overseas games."" GQ: There is such a job, isn't there? It will be a reference for my child's future. EB: Before the coronavirus, I had a lot of work overseas, but now I do more translation work at home, like for dramas and movies. GQ: It's my dream job. I love Western movies. EB: I see! If I say too much, it will be obvious, so I've probably localized a movie you know. GQ: Amazing! But I haven't been to the movie theater recently. EB: It's quite difficult to get around, you know. When I went to see Evangelion, it was pretty empty. GQ: Our high school student finally started watching foreign films with subtitles with us. EB: ""Yeah, yeah, for some movies I really recommend the subtitles."" GQ: That's right. It's difficult to watch with subtitles when the children are young. EB: Certainly, that's true. In our household, we speak in different languages inside the house to get used to a foreign language environment. GQ: I respect you! I've failed many times because my parents can't speak. EB: Ah, that's quite tough. I think the fact that the parents need to talk first is significant. GQ: That's why I'm determined to have my children study abroad. EB: I see, if you are going to study abroad, I recommend the UK. GQ: You can speak beautiful English, right? Did you study in the UK? EB: I am self-taught in English. The reason why the UK is good is because it has the most advanced independent education in the world. GQ: Education that fosters independence is important, isn't it? EB: Yeah, yeah, it doesn't mean anything if you study a lot and gain knowledge but can't do anything on your own. GQ: I understand. Maybe the kids' room is already separate? EB: The top is separate. GQ: We have a bunk bed with two people on the top, and the elementary school child still sleeps with me. EB: ""I don't mind if you rely on me, but I've decided to do things for myself if I can."" GQ: Wonderful! I have the same idea, but we haven't been able to put it into practice. EB: ""It depends on the environment, so there's not much we can do about it."""
3,"GQ: Good evening. FO: Good evening. GQ: Are you working? Or are you a student? FO: I am a student. It feels precarious. GQ: ""Is it the credits? The precarious one."" FO: ""That's one reason, and sometimes I can't get up in the morning."" GQ: Well, if you're awake at this time, it's pretty bad, isn't it? FO: ""Well, there's that, but my sleep schedule is reversed."" GQ: What are you doing in the middle of the night? FO: I really couldn't sleep last night. GQ: My middle schooler says they can't sleep and is looking at their smartphone. FO: Well, I'm not denying that I'm looking at my smartphone, but it's because I can't sleep. GQ: Blue light keeps you awake. FO: Hmm, I take sleeping pills and they make me sleepy during the day, so I think carefully before taking them. GQ: Sleeping pills! That is serious. FO: ""It's not that the symptoms are particularly severe, but I received something to fix my rhythm."" GQ: Is it no good even if you move your body during the day? FO: Let's change the subject. GQ: Understood. I'm sorry. FO: No. GQ: Do you watch movies? FO: I don't watch movies very often. I think the last one I saw was Eva. GQ: ""Eva, isn't it recent?"" FO: I see, it was recent. GQ: Was that the final chapter? Was it good? FO: Hmm, for me, it's a bit iffy. GQ: I only watch Evangelion as a TV anime. FO: ""Is that so? I'm the opposite; I only know the new theatrical version."" GQ: That's right. It's a different generation. FO: That might be so."
4,"GQ: Good evening. FO: Good evening. GQ: Do you like games? FO: Yes, I love it. GQ: ""Is it a PC? Do you want to play Switch?"" FO: It's a PC or a smartphone. GQ: Right now, our household is excited about Splatoon 3. FO: I see, it's great that the Switch games appeal to a wide range of generations. GQ: But I am still a Fortnite fan. FO: What is Fortnite again? GQ: ""It's the one where you build and defeat opponents. What kind do you play?"" FO: The game on smartphones has been changing rapidly lately, and now it's Sword Art Online. GQ: I see. I don't understand. That's unfortunate. FO: ""Think of it as a late-night anime game."" GQ: I see. Elementary school students are playing a game called Touhou something. Is it the same genre? FO: ""Uh, Touhou is unique, isn't it? It's a bullet hell game, I think. I'm not very familiar with it, though."" GQ: Yes, yes, it's not an anime. It's YouTube. FO: Uh, it's a game. GQ: Oh, I see. The game came first. I should stop talking about things I don't know about. FO: I think they're probably talking about the duo with faces that look like mochi on YouTube. GQ: ""That's it, they're speaking in a strange voice."" FO: It's famous, isn't it? It must be convenient because you can have someone else talk for you when you don't want to speak yourself. GQ: I see. If it's Demon Slayer, I went to watch the movie. FO: How was it? GQ: I cried a lot. Because I love Rengoku-san. FO: Ah, you made a movie of exactly the right part. GQ: I cried too much, and my child told me it was embarrassing. FO: You cried that much. GQ: My eyes swelled up, and then I was quite troubled. FO: I have only ever cried my eyes out at movies when it rains or snows."
5,"GQ: Good evening. GL: Good evening! GQ: Did you go out during the long holiday? GL: No, I just went out to my house and did a little shopping! Did you go out anywhere? GQ: I drove for about six hours alone to accompany the children's tournament, and I'm exhausted. GL: I see. Thank you for your hard work! Was it a round trip? GQ: Yes, it's two and a half hours one way, five hours round trip, plus a bit of leisurely driving, making it six hours. GL: I see. Was the road congested? GQ: On the way back, there was a traffic jam on the highway, so I took a side road partway. GL: As expected, it was crowded during the rush hour on the way back. Sometimes the local roads are faster, right? GQ: Yes, I avoided the traffic jam because it seemed like it would make me sleepy. GL: I see. Do you often go on expeditions with your child? GQ: Due to COVID-19, there were no tournaments for about two years, but this year they are being held at a pace of once a month. GL: I see. Many restrictions have been lifted this year. Are you good at driving? GQ: ""Whether I'm good at it or not, I like it."" GL: I see, if you like driving, long-distance driving can be enjoyable too! GQ: Yes, I enjoyed the autumn scenery. I wasn't driving distracted, though. GL: I see! The trees have already started to change color! GQ: The silver grass was beautiful! Do you go for drives? GL: Was it pampas grass! Yes, I often drive for nearby shopping and for about an hour's errands! GQ: Do you have any plans to go out this autumn? GL: As of now, I don't have any plans, but I'm thinking a little about going shopping at the outlet! GQ: That's nice! My daughters are pestering me too. GL: I see! Depending on the location, you can enjoy the scenery, and it's great that you can go for a day trip! GQ: Yes, if you can just tolerate the crowds, you can enjoy a wonderful day-trip experience. GL: I haven't been to the outlet recently, but is it still crowded? Last year it wasn't that crowded! GQ: The place we are going to is very crowded with traffic. GL: I see! It can get crowded depending on the location. It is indeed tiring when it’s crowded. GQ: As long as we can secure a parking space, we'll manage somehow. GL: That's right. I hope it's not crowded!"
6,"GQ: Good evening. GL: Good evening, thank you in advance! GQ: Is there anything you are into lately? GL: Yes. I've been into yoga for a little while now! GQ: Oh! Yoga! That sounds nice. GL: I'm not attending any classes, but I do some light yoga at home after a bath and before bed! GQ: Did you use YouTube as a reference? GL: That's right! That's right! I search for the body parts I want to stretch and do the simple ones! GQ: When I had a lot of time at home because of COVID, I did it a little bit too. GL: Yes, the start for me was also spending time at home! I got motivated once I bought a yoga mat! GQ: Ah! Nice. I was wondering whether to buy a yoga mat or not, and decided against it. GL: ""I bought cheap items on sale! Also, I lightly do it on the bed before going to sleep!"" GQ: Do you think buying tools helps you keep going? I just can't seem to keep at it. GL: Ah, but it's really just a light stretch! The serious stuff makes you sweat and it's tough! GQ: Don't you want to try going to HOT yoga or something? GL: ""I want to go! I once participated in a course held at the civic hall, and it was fun!"" GQ: Since my body is stiff, it's painful, but I understand the feeling of enjoyment. GL: I see, you have to take it slow or you'll hurt yourself. Consistency is important, right? GQ: The simple one that was introduced on NHK, maybe I'll search for it and start again. GL: By all means! I think yoga is something you don't have to push yourself and can do little by little! GQ: That's right. It also makes you feel mentally refreshed. GL: Yes, as expected, my neck and lower back get quite stiff, so this helps me relax. It's easier to do with a yoga mat! GQ: Yes, yes, I'll look for a yoga mat online too! GL: Having the right tools can sometimes boost your motivation. I am the type who starts with the gear. GQ: ""I understand how you feel! That's important!"" GL: Also, the mindset of having to get your money's worth for what you bought kicks in, whether that's good or not... GQ: No, no. It's like the chicken or the egg, but it's all good. GL: Is that so? After that, if I can experience it physically and make it part of my routine, it should be OK. GQ: Yes, health comes first! Let's do our best! GL: I will continue to strive to maintain my health in the future!"
7,"GQ: Good morning! GD: Good morning. GQ: Did you have breakfast? GD: Yes, I put a fried egg on the toast. GQ: You are eating well. I am having rice porridge made from last night's leftover hot pot. GD: Have you already had a hot pot? GQ: Our family does it even in the summer. But recently, it's about once a week. GD: ""That's quite frequent, isn't it? What kind of ingredients do you use in the summer?"" GQ: ""It hasn't changed much. There are a lot of shabu-shabu places, even though it's hot."" GD: It's good to warm up from the inside. You may not notice it, but air conditioning can make your body cold from the inside. GQ: Yes, yes, I'd like to say it's good for your health, but it's just laziness. GD: ""Is the dipping sauce store-bought? There are a lot of them now, aren't there?"" GQ: ""I occasionally use it, but most often I make hot pot with broth from kelp."" GD: ""Oh, it's simple. I usually use store-bought ones because they are convenient. Is it ponzu?"" GQ: Yes, our household consumes a lot of ponzu sauce. GD: Since we started being mindful of reducing salt, we use ponzu for everything. It's convenient, isn't it? For dipping or simmering. GQ: I understand. It's also popular with children, so we use it in various ways. GD: Is ponzu popular? I thought kids only liked mayonnaise. When it comes to hot pot broth, I imagine sesame sauce. GQ: Our family uses ponzu sauce. We put it on everything. I prefer mayonnaise. GD: ""Didn't mayonnaise in the past have more acidity than it does now?"" GQ: Ah, I kind of get it. GD: My husband disliked mayo because it was sour, but he recently learned that there are non-sour ones and now he can eat it. GQ: ""There's such a big difference, isn't there? Mayo is also quite convenient and helpful, isn't it?"" GD: ""There are more varieties now, right? Since it's convenient to use, I was troubled when someone said they didn't like mayo."" GQ: Certainly! I use it mixed with eggs when I make an omelette. GD: Ah, it's definitely a delicious one! I'll put it directly on steamed vegetables. I feel like mayonnaise has improved its image thanks to Masaharu Fukuyama. GQ: ""That commercial is sneaky, isn't it? The mayo on the omelette makes it easier to cook. Please give it a try!"" GD: ""I'll give it a try! Stir-frying vegetables with mayonnaise like in the commercial is delicious, right? It gives it a rich flavor."" GQ: I haven't done that before, so I'll give it a try! GD: Fried rice becomes delicious when you slightly burn some mayonnaise on the side of the pan and stir-fry it together."
8,"GQ: Good morning. GD: Good morning. GQ: Do you have any pets? GD: I used to have a rabbit. GQ: I've had one too! GD: ""Uh, what kind was it? Mine had droopy ears called a lop-eared rabbit."" GQ: ""It's a Nether mix. Its ears were standing up."" GD: ""It's a small breed, right? Did it get bigger because it's a mix?"" GQ: At first, it was palm-sized, but it got fairly big. However, it wasn't to the point of being troublesome. GD: I was also a baby at first, so I was palm-sized. Rabbits are just the right size. GQ: Yes, I currently have a dog and a cat, but how easy would it be if I had a rabbit of that size? GD: ""Is it one at a time? Feeding and walking them seems difficult."" GQ: Yes, the cost of food is putting a strain on the household budget. We have one dog and one to two cats, depending on the day. GD: Daily special! It's like ""Lady and the Tramp."" GQ: Originally, we only had dogs, but since we keep them outside, a cat has settled in. GD: Are you coming to see the dog? GQ: ""At first, they came to eat the dog's food, but the one we have now was raised on the dog's milk."" GD: Oh, a nurse cat. Did it get separated from its mother? GQ: ""It seems so. But my dog hasn't given birth."" GD: ""Did it start coming out due to maternal instinct? How mysterious."" GQ: It’s truly mysterious. Motherhood is amazing, isn’t it? GD: ""I've heard that even humans experience such things. But it's amazing that it transcends species."" GQ: Certainly. Other cats tend to come home only occasionally as they grow up, but that one has always stayed with us. GD: I absolutely think of them as my parents. Have they become a house cat that doesn't go outside? GQ: No, no, since we keep the dog in the garage, the cat also goes out to play. GD: I see. Even if they go outside, they think it's their home and come back, right? Do you make food for them? GQ: No, I buy the dry ones. The recent price increases are so bad, I feel like crying. GD: Wow, even feed has gone up in price. Starting from yesterday, various things have gone up again. It's tough for people too. GQ: It really makes me feel depressed every time I go shopping. GD: It's not a good price increase."
9,"GQ: Thank you in advance. GD: Thank you in advance. GQ: ""It's the season of good appetite, but are you thinking about dieting?"" GD: I think about it. In the first place, since I am above my ideal weight, I spend all year thinking about it while being lazy. GQ: Thinking, sluggishly, comrades. GD: Yay. I'm not good at exercising. I couldn't keep up with walking either. GQ: But since I'm doing radio exercises, won't my waist become more defined? GD: Not really. I don't feel like there's any change in my body shape. It just feels like my blood is circulating and my body is waking up. GQ: For your health, it feels like that's just right! GD: Yes. Shoulder stiffness and lower back pain have reduced. GQ: I had my rice bowl taken by my child and am using the child's bowl, but I keep getting seconds, making it pointless. GD: I can't help but have a second helping of freshly cooked rice. It can't be helped. GQ: Thank you very much. The cooking has become my favorite flavor, so I can't stop. GD: That's right. Even if I ask for requests, I don't get much of an answer, so I end up making what I want to eat. GQ: Got it! I always say, ""Think about the menu!"" GD: It would be nice if there was something I really wanted to eat, but it's not always the case, so it's troubling when there's nothing. GQ: The child always says ""Hamburger!"" It's tough without it... GD: It’s tough when the refrigerator isn’t empty, but you can’t think of anything. GQ: I saw on TV that having a family meeting over the weekend to plan the menu for the week in advance is a good idea, but we only practiced it for two weeks. GD: Did anyone share their opinions? GQ: ""It came out fairly well. I decided on the framework with Japanese, Western, and Chinese styles, and did it."" GD: Has it become easier to cook while you're able to do it? GQ: But in the end, there were times when I didn't have enough time and my schedule got messed up, so it might not have been easy. GD: As expected, things don't go as planned. Thinking about what can be done with what we have now, I feel like three days' worth is the limit. GQ: That's right, that's right. That's how it feels now. GD: ""A week feels long, doesn't it? I don't think the materials will circulate well."" GQ: Considering the shelf life of the ingredients, a pace of three days is good, isn't it? GD: ""It might be a good idea to decide the menu within that span."" GQ: Yeah, yeah. Maybe I'll give it a try. GD: I think I'll give it a try too!"
10,"GQ: Thank you in advance. GD: Thank you in advance. GQ: Do you often eat out? GD: About three times a month. GQ: ""Do you have any favorite stores?"" GD: There is a yakiniku restaurant in the neighborhood, and although I've lived here for 5 years, I go once a month. GQ: ""Is it delicious meat?"" GD: It used to be delicious, but recently it's not as good. It might just be a coincidence though. GQ: I understand! There are places that aren't stable, right? GD: The first manager was friendly and spoke to me, so I liked the place. After the fire incident, I can't take my eyes off it. GQ: People are important. Fire is scary! Was everything okay in the neighborhood? GD: Yes. Because it was the only store. Initially, it was charcoal, but after a fire, it was renovated and switched to gas. GQ: Even so, it's good that you recovered. The yakiniku restaurant in the city disappeared after the fire. GD: That's right. I was worried that it might close like this. I was also worried when it closed temporarily due to COVID-19. GQ: It seems that the restaurant business on our side was doing great during the COVID-19 closures. GD: ""Eh, why is that? Did you make money from deliveries or something?"" GQ: No, no, if you run a small business on your own land and building, it seems the subsidies are more than the usual sales. GD: I see! Now that you mention it, I think I saw it on the news. GQ: Yes, some politicians have said that it is different between rural and urban areas. GD: ""At that time, it seemed especially tough for the major companies, didn't it?"" GQ: That's right. Around here, there were many people buying new cars, building houses, and prosperous restaurants. GD: That's good. When the situation with COVID-19 calmed down a bit and I walked through the streets of Tokyo, quite a few restaurants had closed down, and it made me feel sad. GQ: Got it! The stylish café that rented the store has disappeared. GD: The rented shops are struggling, aren't they? In my impression, non-chain ramen shops have disappeared. GQ: Ah, maybe the number of ramen shops has decreased. It's unfortunate, isn't it? GD: The office district must have become empty of people. GQ: Certainly. It was online, after all. Was your husband at home too? GD: I started my first remote work just last week. I thought it was slow for an IT-related job. GQ: Oh, it certainly might be late. GD: Due to company regulations, we can't share customer information outside. I thought it was kind of annoying."
11,"GQ: Hello! GD: Hello. GQ: Do you have plans for the long weekend? GD: ""At the moment, no. We were talking about wanting to go to karaoke for the first time in a while."" GQ: Karaoke is often begged for by the children. GD: You're good at singing. GQ: No, no, it's just because they like it. They won't let me sing. They want to sing themselves. GD: Oh, it's not ""sing"" but ""take me with you."" GQ: Yes, yes! Excuse me. What kind of songs do you sing? GD: There are a lot of anime songs. Also, there's Gen Hoshino. GQ: Hoshino Gen is great, isn't he? GD: Yes. There are usually music videos, and it's fun to sing and listen to them. What songs do kids nowadays sing? GQ: ""It's a song that's popular on Vocaloid and TikTok."" GD: TikTok! It seems it's no longer the era when music becomes popular through TV programs. GQ: ""But it's interesting that old songs also become popular. Right now, it's 'Ai no Shirushi' by PUFFY."" GD: Wow, nostalgic. Speaking of which, wasn't ""Megumi no Hito"" popular a while ago? GQ: Yes, yes. I often get asked, ""Do you know your mother?"" GD: It's nice to have songs in common. GQ: But, I can't sing at karaoke. It's sad. GD: ""Hehehe, you won't let go of the microphone, will you?"" GQ: Yes, that's right! GD: If you could sing, what song would you sing? GQ: I'm from the Dreams Come True generation, so there's a lot of Dreams Come True music. I also like Aiko. GD: ""I see. DREAMS COME TRUE might be a bit better."" GQ: What kind of music is in the anime? GD: There are a lot from the 90s. I don't understand many of the recent ones. GQ: ""I would like to try singing the theme song of the Jujutsu Kaisen movie."" GD: ""Are you talking about the movie? What was it again? The one with '0', right?"" GQ: Yes, it's the King Gnu one. I think it's difficult and impossible. GD: ""That seems difficult."""
12,"GQ: Good morning! EB: Good morning. GQ: Did you have breakfast? EB: I haven't eaten. How about you? GQ: I made do with a fried egg. EB: Is it only fried eggs? GQ: It comes with ham. There's no vegetables. EB: I see. You can't eat much in the morning, can you? GQ: Are you okay without breakfast? EB: No problem at all. GQ: ""Do you usually not eat?"" EB: I don't always eat it. Do you eat it every day? GQ: Yes, I always eat because I have children. EB: That's important. I used to eat it when I was a child. GQ: Are you living alone? EB: That's right. GQ: I was like that too when I lived alone. EB: ""That happens, doesn't it? It takes effort."" GQ: Are you going to make dinner? EB: ""I'll make lunch and dinner. As much as possible."" GQ: Oh! Impressive! What are you good at? EB: It's only simple dishes like pork kimchi and yakisoba. GQ: But, it's impressive that you make it properly. EB: I thought I should eat vegetables. GQ: Somehow, I end up taking a mother's perspective, but it is reassuring. EB: But, I gained weight since I started living alone. GQ: Eh! Is it because you started drinking alcohol? EB: ""Rather, I think it's because I can eat as much of what I like as I want."" GQ: You have to be careful about that, it's dangerous. EB: I will be careful. Things like sweets."
