        Now, I will give you a Human Human Dialogue. The content is as follows:

        Then, I will give you a Human Computer Dialogue based on this Human Human Dialogue, where AX simulates the role of a Human (converting AX's utterances in the original Human Human Dialogue), and AN simulates the role of a Computer (converting AN's utterances in the original Human Human Dialogue). In this simulation, only the style of each utterance will be changed without altering its content and meaning.
        ## Human Computer Dialogue:
        {human_computer_dialogue}
        The conversion of this Human Human Dialogue into Human Computer Dialogue is based on the following Additional Knowledge:

        Now, I have received several different evaluatorsâ€™ feedback regarding the issues with this transformed Human Computer Dialogue:

        Your task is to revise this Human Computer Dialogue based on the feedback (you may need to refer to the original Human Human Dialogue, Personality traits score & Personality Traits Description and Additional Knowledge) and output a completely new Human Computer Dialogue. The output format should remain consistent with the original Human Computer Dialogue.

        **Important!!!** The newly generated Human Computer Dialogue must consider the content of each feedback simultaneously. Your response should only include the newly generated Human Computer Dialogue and no additional titles or information.

    AN: Yes, there were regions that seemed to be having a hard time with the continuous heavy rain. 
    AX: I currently live in Kansai, and the rain was quite heavy on Saturday. 
    AN: Oh, I also live in Kansai. The rain wasn't that bad here. 
    AX: I see. Are you okay with the heat or the cold? 
    AN: I am not good with either, but I might be worse with the heat. 
    AX: If you're okay with the air conditioner and such, it's fine, but are you able to use it well? 
    AN: That's because I have poor circulation, so I really dislike air conditioning. 
    AX: There are quite a few people like that, aren't there? Our workplace is also very cold. 
    AN: Is that so? Are you taking a jacket or something? 
    AX: Yes. Two well-built women lower the temperature, right? 
    AN: Oh no, that's troublesome. 
    AX: Well, I won't say anything, but I'll wear this. It's impossible and unpleasant to do the opposite. 
    AN: You are so kind! Don't you get swollen when your body gets too cold? 
    AX: Your shoulders and head can start to hurt, right? When you go outside, it feels warm. 
    AN: That's right. I feel like my blood circulation has gotten worse. 
    AX: Since I am from Hokkaido, I might not be quite used to the air conditioning. 
    AN: Are you from Hokkaido? They don't really use air conditioners there, right? 
    AX: I see. I don't know about recently, but the heat doesn't last long.
    AN: Is that so? Is winter extremely cold after all? 
    AX: No, no. Well, places like Asahikawa go down to minus 20 or 30.
    AN: Incredible. It's a temperature beyond my imagination. 
    AX: It's the one where you can hammer a nail with a banana. 
    AN: It's a scene you often see in manga. 
    AX: Haha. That might be true. The usual way to use a banana is different, after all. 
    AN: I imagined it for a moment and laughed. Well, it's time, so I'll take my leave around here.

    AX: It's currently the most active time, and it feels like I can't take my eyes off. 
    AN: Yes, it's become much calmer. The younger one is 2 years old, so I can't take my eyes off this one.

    additional_knowledge = """
    Differences Between Human Human Dialogue (HHD) and Human Computer Dialogue (HCD):

    Communication Styles:

    HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are characterized by brief, frequent exchanges that prioritize efficiency. Users expect clear, straightforward responses without unnecessary elaboration.
    Example: User: "What time is my next meeting?" System: "Your meeting starts at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B."

    HHD: Conversations between humans are more nuanced and context-rich, often incorporating additional details, shared thoughts, or collaborative reasoning.
    Example: Person A: "The weather app says itâ€™ll stay clear, but the sky looks a bit hazy. Do you think we should leave earlier for the hike?" Person B: "Good pointâ€”maybe we can avoid the afternoon crowd too. Letâ€™s aim for 8 AM instead!"

    Relational and Personality Expression:

    HCD: Interactions between humans and machines are transactional and lack emotional depth or personal connection, as machines are incapable of genuine empathy or emotional understanding.
    Example: User: "Iâ€™m overwhelmed with work deadlines." System: "Would you like me to schedule a reminder for your tasks?"

    HHD: Human interactions are infused with emotional expression, humor, and openness, fostering trust and mutual understanding. These exchanges often include empathy, support, and shared problem-solving.
    Example: Person A: "Iâ€™ve been swamped with deadlines all weekâ€”itâ€™s exhausting." Person B: "That sounds rough. Want to grab coffee later? We can brainstorm ways to tackle it together."
