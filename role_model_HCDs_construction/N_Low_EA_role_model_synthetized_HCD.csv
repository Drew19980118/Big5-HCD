1,"EA: Hello!
CP: Hello!  
EA: 'It's been hot lately, hasn't it? Are you doing anything to cope with it?'  
CP: 'I put up the bamboo blinds!'  
EA: 'Is it a sudare? Can you remind me what kind it is?'  
CP: It’s a grass-woven covering for windows.  
EA: Oh, right! Is it used to open windows?  
CP: No, it blocks sunlight even when the windows are closed, creating shade.  
EA: 'So, it's like a curtain?'  
CP: Actually, I wanted a green curtain.  
EA: 'What’s a green curtain?'  
CP: It's when you grow plants like gourds on nets hanging from the house.  
EA: 'A plant curtain! Is it hard to maintain?'  
CP: Goya is easy to grow, but setting up the net is tricky.  
EA: Really! Can you eat the bitter melon?  
CP: Yes, it’s quite tasty!  
EA: 'It’s tasty, though I didn’t like it as a kid.'  
CP: Same here. I started liking it as an adult.  
EA: Veggies often grow on you with age, like eggplants.  
CP: Especially summer vegetables!  
EA: Summer veggies are great! Cucumbers remind me of getting older.  
CP: Cucumber! Perfect for fresh bites in season.  
EA: 'Fresh and tasty! Good with alcohol too.'  
CP: Exactly! How do you cook bitter melon?  
EA: 'I know goya champuru. Any other recipes?'  
CP: Champuru is great! I also make tsukudani and salad.  
EA: Both sound good! I might try them.  
CP: You should! Salad with canned tuna is good too!  
EA: 'Easy to make and perfect for summer.'  
CP: Yes, and it pairs well with alcohol!"
2,"EA: Nice to meet you, hello.
CP: Hello! How can I assist you today?  
EA: Did you take any lessons or classes when you were a child?  
CP: Yes, I took piano and swimming lessons.  
EA: Do you still like piano and swimming?  
CP: I can't read sheet music for the piano anymore, but I still swim regularly.  
EA: Does that mean you didn't play the piano for a very long period of time?  
CP: Actually, I've been playing quite a bit and can even perform some difficult pieces.  
EA: Is that so? It's impressive that you can play without reading sheet music!  
CP: Yes, it's quite unique. My teacher was surprised too.  
EA: It feels like you've memorized the pieces with your fingers. That's quite a talent!  
CP: Thank you, but I think it's more about guessing and muscle memory.  
EA: I see. Are you very good at swimming since you've been doing it for a long time?  
CP: My speed isn't as fast as it used to be, but I can swim continuously for one or two kilometers.  
EA: Wow, that's impressive! I struggle with even 25 meters.  
CP: Did you take any lessons in swimming or any other sports?  
EA: I played tennis for about 4 to 5 years.  
CP: Tennis! That's great! Did you start in elementary school?  
EA: I started in middle school. My friends invited me. I'm not that good at it though!  
CP: Was it hardball tennis?  
EA: Yes, it was hardball. I also experienced softball in school, but it was very different.  
CP: Softball for fun, you mean?  
EA: Yes, hitting with full strength was fun in softball, but hardball really trained my grip strength.  
CP: Interesting! What's your grip strength?  
EA: Around 50. How about you?  
CP: That's impressive. Mine is probably less than 20.  
EA: It seems like grip strength improves with training.  
CP: I agree. Consistent training is key.  
EA: In hardball tennis, a strong grip is essential to keep the racket from flying away.  
CP: I see! I wasn't aware of that!"
