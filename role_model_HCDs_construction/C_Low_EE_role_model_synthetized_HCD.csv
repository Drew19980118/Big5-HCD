1,"EE: Hello, nice to meet you.
BL: Hello. Nice to meet you.
EE: What do you do on your days off?
BL: Checking my smartphone, shopping, and studying.
EE: That's nice. What do you usually do on your smartphone?
BL: I do a lot of research.
EE: Got it. Do you ever play games?
BL: I hardly play games.
EE: Understood. I often read manga on my smartphone.
BL: Do you use any specific manga apps?
EE: Yes, I do.
BL: Manga often comes through advertisements, right?
EE: Yes, I keep adding more apps from interesting ads.
BL: Is your smartphone's storage capacity sufficient?
EE: I use an Android, so I can increase storage with an SD card.
BL: Can apps also be stored on the SD card?
EE: I mainly store photo data.
BL: I store photos too.
EE: Are you using an Android?
BL: I have both an Android and an iPhone.
EE: Same here!
BL: How do you differentiate between them?
EE: I mainly use Android and only use the iPhone when needed.
BL: Understood.
EE: How do you differentiate your usage?
BL: I use it for calling and communication.
EE: Got it! I also use my iPhone mainly for calls.
BL: I use an Android for calls.
EE: Understood.
BL: It is convenient to use them differently, isn't it?"
2,"EE: Hello
BL: Hello.
EE: What is your favorite household chore?
BL: Hanging out the laundry.
EE: It's fun, isn't it?
BL: It feels refreshing to hang out things that have become clean.
EE: The laundry hung out after smoothing out the wrinkles looks very good.
BL: If you leave it in the washing machine for a long time, it feels unfortunate.
EE: If you forget about it, it will start to smell like it's only half dry.
BL: The smell is one thing, but it also easily wrinkles.
EE: I make sure to iron clothes just before hanging them up to dry.
BL: It's fully automatic, right? Are you intentionally stopping it?
EE: I set the dehydration to 0 minutes and run it on the course up to rinsing.
BL: I see. Our washing machine doesn't have that function. That's nice.
EE: Items that easily wrinkle are convenient because the dehydration time can be shortened.
BL: When that happens, I press the stop button. I want that feature!
EE: The timing seems difficult.
BL: It's difficult to get the timing right when you're doing other things.
EE: In the future, I want a fully automatic washer-dryer.
BL: Household chores will become easier.
EE: If it automatically dries as well, there wouldn't be the enjoyment of hanging clothes, but it would be very convenient.
BL: You might start wanting other convenient household items.
EE: I also want a Roomba.
BL: I'd also like to have a dishwasher.
EE: It's the modern version of the three sacred treasures.
BL: It will save a lot of time.
EE: The world has become a convenient place.
BL: The only thing left is for the Roomba to move the luggage out of the way as it goes, and it would be perfect.
EE: I'm looking forward to the update.
BL: Looking forward to the update!"
