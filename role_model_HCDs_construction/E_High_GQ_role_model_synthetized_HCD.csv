GQ: It got quite cool after the typhoon passed, didn't it?
EB: Yes, the temperature might drop below 20 degrees at night.
GQ: I didn't prepare my futon. I feel like I'm going to catch a cold.
EB: We are still using a towel blanket.
GQ: I need to wash the blanket because I was fighting over it with my child.
EB: Yes, it's good to start preparing soon.
GQ: I also need to get out my long sleeves.
EB: I have put out a few long-sleeved shirts. It might not be necessary yet.
GQ: Since I only prepared a light jacket, I need to find something to wear underneath.
EB: It can be tough to put away and take out clothes.
GQ: Do you switch out your clothes yourself?
EB: The whole family does it together.
GQ: Great job. I have to do it almost by myself.
EB: That sounds tough. Itâ€™s quite heavy.
GQ: I have a backlog of taking my children's old clothes to the recycle shop and can't get sorted.
EB: Some services come to pick it up for you.
GQ: I don't have those services, so I only bring my own.
EB: It's a service you can use without worry.
GQ: I'll try it next time.
EB: Yes, it can reduce the burden.
GQ: Donating used clothes is also an option.
EB: Yes, facilities appreciate it.
GQ: I might give it a try.
EB: Please try various things. It's more convenient now.
GQ: There are options to pack it in a cardboard box without bearing the shipping cost, right?

2,"GQ: Hello, nice to meet you.
EB: Thank you in advance.
GQ: Do you play video games?
EB: I only play games for work or with my kids.
GQ: Your job is related to games, right? My child is all about the Switch.
EB: My job is not directly related to games, but I translate and localize overseas games.
GQ: That's an interesting job. It might be useful for my child's future.
EB: Before the pandemic, I worked overseas a lot. Now, I do more translations for dramas and movies from home.
GQ: That sounds like a dream job! I really love Western movies.
EB: That's great! You might know a movie I've localized.
GQ: Amazing! But I haven't been to the movie theater recently.
EB: It's hard to get out these days. The theater was pretty empty when I saw Evangelion.
GQ: My high schooler has started watching foreign films with subtitles now.
EB: Subtitles can be very good for some movies.
GQ: Exactly. It's tough to watch with subtitles when the kids are young.
EB: Definitely. We speak different languages at home to create a foreign language environment.
GQ: Impressive! I've struggled since my parents can't speak other languages.
EB: That can be tough. It's important for parents to speak first.
GQ: That's why I want my children to study abroad.
EB: If you're considering studying abroad, I recommend the UK.
GQ: You must speak beautiful English. Did you study in the UK?
EB: I'm self-taught in English. The UK is great because it has advanced independent education.
GQ: Independent education is important.
EB: Yes, gaining knowledge is useless if you can't do things on your own.
GQ: I understand. Do your kids have separate rooms?
EB: The oldest one has a separate room.
GQ: We have a bunk bed, and the youngest still sleeps with me.
EB: It's okay to rely on others, but I try to do things on my own if I can.
GQ: That's a great approach! We haven't managed to do that yet.
EB: It depends on the environment, so it's not always possible."
