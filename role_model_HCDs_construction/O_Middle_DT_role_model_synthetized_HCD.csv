DT: Hmm, I'm not sure. It seems challenging.
CO: Is it difficult?
DT: We can't travel, can we?
CO: Do you like traveling?

2,"DT: Good evening.
CO: Good evening! How can I assist you today?

CO: I have been going to the office more frequently now. Things have settled down a bit.

DT: Yes, stores like Akachan Honpo and similar ones.
CO: Sometimes I shop for my friend's child as well.
DT: Are you getting a gift?
CO: Yes, for when the child was born. However, I am unsure of what to buy.
DT: Any gift would likely be appreciated. A small toy might be a good idea.
CO: I wonder if there are any specific preferences. Is any toy suitable?
DT: Some toys might be preferred based on characters, so something generic like a rattle with animals might be better.
CO: That is helpful advice.
DT: I was happy to receive a toy made of rice from my cousin.
CO: Rice? Is that commonly available?
DT: Yes, it is sold. It’s made from rice, which makes it safe for the baby to put in their mouth.
CO: That is interesting. I will consider that option."
