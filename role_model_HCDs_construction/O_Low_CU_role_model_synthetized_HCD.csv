1,"CU: Thank you in advance!
CA: You're welcome!
CU: Do you have any lunch plans for today?
CA: I'm still undecided. I'm considering my options. Do you have any plans, CU?
CU: My husband and child went fishing today, so they'll probably bring back McDonald's on their way home.
CA: McDonald's sounds nice! Did you request anything specific from their menu?
CU: I usually get the teriyaki burger.
CA: That sounds delicious! Now I feel like having one too.
CU: The Chicken Tatsuta is actually my favorite, though it's a limited-time item.
CA: Chicken Tatsuta! Wasn't that advertised in Touch's commercials?
CU: Yes, it was! Have you ever tried it?
CA: No, I haven't tried it yet. Is it available annually like the Tsukimi Burger?
CU: I think it's available once a year.
CA: I'll definitely try it next time!
CU: It usually comes out around spring. The buns are fluffy and tasty, so give it a try!
CA: The buns are different too? I look forward to spring then!
CU: What kind of fast food do you like, CA?
CA: I like the Twister from KFC, and I occasionally treat myself to one.
CU: I know! It's delicious, isn't it? The naan-like dough is tasty.
CA: Yes! The texture of the dough is unique! I enjoy KFC, but I also love the Twister.
CU: I also like Japanese-style cutlet sandwiches. I guess I have a thing for sweet and savory flavors, haha.
CA: Sweet and savory flavors are great! Do you have any fast food plans for today?
CU: Talking about it makes me want to get some! Should I go to McDonald's or KFC?
CA: That sounds like a good idea. It's Obon, so it's a good time to relax.
CU: I'll consider it as having a meal together with our ancestors.
CA: Our ancestors might appreciate the special food too.
CU: Hehe. That would be nice. Maybe I'll get a Twister too.
CA: The weather seems bad, but stay safe and take care.
CU: Thank you. Let's chat again soon!"
2,"CU: Hello!
CA: Hello!
CU: The weather has been really strange lately, don’t you think?
CA: Yes, despite the rainy season ending, there has been continuous and heavy rainfall.
CU: There have been damages in different places. Was everything alright at your place?
CA: I am fine, thanks. How about you?
CU: I was also fortunate to be okay. But it’s worrying to think about what would happen if flooding occurred here.
CA: It is indeed concerning when watching such events on TV. Do you have any disaster prevention measures in place?
CU: Yes, I have prepared an emergency evacuation bag.
CA: That’s great to hear!
CU: However, I don't check the contents regularly, so I need to improve on that.
CA: Even having it prepared is a significant step. I should consider preparing one as well.
CU: At home, we have flashlights, portable toilets, water, and non-perishable food in a backpack.
CA: A portable toilet is essential if the water supply is disrupted.
CU: Yes, without water, things would get very difficult. It’s quite frightening to imagine.
CA: True. I realized I should prepare better after thinking about it.
CU: Keeping water in the bathtub is also a good idea.
CA: There are various measures to take, and I should start with those basics.
CU: I think I will review our supplies again!
CA: Currently, we only stock canned food. What kind of canned food do you keep?
CU: Canned mackerel is very convenient.
CA: It is nutritious as well.
CU: Yes, and we also have corn and tuna.
CA: It’s great that both fish and vegetables can be preserved in cans.
CU: Absolutely. But ideally, we won’t need to use our emergency supplies!
CA: If you are prepared, you feel more secure.
CU: That’s right. It seems like abnormal weather will continue.
CA: Praying for safety and taking preventive measures is key.
CU: Yes, let’s both stay prepared.
CA: Talk to you later!"
