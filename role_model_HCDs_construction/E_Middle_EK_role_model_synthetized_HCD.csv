CN: Good evening.
EK: It's hot again today, isn't it?
CN: It's hot, isn't it? Are you doing anything to cope with the heat?
EK: I keep the air conditioning on all day.
CN: Same here. Are you drinking plenty of fluids?
EK: Yes, I stay hydrated and use oral rehydration solutions.
CN: If you get heatstroke, oral rehydration solutions are important. Do you have them on hand?
EK: I always have them with me, especially when I go out.
CN: That’s a good practice! I often bring sports drinks.
EK: It's essential during this season. Do you spend a lot of time outdoors?
CN: I mostly stay indoors. How about you?
EK: Half and half. I jog even if it's hot.
CN: How far do you run?
EK: Usually about 5 kilometers. Sometimes 10 on a good day. Do you exercise?
CN: I go for walks in the evening when it's cooler.
EK: Sounds good. I'm also interested in trekking.
CN: For trekking, you might need some equipment. Do you have any?
EK: I recently bought shoes. They seem to be in fashion.
CN: Outdoor activities are becoming popular. Do you go camping?
EK: I recently resumed camping.
CN: Which campsite did you go to recently?
EK: We went to Karuizawa. It was hot and didn't feel like a summer resort at all.
CN: It's hot even in Karuizawa! The recent heatwave is incredible.
EK: It's worrisome to think about what things will be like in 10 years.
CN: Summer is almost like the tropics. What did you make for camp meals?
EK: I cooked rice. It tasted surprisingly good.
CN: Food tastes better outside, even convenience store bread.
EK: True. With a little creativity, you can enjoy anything.
CN: It's true!"
2,"EK: Good evening!
CN: Good evening.
EK: I've been staying up late recently.
CN: Are you working?
EK: No, just watching movies and stuff.
CN: What movie did you watch recently?
EK: The most recent movie I watched was Jurassic World. Do you know it?
CN: Yes, I know of it.
EK: That's it!
CN: It's interesting, but I've heard it's challenging to follow without seeing the previous movies.
EK: It was interesting! You should watch it.
CN: Can it be enjoyed without seeing the previous ones?
EK: Yes, it’s exciting enough on its own.
CN: Sounds good! Do you like action movies?
EK: Yes, I do. They're easy to watch without much thinking. Do you often watch movies?
CN: Not often, but recently I watched a Dragon Ball movie.
EK: Ah, nostalgic! I love it.
CN: It's easy to enjoy without thinking too much, right?
EK: Right. I also like Evangelion when it comes to anime.
CN: Evangelion is interesting. It makes you think a bit, doesn't it?
EK: Yes, no matter how much I think, I can't understand it.
CN: It's complicated, isn't it?
EK: Yes. Watching movies at home is nice, but I realized that the movie theater experience is different.
CN: The big screen and sound quality are impressive.
EK: I was surprised at how much it has evolved!
CN: Watching at home is nice, but the cinema experience is different.
EK: It's unfortunate that movie theaters are decreasing in rural areas.
CN: Is it difficult to attract customers?
EK: I think so. I'm going to support the movie theater!
CN: That's nice!"
