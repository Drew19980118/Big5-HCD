DG: Hello!
EQ: Did you go back to your hometown this summer?
DG: I went back to my parents' house, so I've been relaxing the whole time.
EQ: That sounds relaxing!
DG: Did you go back to your hometown?
EQ: Yes, I visited Yamanashi. It was hot there.
DG: Yamanashi is nice! I used to go there often to eat hoto (a type of noodle dish).
EQ: Yes, it's quite hot in the summer, but there are lots of delicious fruits.
DG: It's a very charming prefecture, especially for food lovers!
EQ: I agree. I usually get grapes and peaches sent to me, so I never have to buy them myself.
DG: That's nice, peaches are great. Recently, I've seen Yamanashi grape wine.
EQ: I prefer California wine mostly.
DG: I don't know much about wine, but I'm impressed by the quality of Japanese wines.
EQ: That makes me happy as someone from Yamanashi!
DG: Do you often drink wine?
EQ: My husband likes it, so I get more opportunities to drink.
DG: Is your husband knowledgeable about it?
EQ: Yes, he enjoys it. There are many heavy drinkers around us.
DG: Ahaha, I like drinking wine too, but we don't know much about it, so I'm a bit envious.
EQ: It's convenient to have someone choose for me. I usually find something affordable to drink.
DG: I also look for affordable options when drinking alone. It's hard to quit alcohol.
EQ: So you enjoy alcohol too?
DG: Yes, I like it. Yesterday, I had some grape liqueur.
EQ: I prefer sweet and low-alcohol drinks.
DG: Do you drink chuhai?
EQ: Only when I go to an izakaya.
DG: I see. I drink green tea highballs at home. It seems like an old man's habit.
EQ: I've never had a green tea highball. I want to try it.
DG: I feel a little guilty about it sometimes!"
2,"EQ: Hello. How are you doing?
DG: Hello. I'm in a good mood listening to music.
EQ: What kind of music is it?
DG: I've been into a band called Maneskin lately.
EQ: What genre is their music?
DG: It's rock music. I discovered it at a festival recently.
EQ: Did you go to a rock festival?
DG: Yes, it was my first time in several years. It was challenging due to the heat.
EQ: Where was the festival held?
DG: It was at Makuhari.
EQ: I imagine it attracted a large crowd.
DG: Yes, there were more people than I anticipated.
EQ: Is it an all-day event?
DG: It starts around 10 AM and continues until the evening.
EQ: That's quite long. Can attendees come and go?
DG: Yes, it's common to secure a spot and rest within the venue.
EQ: So, it's held outdoors?
DG: Makuhari Messe was indoors and the stadium events were outdoors.
EQ: Are performances indoors while the audience is outdoors?
DG: There were about six stages; the stadium was the largest one.
EQ: Do performances happen simultaneously on multiple stages?
DG: Yes, there were around three indoor stages and three outdoor stages.
EQ: That's impressive. Can you hear each stage from the others?
DG: The sound was managed well, but moving between stages was tiring.
EQ: It must be a spacious venue.
DG: Yes, I used buses to get around. It was exhausting with so many people.
EQ: Using buses seems complicated. Was it easy to get separated from your group?
DG: A smartphone was essential. The unfamiliar festival was indeed tiring.
EQ: But it sounds like a great experience. I'm envious as I've never attended one.
DG: Thank you for listening and chatting.
EQ: Thank you for sharing."
