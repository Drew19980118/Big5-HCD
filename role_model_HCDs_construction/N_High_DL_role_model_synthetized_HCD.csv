1,"DL: Good evening. Nice to meet you.
DY: Good evening, nice to meet you.
DL: Do you read manga or anything like that?
DY: Yes, I often read manga.
DL: Do you have any favorite works?
DY: Recently, I found a jazz manga called 'Blue Giant' interesting.
DL: I've heard of it. Is it a currently ongoing series?
DY: Yes, it is being serialized. I only read the compiled volumes, so I'm not sure about the magazine it's in.
DL: It seems like a Big Comic. It has a movie adaptation too. I'm curious about it.
DY: It’s really interesting. Even though it’s a manga, it feels like you can hear the sounds.
DL: I'll look it up and read it later! It's nice that we can easily read the first episode if interested.
DY: Yes, it’s convenient. Do you have any manga recommendations?
DL: I like 'March Comes in Like a Lion,' 'Raika Days,' and 'Hatarakanai Futari.' They might be considered minor.
DY: I used to read 'Hatarakanai Futari' a long time ago! It's the one about the NEET siblings, right?
DL: That's right! It’s updated weekly, and I look forward to reading it every week.
DY: It's nice and peaceful, isn’t it? I’ve also read some of 'March Comes in Like a Lion.' It’s about shogi, right?
DL: Yes, it is. I'm glad to find someone with similar interests. Do you have more recommendations?
DY: We might have similar tastes. Do you know 'Blue Period'? It's one of my favorites.
DL: Is it serialized in the afternoon?
DY: Yes, it's the art manga one.
DL: You like intense plots in manga, don’t you?
DY: Yes, I do. But I don’t read manga as much as I used to.
DL: Have you become busy with work or found a new hobby?
DY: I spend a lot of time watching YouTube.
DL: That can be a time thief. What kind of videos do you watch?
DY: Yes, it is. I often watch game playthroughs.
DL: I see. Interesting people are really captivating. Each video is so long, before you know it, it's late.
DY: Yes, and before you know it, it’s time to sleep. Do you watch YouTube?
DL: I listen to it while doing housework, like a radio. It helps clear my mind.
DY: Indeed, sometimes I just listen without watching."
2,"DL: Good evening. How can I assist you today?
DY: Good evening. Thank you in advance. 
DL: Are you currently experiencing any difficulties? 
DY: Yes, my job feels very monotonous these days. 
DL: Is your job monotonous? Are you doing clerical work instead of a specialized role? 
DY: I'm a system engineer, which is a specialized job, but it no longer feels fulfilling. 
DL: I see. I thought creating systems would be quite exciting. Is that not the case? 
DY: The working hours were very long, often until midnight, but it's better now since I'm in a different department. 
DL: That sounds exhausting! Was working late at night normal for you? 
DY: Yes, catching the last train daily was normal. However, it's improved now. 
DL: Did you receive proper overtime pay for those hours? It must have added up significantly. 
DY: Yes, the company paid overtime. However, I felt it wasn't necessary to work that much. 
DL: Absolutely, health is important. Do you leave work on time more often now? 
DY: Yes, I usually work 1 to 2 hours of overtime daily. Working from home has made it easier. 
DL: That's good to hear. But earlier, you mentioned it was boring. Does that mean the job is too easy? 
DY: It's due to a lack of fulfillment. I used to build systems, but now I manage people. 
DL: Managing people doesn't interest you as much as creating systems, correct? 
DY: Possibly. Creating systems involves long hours, busyness, and tension. It's a tough balance. 
DL: Both roles have their challenges. Have you considered changing jobs? 
DY: Since I have a family, I decided not to take any risks. The financial aspect is stable, so I thought it best to stay. 
DL: That makes sense. Having a family can limit your freedom sometimes. 
DY: Yes, but having a family provides a calm environment, which is beneficial. 
DL: That's reassuring to hear. How did you meet your wife? 
DY: We met through a matching app. It's not very common. 
DL: Interesting! Do your hobbies and interests align? 
DY: We didn't have many shared hobbies, but our values matched well. 
DL: That's important. Different values can create challenges in a relationship. 
DY: Indeed, it's enjoyable to be with someone you can be yourself around. 
DL: Your happiness is evident. Wishing you ongoing happiness! 
DY: Thank you very much!"
