1,"GA: Good evening. CB: Good evening. GA: Have you already eaten dinner? CB: Yes, I ate! It was something simple like fried rice though. GA: ""Fried rice looks good! Did you make it from scratch?"" CB: There was quite a lot of leftover rice, so I used it to make this. GA: I see. We had vegetables, fish cooked in miso, and avocado. CB: How was the avocado eaten? GA: Dip it in soy sauce and eat it! Delicious! CB: ""It's delicious, isn't it! Isn't it difficult to choose when buying? The degree of damage."" GA: I live with my parents, and my mother cooks for us, but this dish comes up quite often on the menu. It happens so frequently that I didn't realize it. CB: I see. It's nutritious too! It's a well-balanced menu. GA: Maybe they're not considering balance. And they're not very conscious of it. But it's super delicious every day. CB: ""That’s great! Your mother is a good cook, isn’t she? Do you have a favorite dish?"" GA: I've never heard of it... I don't really seem to like cooking that much. There are days when I just get prepared dishes from the supermarket. But just having meals prepared for me is enough. CB: Yes, that's right. I have trouble with the menu because if I don't make it myself, no one else will. GA: I think that if I were to live alone, I definitely wouldn't cook for myself, and since I'm lazy, I'd probably skip meals without a second thought. CB: When you're alone, there are times like that, aren't there? My kids are at home now because their classes have been closed. GA: If you have children, it seems like it would be tough... When I was a child, my mother often asked me what I wanted on the menu. CB: Our family generally asks, but my brother and sister often choose different menus. GA: But you are allowed to give your opinion, right? I always said anything was fine or ordered curry rice, so it seemed troublesome to my parents. CB: I might have been like that too. GA: ""That's right. There are so many things that I don't know what to say."" CB: ""It's amazing that so many menu ideas come to mind. Do you eat at home for all three meals?"" GA: Mostly just dinner. CB: Are you at work or school during the day? GA: It's work. CB: Was work today? GA: ""Yes, I'm tired."" CB: Good work! I was working too, so now I'm taking a break."
2,"GA: Please! CB: Thank you in advance. GA: What kind of music do you usually listen to? CB: Yorushika, Humbert Humbert, Yoasobi, and various others. GA: ""I've only just heard of Humbert Humbert! Are they a recent artist?"" CB: ""Not recently. It's often played in commercial songs too!"" GA: Is it the pattern that I am listening to it unconsciously! Can you tell me the title? CB: ""Misawa Home or something?"" GA: ""That's true! I just looked it up and I've heard of it before."" CB: Is that so? I'm happy. GA: I used to listen to Yorushika and YOASOBI a lot. Maybe not so much recently. CB: ""I'm not always listening to music, but I listen to female vocalists the most. What do you listen to?"" GA: Recently, I've been listening to nothing but songs from the unit called DIALOGUE+. CB: I heard it for the first time! GA: ""It seems to be an idol group of new voice actors. Their recognition might still be low."" CB: I just searched on Amazon Music. GA: The song itself is really good because it's produced by Tabuchi-san from UNISON SQUARE GARDEN. CB: I see. I'm listening to it now, and it has a nice pop feel to it. GA: Basically, it's pop. Sometimes it changes to a cooler vibe or the atmosphere changes dramatically. CB: I see. Do you also go to concerts and such? GA: I went there for the first time the day before yesterday! CB: Oh, that's hot. How was it? GA: The seats were close, so I felt a great sense of satisfaction. They were cute and cool, and the lingering effect is still strong. CB: Sounds good. It's exciting to go in person. GA: I like live band performances, and since it was a venue with a capacity of 1000 people, the impact was incredible! CB: So it was a box that could hold that much! GA: ""The venue didn't seem like a live house, did it? Even so, since they are still new, I think it was still relatively small."" CB: ""Even though you're new, it's impressive that you can gather so many people. You're popular, aren't you?"" GA: I think it’s only been about 2 or 3 years since their debut, but I feel like they’re putting a lot of effort into it. CB: Thank you for teaching me because I don't know much about idols!"
3,"GA: Please! CB: Please! GA: Do you usually play games? CB: I don't do it at all. Both of my kids are always playing Minecraft. GA: ""Is it only Minecraft? In that case, we can't play together..."" CB: The older child is playing on the PC, and the younger child is playing on the iPad in a cooperative game. I'm just watching them. GA: Eh, wow. Is your child around elementary school age? CB: ""The older one is in the sixth grade and the younger one is in the first grade."" GA: ""It's amazing how you can use the iPad so well... Do all small kids have one these days?"" CB: It wasn't meant to be exclusively for the child, but my iPad has become the child's device. GA: I see, I see. So you can play Minecraft on an iPad. CB: That's right. The older child got interested after being taught and has been hooked ever since. The younger child's favorite celebrity is also someone from Minecraft's Colorful Peach. GA: ""Is it because of your older brother's influence? Oh no, I don't know that person... This is the first time I've heard of them."" CB: ""It seems to be quite popular, and since there are also merchandise available, I was made to buy it."" GA: I laughed. It's that popular... CB: It seems that my first grader daughter loves it so much that she sleeps while hugging the keychain. GA: I looked it up, but it was different from what I expected and I was surprised. I thought it was someone who shows their face. CB: There are about 13 members, but only 2 of them show their faces. GA: ""Oh, so there are some, huh? Is it now normal to get hooked from the first grade?"" CB: After doing some research, it seems that most of the children are around fourth or fifth grade, so I thought first grade was early. GA: I think even starting in the fourth grade is quite early enough. I didn't really use the internet much myself. CB: I think the volume zone is around 4th grade to university students. I am surprised to see children get so enthusiastic about 2D. GA: Certainly, you can catch a glimpse of unexpected sides of your own children. CB: ""He seems to be maturing quickly, especially since the older one is a boy. It feels like the younger child is being precocious."" GA: ""There’s a group called Sutapora, and my friend is a member, so please check them out! You might get hooked!"" CB: I will try to tell the child! GA: I sing in the 2D world and also do game commentary! CB: I'm watching it now. It's popular, isn't it? The number of channel subscribers is amazing. GA: I haven't been able to support them that much, but it seems like they're on a roll. CB: He says he might like Kotaro. Thank you!"
4,"GA: Hello. Nice to meet you. EO: Hello! Nice to meet you! GA: Did you have breakfast today? EO: Actually, I'm eating right now. GA: Actually, I'm eating too! EO: ""What a coincidence. What is it?"" GA: I am eating rice with raw egg. EO: Sounds good. A simple and nutritious menu. GA: I made a few modifications by adding olive oil, wasabi, and instead of soy sauce, I use noodle soup base. It's highly recommended. EO: ""Olive oil and wasabi! This is the first time I've heard of it."" GA: Probably, I'm the only one doing it around here. Because of my dull sense of taste, I put both in... EO: ""It's quite strong in character... I might try it next time..."" GA: Olive oil alone is delicious enough! What are you eating over there? EO: Toast, boiled egg, grapes, and pumpkin salad. GA: ""Isn't it super stylish...?"" EO: Please don't make me laugh. It makes me feel embarrassed. GA: I'm serious! Is the salad from last night's dinner leftovers? EO: That's right, that's right. GA: ""As expected, right? It seems like a lot of work to prepare."" EO: I can't make something like that in the morning. GA: I don't usually cook, so I think it's really tough. EO: Don't you do it at all? GA: Since I live with my parents, my mother makes it for me. EO: I'm envious. GA: I am always filled with gratitude... EO: Please take care of your mother. GA: That's right. I need to cook once in a while. EO: Being able to cook is not a disadvantage, probably. GA: I'll practice! EO: Please do your best!"
5,"GA: Good morning. EO: Good morning! GA: May I ask about your hobbies? EO: It is reading. GA: ""You're intelligent and cool! What kind of books do you read?"" EO: I read anything. I mostly read novels and books about parenting. GA: I see... Since I don't even read manga, I sometimes wonder if I should read something. EO: Even manga. No, everyone has their own preferences. GA: If it's something like anime, I can still watch it, but I might not be very good at staring at text and reading it. EO: I see. What kind of anime do you watch? GA: If it's something major, I recently finished watching all the BLEACH anime. EO: ""Bleach! Another nostalgic thing."" GA: It certainly is something from quite a long time ago. EO: I used to collect the paperback editions. GA: It really is a generational thing, isn't it? EO: ""That's right. The part where they go to rescue Rukia is the best."" GA: I have only watched up to the anime, so I haven't covered the ending yet, but the Arrancar arc is intense and great! EO: That's a nice place too! The enemies are also cool, right? GA: During the time I was watching it, I kept saying things that sounded like lines from BLEACH to my friends. EO: Huh, now I'm curious about the opposite... GA: No, it's just like imitating or talking in a similar way, something like that. EO: Bankai! Or something? GA: It's exactly like that when I'm playing games. EO: It's like my 7-year-old and 5-year-old sons. GA: I still really can't shake off my childishness, and I think I'm like a child myself. EO: ""Isn't it nice? Staying young at heart forever."" GA: My friends also always say that to me. I'm grateful for it. EO: It's officially approved by your friends too. GA: Everyone tells me that. I'll take good care of it! EO: Let's do that!"
6,"GA: Thank you in advance! EO: Nice to meet you! I listened to your song! GA: Thank you so much, seriously... EO: ""It felt really good! Is this Kansai dialect?"" GA: ""Yes, that's right. Since I'm from Kansai, I created it with Yashiki Takajin in mind."" EO: I see, I'm from Kansai as well. I feel even more familiar with you. GA: Oh, I see! I'm really glad you could listen to it! EO: That you made this by yourself is truly admirable. Will you become a composer in the future? GA: I think it would be nice if I could get used to it. EO: I definitely want it to happen. Do you work every day? GA: There is a lot of inconsistency depending on the day, and most days I don't feel motivated to do anything, so lately I haven't been able to get anything done. EO: Is that so? Have you already informed your parents about the composition? GA: My parents don't know about the music, do they? EO: ""That's a secret, isn't it?"" GA: I hardly talk about myself to my parents. EO: Is that so! As a parent of a son, that information is a bit distressing for me... GA: When I was little, I probably talked about anything and everything. But after I became a junior high school student, I could no longer talk about my worries and concerns. EO: ""Wow, that's lonely. As a parent, I want to know everything. Is it the same for your father?"" GA: As a mother, I can respond to a certain extent, but I can't say anything to my father until I'm pressed. EO: Your father seems stricter. GA: Lately, I feel like I've mellowed out quite a bit with age. EO: I understand. Parents tend to mellow as they get older, don't they? GA: I understand that it's natural for parents to be strict. Or rather, it feels like I'm just being cowardly on my own. EO: Is he scary-looking too? My father is also the strict type. GA: I wonder... If anything, it might be more on the scary side. EO: I see. At our house, if we didn't sit properly during meals, we would get hit from behind. GA: Scary!! I remember my dad throwing a cabbage at me a long time ago. EO: Why cabbage... GA: Maybe it's because it was nearby... EO: Too funny..."
7,"GA: Please! EO: Nice to meet you! GA: Please tell me about your family memories! EO: That's a difficult question... GA: Sorry. I just couldn't help but ask. EO: You mean your current household, not your birth family. GA: Yes, that's right! Or rather, it's difficult to explain concisely... I'm sorry. EO: It's quite difficult! GA: ""It ended up being a very rash decision. Do your children take any lessons or do any extracurricular activities?"" EO: I'm sorry for my lack of responsiveness. I was just at the art class and now I'm going to mini-basketball practice. GA: Oh, that’s really versatile! Mini-basketball is basketball, right? EO: That's right, that's right. GA: Does that mean you have good motor skills? EO: That's not it at all. GA: It's surprising. They seem to be having a hard time. EO: No, I started it by my own choice, so I'm enjoying it. GA: If they are enjoying it, they will likely become very athletic in the future. Is this a different child from the one attending the painting class? EO: ""The eldest and the second son are going to art class. Mini basketball is only for the eldest son who is in elementary school."" GA: I see. I think it's impressive because I used to throw tantrums and couldn't continue with lessons. EO: Did you learn something? GA: ""I went to abacus classes, English conversation classes, and cram school. Only the English conversation class continued even though I was messing around."" EO: Then, are you good at English? GA: I'm only somewhat good at pronunciation, but everything else is disastrous. EO: I also disliked studying. GA: I also used to attend English conversation classes because I liked a childhood friend who took the classes with me. I don't like studying. EO: That's an impure motive. GA: It couldn't be helped because it was cute. EO: It can't be helped. GA: ""I wish I could have become able to speak English!"" EO: ""Didn't it happen?"""
8,"GA: Please! EO: Thank you in advance! GA: What kind of music do you usually listen to? EO: Recently, there have been many anime theme songs. GA: ""That's nice! Is it an anime from some years ago?"" EO: No, no. It's mixed nuts and maybe Habit? GA: ""That's really recent! I haven't been keeping up with that area much."" EO: My child is watching Spy x Family. Recently, I've been rewatching Naruto too. GA: It looks like it will take a lot of time to rewatch NARUTO... EO: Orochimaru and the Third Hokage are fighting right now. GA: ""It's still the beginning."" EO: ""I could only watch it a little bit."" GA: I think that's true. Even if you exclude the anime original episodes, it would probably take about 2-3 years. EO: ""Huh, will it really take that long?!"" GA: I don't know, but since it was broadcast for a total of 15 years, I guess it would be around that much. EO: ""It was broadcast for 15 years! I'm surprised."" GA: Well, taking it slow and enjoying it isn't so bad, right? EO: Sure, I will. Since when have you been a shut-in? If you don't mind me asking. GA: It was around the time when the state of emergency was first declared due to the COVID-19 pandemic. EO: Isn't it surprisingly recent? GA: Since junior high school, I've developed a habit of slacking off, I dropped out of high school due to insufficient attendance, couldn't hold down a part-time job for a year, and that's where I am now. EO: It's no good. GA: Really. EO: ""I used to be late often too."" GA: ""If I were going to be late, I thought it would be better not to go. I was really foolish."" EO: Oh, I was late, but I did go. I would arrive at school during lunch break and such. GA: That's right, we definitely should have done that. But if you're late more than five times a month, you had to write a reflection paper or some other punishment, and that was a hassle too. EO: I understand! They make us write meaningless reflection papers! GA: I'm not sure if it's fair to blame that system, but things might have been different if it didn't exist. EO: Indeed."
9,"GA: Please! EO: Nice to meet you. GA: What kind of part-time jobs have you done so far? EO: ""Izakaya, convenience store, family restaurant, home tutor, cram school teacher, cabaret club, apparel."" GA: ""They're all customer service jobs, aren't they? It must be tough if you're shy."" EO: Oh, that's true. But when it comes to work, you can do it, right? GA: But I kind of understand that feeling. It's like you can talk more easily because they're a complete stranger, right? EO: That's right. Customers are different. GA: That's right. When I worked part-time at a call center, I felt like my vocabulary improved and I could speak more clearly. EO: I also wanted to try working at a call center! GA: I remember being surprised at how unexpectedly easy it was when I tried working at a call center. It took a while to get used to the manual though. EO: Oh, really? It seemed difficult. GA: ""I think it depends on the place, but the call center I worked at was to support the staff, not the customers, so there weren't many complaints."" EO: I see... There are various types of call centers, aren't there? GA: ""I felt like I had something like that too."" EO: What other part-time jobs have you done? GA: Warehouse work, stocking shelves at a supermarket, also at a bread factory, game bug testing (I quit both of those in one day), I guess. EO: It's basically a behind-the-scenes feeling. GA: As far as I remember, I think it was mostly back-office work. So at first, before going to the call center, I had quite a bit of resistance. EO: I see, it's a job where you talk to people, after all. GA: I had never worked in customer service before, so I was extremely nervous, but I got used to it in less than a month. EO: ""Did it last relatively long?"" GA: The call center job was the most recent and the one that lasted the longest. I was often praised at work, and I got along well with the employees too. EO: Why did you quit? GA: The reason for quitting almost every part-time job is ""I lost to myself."" EO: What is that? GA: I'm sorry. I might just not be a morning person, but often my body wouldn't move before going to work. EO: ""Maybe I was unknowingly accumulating stress?"" GA: I don't think I'm stressed, but even though things should be going well, I suddenly stop. EO: It's mysterious, isn't it?"
10,"GA: Please! EO: Thank you in advance! GA: ""Does the fact that you were doing tutoring and working at a cram school mean that you were smart?"" EO: I'm only good at Japanese. GA: Is it possible to have a part-time teaching job as a teacher specializing in Japanese language? EO: I see. It was fine just teaching Japanese! GA: Wow! I'm surprised because I had the impression that you had to be good at all subjects. EO: ""No, rather, at cram schools, the time for Japanese and the time for math were also fixed."" GA: It's true that there might have been such teachers at cram school. There were also people who only handled math. EO: Right! Because the tutor is for elementary school students, they might have taught subjects other than Japanese language arts. GA: Huh, if you can exercise with that too, wouldn't it be perfect? EO: You cannot exercise, can you? Unfortunately... GA: Since everyone has some shortcomings... I also wanted to try being a teacher. EO: ""Can't you be an English teacher?"" GA: No way... I was just feeling embarrassed about saying I could speak English... EO: What was your deviation score? GA: The high school I entered should have been ranked around 47 at that time. EO: 47, huh? GA: ""It's kind of a silly high school. There weren't really any delinquent people though."" EO: My high school was around 55. For myself, I got about 65 in Japanese! GA: Around 60 seems to be the most enjoyable time, doesn't it? To be 65, you must really be outstanding! EO: But since I couldn't get to 70, that's as far as I can go. GA: When people go up to around 70, they start lacking in various ways, so it's best to be neither too smart nor too foolish! EO: ""That's true! My older brother is a researcher and he's smart, but he's crazy."" GA: ""More surprising news again..."" EO: ""I'm researching cancer at **, but I have serious personality issues."" GA: Wow... It seems like a lot of smart people find it hard to communicate. It might not be a problem if it's between intelligent people though. EO: I wonder if compatibility is a factor. GA: I've heard that if the IQ gap becomes too wide, communication becomes difficult. EO: I see."
