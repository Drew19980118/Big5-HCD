1,"EK: Good evening! CN: Good evening. EK: It's hot again today, isn't it? CN: ""It's hot, isn't it? Are you doing anything to cope with the heat?"" EK: Basically, the air conditioning is left on 24 hours a day. CN: ""Same here. Are you drinking plenty of fluids?"" EK: I am quite careful about staying hydrated, including using oral rehydration solutions. CN: If you get heatstroke, oral rehydration solutions are important, right? Do you keep them on hand? EK: ""I always keep it on hand. I make sure to bring it whenever I go out!"" CN: Sounds good! I often bring sports drinks. EK: It's essential during this season, isn't it? Do you spend a lot of time outdoors? CN: Basically, I stay indoors a lot. How about you? EK: I'm half and half! I like exercise, so I go jogging even if it's hot. CN: Amazing! How far do you run? EK: It's not that much. I usually just jog about 5 kilometers. On a good day, I can manage around 10 kilometers. Do you exercise? CN: I only go for walks. I do it after it gets cool in the evening. EK: Sounds good. I haven't done it yet, but I'm also interested in trekking! CN: If it's trekking, it seems like equipment might be necessary. Do you have any? EK: Recently, I only bought shoes. Somehow, they seem to be in fashion, right? CN: ""Outdoor activities are becoming popular, aren't they? Do you go camping?"" EK: ""It's not that I followed the trend, but I recently resumed camping!"" CN: ""That's nice. Which campsite did you go to recently?"" EK: We went to the campsite in Karuizawa! It was too hot and not a summer resort at all. CN: ""It's hot even in Karuizawa! The recent heatwave is incredible.."" EK: It's worrisome to think about what things will be like in 10 years, isn't it? CN: Summer is almost like the tropics, isn't it? What did you make for camp meals? EK: I just cooked and ate rice, but for some reason, it was delicious. CN: Food tastes strangely good when you eat it outside, doesn’t it? Even convenience store bread tastes somehow delicious when eaten outside. EK: That's right. With a little ingenuity, you can enjoy anything. CN: It's true!"
2,"EK: Good evening! CN: Good evening. EK: I've been staying up late recently. CN: Oh, are you working? EK: No, just lounging around. Watching movies and stuff. CN: What movie did you watch recently? EK: The most recent movie I watched was Jurassic World! Do you know it? CN: I know. You are doing it right now, aren't you? EK: That's it! CN: I've heard it's interesting, but since I haven't seen the previous work, it's difficult... EK: It was interesting! I definitely want you to watch it. CN: ""Is it okay even if I haven't seen the previous work?"" EK: It might make more sense if you've seen the previous work, but even if you haven't, it's exciting enough to enjoy on its own! CN: Sounds good! Do you like action movies? EK: I like it! Because I can watch without thinking much. Do you often watch movies? CN: I don't watch much, but recently I watched a Dragon Ball movie. EK: Ah, nostalgic! I love it! CN: ""You can enjoy that without thinking too much about it, right?"" EK: Right. I also like Evangelion when it comes to anime. CN: It's interesting! Eva makes you think a bit, doesn't it! EK: No matter how much I think about it, I can't understand it. CN: ""It's complicated, isn't it?"" EK: That's right. Watching movies at home is nice too, but I realized the other day that it's really different when you watch them in a movie theater. CN: ""The impact of the big screen is impressive, isn't it? The sound quality is great too!"" EK: I was quite surprised at how much it has evolved! CN: Watching at home is nice and relaxing, but the cinema experience is different! EK: It is unfortunate that movie theaters seem to be decreasing in rural areas. CN: That's unfortunate... Is it difficult to attract customers? EK: I thought so. I'm going to support the movie theater! CN: That's nice!"
3,"EK: Good evening! AO: Good evening. EK: What did you do today? AO: Today I worked in the afternoon, and after I came home, I spent my time surfing the internet. EK: Good job with your work. Internet surfing can become endless, right? AO: It sounds great! What do you mainly look at on the internet? EK: I wonder, do you have a lot of research to do? Like for hobbies and such. AO: ""May I ask about your hobbies?"" EK: There are so many things. Bikes, outdoor activities, travel, and so on. AO: You have so many hobbies, I'm envious! It looks like you have a lot of friends with similar interests too. EK: It's not deep enough to be called a hobby. AO: No, no, it's great to have many things to enjoy! Did you start all of them after becoming an adult? EK: Everything is recent. Last year, I suddenly decided to get a large motorcycle license and bought a bike. AO: That's awesome! A large motorcycle, so cool! EK: ""For over 30 years, I had absolutely no interest in it."" AO: Was there some kind of trigger? EK: I don't think there was any particular trigger. It was really just a whim! AO: Wow, you're really quick on your feet! EK: That is my only special skill. Do you have any hobbies? AO: My hobby is having a drink in the evening. Compared to outdoor activities, it's pretty unhealthy, isn't it? EK: Actually, my favorite hobby is having a drink in the evening. AO: Oops, I see! What kind of alcohol do you usually drink? EK: Originally, I used to drink beer, but recently I've taken a liking to whiskey. AO: ""Being an adult... Whiskey seems difficult to enjoy or know how to drink."" EK: That's right. I'm also not very sure, so I don't have the courage to order it at a store yet. AO: Got it! Bars can be a bit nerve-wracking! EK: Really! I'm thinking of gathering my courage and trying to go. AO: For now, it might be an option to go and see, then choose based on the price. EK: If you ask, they will tell you, right? AO: Yes, that's right. Please let me know the results when you decide to give it a try someday! Take care."
4,"EK: Hello! DK: Hello! EK: Nice to meet you! Are you off today? DK: ""Yeah, I was doing laundry and relaxing."" EK: ""A relaxing weekend, isn't it nice! Do you go somewhere on your days off?"" DK: Originally, I was not the type to go out, but with the COVID-19 pandemic, I go out even less. EK: I see. I'm the opposite. DK: Where do you go on your days off? EK: I like to shop lazily. DK: That's nice. I like wandering around consumer electronics stores and home centers. I go on weekdays rather than weekends. EK: I also like electronics retail stores, and even though I don't have any particular purpose, I end up wandering around. DK: Finding new and unusual things is fun, isn't it? But I don't make impulse purchases. Haha. EK: ""Have you recently purchased any electronic appliances?"" DK: Last year, I bought an LED to replace the round fluorescent light. EK: Ah, I understand! It's quite bright, isn't it? We recently changed ours too! DK: No special construction needed, it's remote-controlled, and I'm delighted that the power consumption is halved. EK: ""Really, it's a convenient world, isn't it! Although it's quite a task to choose products."" DK: I think it's also important to check electronics retail stores. EK: ""Even smartphone charging cables are lined up in dozens of varieties, aren't they?"" DK: There are many, right? There are so many types even at the 100 yen shop, it's overwhelming. EK: I recently visited a 100 yen shop for the first time in years, and I was surprised to see how much it had evolved! DK: Is that so? Recently, products priced at 200 yen or 300 yen have been increasing. EK: That's right. It used to feel like everything was worth less than its price, but now it's completely the opposite. DK: Information is spreading online, and cost-effective products are becoming popular, while others are likely to disappear. EK: ""Certainly, that might be significant!"" DK: Articles and videos on how to creatively use 100-yen shop items are popular, aren't they? EK: When I buy something, I often refer to YouTube. DK: I understand, if I'm interested in a product at the store, I end up searching for reviews. EK: That is important, isn't it? We want to use functional products for a long time. DK: Yes, that's right. I keep buying good products repeatedly. Thank you very much."
5,"EK: Hello! DK: Hello! EK: Nice to meet you! Is there anything you've been into lately? DK: ""Let's see... I've been watching soccer as a hobby for over 10 years now, mainly through streaming."" EK: I see! Do you actually do it yourself as well? DK: I haven't played sports, including during my school days. I'm really more into watching and I like sports other than soccer as well. EK: ""Huh! What kind of things besides soccer, for example?"" DK: Speaking of Winter Olympic sports, I watched curling a lot. EK: You like team-based games! DK: Yes, curling is a sport that is more interesting to watch on TV. EK: ""Is that so? Is it because you can see the video from various angles?"" DK: There's also that, and in curling, the players wear microphones and everything they say is broadcasted. EK: ""There's something like that! That's interesting."" DK: It’s interesting to understand what the players are thinking. Have you been doing any sports recently? EK: ""There are various things, aren't there? Recently, I mostly train at the gym. I've always liked exercising."" DK: I used to go to the gym and do strength training too, but I have already quit. What kind of routine do you follow? EK: At one point, I was aiming for muscle hypertrophy and working hard at it, but I felt like it wasn't right, so now I'm aiming for the opposite. DK: What do you mean by the opposite of that!? EK: ""Would you say it's functional muscle?"" DK: Is it a practical feeling? What kind of training do you do? EK: ""The bench press focuses on the number of reps rather than the weight, and for the wire exercises, I'm doing them at a lighter weight with faster speed!"" DK: Ah, I see! But it seems like quite a hard training. I have no muscles at all. EK: ""Oh, I place a lot of importance on aerobic exercise! I've lost about 10 kilograms from running a lot, so I feel much better!"" DK: 10 kilos! How long did it take you to lose that much weight? EK: It feels like I've lost some unnecessary muscle. It was about half a year! DK: If it's that much, it's fine within a reasonable range - I think it's healthy. EK: I don't want to restrict my diet, you know. I think calories should be burned through exercise! DK: ""It's wonderful, but it's difficult to keep it up."" EK: Yes. The secret to maintaining it is to do it without putting too much burden on yourself and to take it easy! DK: I see! I'd like to follow your example! I'm lacking exercise due to COVID, haha. Thank you very much."
6,"EK: Hello! DQ: Hello! EK: Did you go anywhere this summer? DQ: Hmm, just minor things like my parents' house and the nearby river. EK: ""Is it a river? Do you swim in it?"" DQ: The children were playing! The water was quite cold. EK: Rivers are cold, aren't they? Is this a mountain stream? DQ: Mountain stream... For a moment, I lost the meaning. I'm sorry. It was U-shaped and slow. EK: The water looks clean, it must be a nice place. DQ: I also brought my dog along, and I was drinking. EK: You have a dog! By the way, what breed is it? DQ: I have two shepherds. They are German and Belgian. EK: Isn't it big? DQ: It’s big! 33kg and 23kg. EK: Oh! It's that heavy! DQ: Yes, that's right. Although he looks a bit rough, my dog is still cute. EK: I love dogs too! I don't have one, but I've always wanted to have one someday! DQ: ""If you were to have a pet, do you have any preferences?"" EK: It's a Shiba. DQ: Now, there are cute and small ones like Mameshiba! EK: ""It's cute, isn't it? The fact that I am often away from home is a drawback."" DQ: Hmm, it certainly might be tough for your pet. EK: That's right. It's easy to start keeping a pet. DQ: Certainly. I haven't been able to go out much either... just for shopping. EK: That happens, doesn't it? A large dog, huh. Your home must be lively! DQ: ""It's lively! By the way, there's also one cat."" EK: Oh! It's just like the Mutsugoro Kingdom! That's nice. DQ: The children love animals too, and it's like a little pet therapy. EK: Just being at home makes me happy. DQ: ""It is a bit difficult for middle and high school students, but I leave it to my pet."""
7,"EK: Hello! DQ: Hello! EK: Is there anything you've been into lately? DQ: Hmm, since I have some free time, I feel like spending it on reading. EK: I see. What kind of books do you read? DQ: I often share and read with my children, so there's a lot of light novels, but personally I like things with swordsmen. Right now, I'm reading ""Hakkenden"". EK: ""Your child reads too, right? I also read novels a bit."" DQ: What kind do you like? EK: It's easy to understand, like Keigo Higashino. DQ: Certainly! I really like it too! EK: Once you start reading, you read it all at once, don't you? DQ: That's right! EK: I was originally not good at reading, but when I first saw it, I found it interesting. DQ: ""It's interesting, isn't it! Yesterday, I borrowed the latest volume of the Kaga series from the library."" EK: Oh, that sounds interesting too! Do you have any recommendations? DQ: ""I personally like the guardian of the camphor tree!"" EK: I have never read that! DQ: ""I think it's quite minor, but I want to let the children read it."" EK: The title alone somehow seems interesting. DQ: It's a bit unrealistic, but it also relates slightly to modern issues, so I recommend it! EK: I'll try buying it the next time I go to the bookstore! DQ: Sure, sure! Our place is basically the library, but you have to wait... EK: I like seeing the books I've read increasing on my bookshelf, so I end up buying them impulsively. DQ: Understood! My eldest daughter is like that, but we're running out of space to put things... EK: ""When there are too many, that's what happens. What do you think about e-books?"" DQ: My family liked it and used it, but when I think about what the name was, it's frustrating because I can't quite remember. EK: It's inconvenient not to have physical copies, right? It's convenient, but I still prefer paper. DQ: I am definitely a paper person too! EK: The feeling of turning pages, the smell... I believe all of those are part of the reading experience! DQ: I understand! Kids read on their phones, but it's still about paper, right!"
8,"EK: Hello! DQ: Hello! EK: Do you drink alcohol? DQ: ""I've become weaker recently... I like beer!"" EK: You like beer, don't you! So do I. Don't you feel like the number of people who can't drink has been increasing lately? DQ: Non-alcoholic drinks seem to be popular, don't they? EK: ""Recent ones are quite delicious, aren't they?"" DQ: Is that so? I couldn't really come to like it... EK: ""In terms of juice, I'm also in the group that thinks if I'm just going to drink non-alcoholic, I don't need it, right?"" DQ: That's right! I definitely think lemon-flavored sparkling water is more delicious. EK: That's right. What is your favorite brand of beer? DQ: If possible, Premium Malts or Ebisu. EK: We have exactly the same taste! DQ: If I'm going to have one, I'd like to drink a delicious one. EK: Same here! I like different kinds of beer, but in the end, I always come back to this one. DQ: When it comes to draft beer, the atmosphere and such make almost anything fine. EK: I understand. Recently, the number of places where you can drink craft beer has been increasing. DQ: ""It's increased, hasn't it! Considering the price, there are many times I find myself tilting my head in doubt..."" EK: I agree! It's quite expensive, isn't it? It's a bit of a gamble when you venture into unknown brands. DQ: Really... things like Belgian beer or dark beer are okay... EK: That's right. It's my dream to go to Belgium and try Belgian beer. DQ: Sounds good! I want to drink white beer! EK: It's something like yeast beer! It would probably taste different if we drank it locally. DQ: ""Hey, is it really tasty when you drink it at room temperature?"" EK: I wonder how it is. If possible, I'd like to drink it chilled. DQ: After all, it's nice when they even chill the glass thoroughly. EK: ""I used to live in Germany, and at that time it was a beer paradise."" DQ: Oh! I've been in Germany for 4 weeks, and it was definitely fun! The alcohol too. EK: ""It was a fun city where we drank beer cheerfully without a care!"" DQ: ""I can't wait until tonight! Thank you for the enjoyable conversation!"""
9,"EK: Good evening! BO: Please! EK: Do you have any hobbies or things you've been really into lately? BO: Recently, fishing has become my hobby! EK: ""Fishing? In the sea?"" BO: River fishing! EK: Oh! The kind that uses lures? BO: ""There are lures, and there are also insects!"" EK: ""Do you also do fly fishing?"" BO: That's not true! EK: Even though you call it fishing, it's a bit different in genre, isn't it? BO: I just checked, and it seems difficult. EK: ""Right? Is it something that an amateur can suddenly do?"" BO: I see. Do you have any hobbies? EK: I have recently started to become interested in camping. BO: Camping is fun, isn't it? I like it too. EK: Are you getting married? BO: I used to go quite often in the past! EK: I haven't gone since I was a child. The other day, I bought a tent and am fully prepared. BO: You can go anytime, right? I've heard that Lake Kawaguchi is recommended! EK: Camping by the lake is the ideal form, isn't it? You can also go fishing. BO: Yes! I think I will try going next time. EK: That's great! There are so many good things that it's hard to choose. BO: It seems like solo camping is becoming popular lately. EK: Right. At first, I also think it might be better to be solo without hesitation. BO: I don't feel confident about being able to assemble the tent by myself. EK: Recent tents are incredibly easy to set up! BO: Oh, I see! Hmm, if that's the case, it might be an option! EK: I tried setting it up in the room, and it took less than 5 minutes! BO: Wow! Thank you for the talk."
10,"EK: Good evening! BO: Please! EK: Have you already eaten dinner? BO: Yes! I ate earlier! EK: What's the menu for tonight? BO: It's dumplings! EK: Wow! I haven't had dinner yet. BO: What are you doing today? EK: Upon hearing gyoza, I suddenly have a strong craving for it now. BO: Gyoza is delicious, isn't it? EK: ""This summer, I've been eating a lot. Can you also eat at the restaurant?"" BO: ""I eat at the restaurant too! I also like Osho."" EK: Osho is great, isn't it? I love it and I went there the day before yesterday! BO: Oh! Is that so? I often eat the set of Tenshinhan and gyoza. EK: It's exactly the same! Doesn't Tianjin rice differ completely depending on the restaurant? BO: It's completely different! But I like the Tianjin rice from Osaka Ohsho. EK: ""It's delicious, isn't it? I'm completely in the mood for gyoza now."" BO: Let's have dumplings today! EK: Sadly, I don't have it at home. BO: That's unfortunate... Maybe sometime soon! EK: Yes. What do you think about eating late at night? BO: If I'm really hungry, I'll eat it. If I can endure it, I will! EK: Of course, we do eat. Some people say it's better not to eat after 6 PM, but that's impossible, right? BO: ""It's absolutely impossible. First of all, I usually get home at 8 PM, so it's already too late."" EK: That's right. Depending on the day, it can be even later and perfectly fine. BO: ""Yes. Well, if it's late at night, I try not to binge eat."" EK: That's important! I need to be careful too. BO: Yes! Eat until you are 80% full! EK: Today I'll endure it, and tomorrow I'll go to Osho! BO: Certainly!! Thank you for the conversation."
11,"EK: Good morning! BT: Hello! Good morning. EK: Summer is nearing its end, but did you go anywhere this summer? BT: Well, actually, I haven't done anything at all. I've just been spending my time watching streams. EK: I see! Do you not often go out somewhere? BT: Yes. I'm seriously a shut-in type. I'm the type who can stay home all the time. EK: I see! Are you totally fine even if you don't go out? BT: Of course, I do go shopping. I go out once every few months, to places like museums. EK: ""Is it an art museum? Like paintings?"" BT: That's right. I like paintings and also sculptures. EK: Wow! I was also taken to a museum recently, but I didn't know how to appreciate the art. BT: In the book I read the other day, it recommended carefully observing everything. EK: Is it okay if I interpret it as I like? BT: Also, it's okay to decide based on your likes and dislikes, and I think it's fine to talk with the person you went with about how you don't understand it. EK: ""Is that okay with you? Do you also draw yourself?"" BT: It's not what you would call Western painting, but I do a little bit of design work. EK: Is that so! Then you must be a professional. I’m honored. BT: No! It's really nothing special. It's embarrassing. EK: ""Is everything digital nowadays?"" BT: I work in digital. I'm doing coloring for CG. EK: Hmm! I don't quite understand, but it seems difficult. BT: By the way, what kind of things did you see at the museum you visited the other day? EK: In a state where I don't even know what I saw. I remember Van Gogh and Monet! BT: Oh. Amazing. Was the person you went with a fan of paintings? EK: I love my partner! I also draw pictures myself, so I look at those! BT: Wow. Then it seems like your partner knows much more than I do. EK: No, no, it seems like I'm feeling my way through it. But being able to draw is wonderful. BT: I see. But people who can draw often tend to undervalue themselves because they are surrounded by others who can also draw. EK: Certainly! It seems like it would be hard to know the correct answer. BT: Please, make sure to tell your partner how amazing they are! Hehe."
12,"EK: Hello! BT: Hello EK: When it’s this hot, don’t you crave something cold? BT: That's right. Actually, I'm drinking peach-flavored juice right now. EK: It looks delicious! Do you always have it on hand? BT: No, just by chance. I found it at a convenience store and decided to try it. It's a 1-liter pack. EK: Cold juice is nice too! BT: What kind of drinks do you like? EK: I only drink carbonated water! BT: Oh. Are you drinking only carbonated water? EK: Almost! Sometimes when I feel like drinking juice, I mix orange juice with soda water and drink it! BT: Oh. Is that for health reasons? Or do you just like sparkling water itself? EK: I like carbonated water. As a result, it's also healthy! BT: I see. There are machines you can make at home, right? Or are you buying one? EK: I am currently buying them one by one! I drink about two 1.5-liter bottles a day. BT: Wow! You're drinking a lot. EK: ""There are empty plastic bottles everywhere. When it comes to cold things, it's ice cream, right? Do you eat it often?"" BT: I don't eat ice cream very much. Maybe once or twice a month. EK: I see. I always keep Azuki bars on hand. BT: Oh! Isn't that hard??? EK: Oh, you know about it! That's right! I like it! BT: You love the hard parts too, don't you? Haha. EK: I fell in love with the hardness! BT: It seems I'm completely opposed to you, as I'm on the soft serve ice cream side. EK: Sure, that's right. I'm sorry. BT: Ahaha. Just kidding. It's a joke. EK: It's early in the morning, but I'm starting to feel like eating. BT: Are you someone who can eat ice cream even for breakfast? EK: ""Positioned as a pre-breakfast dessert!"" BT: Azuki bar love is amazing!"
