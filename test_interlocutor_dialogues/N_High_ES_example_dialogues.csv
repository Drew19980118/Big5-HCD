1,"ES: Hello! ER: Hello! Nice to meet you! ES: What did you have for lunch? ER: I had curry for lunch. ES: Curry sounds good! Is it homemade? ER: No, I ate at the restaurant. ES: Is this a curry restaurant? ER: Yes, this is Go! Go! Curry's sausage curry. ES: ""I've been interested in Go! Go! Curry!"" ER: You can choose various toppings and it's delicious! ES: ""Is it like CoCo Ichibanya?"" ER: I see. The roux is fixed, and you can choose items like fried shrimp or cutlets in addition to sausages. ES: ""The ingredients are luxurious! Do you always eat out for lunch?"" ER: It depends on the day. Today I had errands to run, so I ate out. ES: I see. I always eat lunch at home, so I'm envious. ER: ""It's an occasional luxury. What did you have for lunch over there?"" ES: I am egg over rice. It's simple and I laughed at myself. ER: I think tamago kake gohan is good! It's quick and easy to make. ES: ""That's right. Since I'm alone during the day, I'm not too particular. Besides curry, what do you often eat?"" ER: Usually, I have things like kimchi and rice, or ochazuke. ES: When it comes to home-cooked meals, they are similar! ER: I see, I'm usually indifferent since I eat lunch alone as well. ES: When you're alone, you don't make much effort, do you? Frozen udon is also convenient and I often eat it. ER: Frozen udon is also nice, and it seems delicious chilled during hot seasons. ES: ""There are many convenient ways to eat, right? Maybe I should try dining out once in a while too."" ER: I think it's good. I believe it will also be a nice change of pace! ES: For now, I'll try Go! Go! Curry! ER: Absolutely! Since there are various types initially and it can be confusing, it might be a good idea to research online beforehand. ES: I'll check the internet right away! Thank you for letting me know. ER: No, no, thank you!"
2,"ES: Hello, nice to meet you. ER: Hello! Nice to meet you! ES: I am currently looking for a new hobby. Do you have anything you enjoy? ER: I like playing musical instruments. ES: ""Wow, what kind of instrument is it?"" ER: I play the bass. ES: The bass is nice! Do you attend any classes or something? ER: No, I am practicing while watching practice videos on YouTube. ES: Are you self-taught? That's amazing, I didn't know YouTube could be used that way. ER: There are quite a few practice methods and sheet music on YouTube. I also thought it has become convenient. ES: It's more freeing than attending classes, isn't it? Why did you decide to play the bass? ER: I had friends who played the guitar and drums, so it was like, ""Why not...?"" ES: You can form a band! ER: That's right! I started practicing the bass here because I thought we could form a band. ES: ""I admire your band. Do you also double as the vocalist?"" ER: No, we asked another friend to do the vocals. ES: ""Then it's perfect! Playing instruments seems like it can relieve stress too, so it's great."" ER: Since it's a rental, I listen to sound through headphones, but playing sound loudly is a great stress relief. ES: ""It's convenient that you can do it even with headphones. I want to play a wind instrument, but since I live in a rental, I'll have to rent a place."" ER: Wind instruments can have sound leaks, you know. ES: Well, I haven't quite been able to take the step yet. ER: There are studios that become cheaper for individual practice, so it would be nice if there are such places. ES: There's a studio like that! If I practice, please let me join the band. ER: ""Sounds good! Wind instruments really stand out! Which wind instrument do you want to play?"" ES: I am interested in the trumpet. After all, it feels so glamorous. ER: ""Trumpet is nice. Is there any piece you would like to try playing?"" ES: I want to be able to play classic masterpieces. Masterpieces are cool, aren't they? ER: That's right. Even if you play alone, the listeners will still be impressed! ES: Sure, let's talk about music again sometime! ER: Yes! Thank you very much!"
3,"ES: Hello! CD: Hello! ES: What did you eat for lunch? CD: I ate pasta! ES: Pasta sounds good! Did you make it at home? CD: Yes, with tomato sauce. ES: It looks delicious, is the sauce handmade too? CD: I bought the sauce! Also, I added anchovies. ES: ""It's rare to have anchovies at home, isn't it?"" CD: I recently bought some! Do you like anchovies? ES: I hardly remember eating it, but was it fish? CD: Yes, it is. It's a paste made from sardines or something like that. ES: ""Is it something sold at the pasta section?"" CD: Yes. I saw it around there. ES: What does it taste like? It seems like it has a unique flavor. CD: Well, it's a fish. Hahaha. ES: I'm curious. I'll check it out the next time I go to the supermarket! CD: Yes! What did you eat? ES: I ate curry. CD: ""At home?"" ES: Yes. I quickly ate the frozen rice with the instant curry! CD: When it comes to retort curry, the ones from Muji are delicious, aren't they? ES: I like it too! What type do you like? CD: A safe choice would be butter chicken curry. ES: ""It's a classic! Are you okay with spicy food?"" CD: It's okay! ES: I also like spicy food, so I mostly buy green curry. CD: Is it quite spicy? ES: Wheeze. CD: It might be a little difficult for me. Haha."
4,"ES: Hello. CD: Hello. ES: ""Do you usually listen to music?"" CD: ""I listen! I'm listening now."" ES: I see! What kind of music do you like? CD: I was listening to the song ""Just Look Up"" by Ariana Grande. ES: Foreign music is nice! But I've never heard that song before. CD: Do you know the movie called ""Look Up""? ES: ""It's news to me. Is it recent?"" CD: ""Is it this year's movie? It's on Netflix, but it's that song."" ES: The song is new too, I'll listen to it on YouTube later. CD: ""Movies are also recommended! Do you listen to Western music?"" ES: I listen to Western music! I liked Fifth Harmony during their peak. CD: Is it when there are five people? ES: That's right, I can't remember the name, but after that one person left, the momentum was lost. CD: Camilla, right? I liked her too. ES: As expected! Are you knowledgeable about Western music? CD: I only listen to Western music. So when I go to karaoke, it's full of songs I don't know. ES: I see, who is your favorite singer besides Ariana-chan? CD: ""I mostly listen to the classics. Taylor and Justin, for example."" ES: ""It's nice, I used to listen to Justin's old songs often."" CD: I feel like we might be around the same age! ES: I feel that way! I love Beauty and the Beast, which collaborated with Nicki Minaj! CD: That's great! Let's get into the groove! ES: Even now, I can still get really into it, but it's quite an old song, isn't it? CD: Yes. Justin looked really young in the music video. ES: I can't believe I could get so excited talking with someone so knowledgeable! CD: Yes! That time when Justin had bangs. Haha. ES: ""I miss the time when you were so cute."" CD: That's right! Thank you for the conversation!"
5,"ES: Hello. AR: Hello, nice to meet you. Please take care of me. ES: ""Somehow, I feel nervous."" AR: Do you get shy around strangers? ES: Yes, I get very nervous. AR: Me too. I'm fine with first-time interactions, but I get nervous during the actual event. ES: ""It's a bit similar, isn't it! By 'the real thing,' do you mean something like a presentation?"" AR: That's right. I don't have much opportunity to do it now, but when I was a child, I often wrote the character for 'people' (人) three times on my palm. ES: ""That charm brings back memories!"" AR: Everyone does it, right? ES: I don't remember how I found out, but I was doing it! Also, something about thinking the audience is potatoes. AR: ""Oh!! That is also nostalgic. Among the things that change, it's nice when the conversation matches."" ES: I'm happy! I wonder if today's children also do things like 人人人? AR: My children are still 6 and 5 years old, so they don't understand yet, but it would be endearing if they had such gestures when they become elementary school students. ES: You have small children, don't you! I would love for you to teach them. AR: The nostalgic games we can play right now are Alpus Ichiman Shaku and Glico Pineapple Chocolate, right? It's fun because we can play together. ES: Such games are enjoyable in any era, aren't they! Do you play outside? AR: Since they are two men, they mostly want to go outside. So, since the coronavirus started spreading, they've had excess energy to burn. ES: I have a friend who is raising a boy, and she said she's struggling because he has too much energy. AR: When I see my child's female classmates, I'm always surprised at how different they are, calmly drawing pictures or playing house. ES: Certainly, there is indeed a significant difference in the way girls and boys play, isn't there? AR: I'd like to try wearing matching outfits with a girl at least once. Boys can be clingy and cute too, though. ES: Is your child also a spoiled child? AR: I feel that girls are more straightforward. It seems that there are still times when we want to hold them. ES: I see! But after all, being spoiled is cute. AR: I see. It really brings out my maternal instincts. I'm sure men find their daughters adorable in their own way. ES: It’s surprisingly common for mothers and sons, fathers and daughters to get along well, isn’t it? Listening to your story, I thought, “Kids are wonderful.” AR: They are still pure, so it feels like I'm also being cleansed. Please don't grow up! ES: The purity of children is precious, isn't it? AR: It is more precious than anything! See you again!"
6,"ES: Hello. EV: Hello, nice to meet you. ES: What did you eat for lunch today? EV: It was udon. The cold kind. ES: Is it frozen? EV: I see. I cooled it after boiling it. ES: ""Perfect for a hot summer, right? How does it taste? Is it noodle soup base?"" EV: Yes, I had it with mentsuyu. ES: I'm really starting to crave it. Recently, I've been hooked on eating udon in various flavors. EV: There are many people who study noodles, aren't there? I think that's great. ES: Yes, there are many variations, so you don't get bored. EV: If you change up the toppings and seasonings, you won't get bored, right? ES: I see. Besides noodle soup base, what flavors do you like? EV: Egg and green onion. Simple and delicious. ES: Simple is best! EV: Yes, when I get tired of the noodle sauce, I put soy sauce on it and enjoy it. ES: Soy sauce also has a different kind of deliciousness, doesn't it? Recently, I've been adding rice cakes. EV: Udon with mochi? It's like ozoni. ES: Well, it's like the image of a strong mochi. We sometimes make it with a miso flavor. EV: I see, if it has flavor, it might be quite edible. ES: Yes, it is also delicious if you add gochujang or doubanjiang. EV: Sounds good. It seems appetizing. ES: Do you tend to lose your appetite in the summer? EV: Yes, I tend to get exhausted. ES: I feel the same way. I'm being creative with my food and looking for ideas. EV: I see. I think eating spicy food is the best. ES: Surprisingly, in the summer, you start craving spicy foods, don't you? Are you okay with spicy foods? EV: Super spicy is tough, but medium spicy is okay. ES: I also tend to get an upset stomach. EV: Yes, I agree."
7,"ES: Hello! EV: Hello, nice to meet you. ES: What do you usually do during this time? EV: ""Playing games or reading manga, right? On holidays."" ES: ""That's a relaxing way to spend your time! What kind of game is it?"" EV: ""I often play hunting games and RPGs. The hardware is PS4."" ES: ""That sounds interesting! Do you play smartphone games?"" EV: ""I play a little. I play baseball and Dragon Ball games."" ES: There's a game like that on smartphones? I'd like to try the baseball one! EV: I also started it on a recommendation from a friend. It might be a good way to kill time. ES: By the way, what is the name of the game? EV: ""It's a game called Prospi. If you don't like rigid games, I think PowerPro would be better."" ES: Ah! Is it a game where you can use actual athletes as characters? EV: Yes, that's right. They often do it in commercials. ES: I was very curious. Do you originally like baseball? EV: Yes, I watch it from time to time. ES: I've also been really into it lately. Do you have a team you're rooting for? EV: ""I don't have any favorite. I like watching close games on my computer."" ES: Close games are exciting, aren't they? I want to go watch a Nippon-Ham Fighters game. EV: My home is in Hokkaido, so it's a bit far. If it's a visitor, somehow. ES: I see, I would be happy if you could do it nearby. EV: Is there a stadium nearby where I can watch a game? ES: Since it's Tokyo, I can go to the Dome. I want to watch a game at the Dome at least once! EV: I see. It's nice that it's not affected by the climate. ES: I see, have you ever watched it live? EV: About 10 years ago, but yes, it exists. ES: Is it really different from watching it on TV? EV: Sure. The translated sentence is: ""That's right. The cheering squad is there, so the excitement is conveyed."" ES: The sense of presence in the sound seems amazing. EV: Yes, I don't really understand much about types of pitches."
8,"ES: Nice to meet you, please take care of me. EV: Nice to meet you. It is I who should say that; thank you. ES: Have you been on any trips recently? EV: I won't be traveling. Given the current situation. ES: ""It's quite difficult to go, isn't it?"" EV: Yes, I was planning to go back to my parents' home this month, but that plan was canceled. ES: Is it because COVID-19 is spreading again? EV: I see. My mother has contracted COVID. ES: Eh! Is your mother okay? EV: Yes, I think the treatment is already finished. ES: I see. There are people around me who have lingering aftereffects. EV: I see. Since my mother works at a hospital, there's only so much that can be done about it. ES: In this day and age, I admire that you are working at a hospital. EV: Yes, that's right. There was a period when it had calmed down, but it has started to increase again. ES: ""Didn't your family get disappointed when you canceled your trip home?"" EV: No, it can't be helped. Since we can't enter the house. ES: I see, it would be nice if you could visit your hometown again. EV: Yes, I think it would be nice if I could return in the winter. ES: Do you remember what the infection situation was like last winter? EV: I think it was quite popular. I went back to my hometown, but I monitored my health at the hotel. ES: ""There are a lot of things to be considerate about, aren't there?"" EV: Yes, it had calmed down around spring, but it has come back again. ES: The situation remains one where we cannot let our guard down recently. EV: I see. Traveling itself is not bad, but the risk increases if you get too excited at your destination. ES: After all, when you go back to your hometown or travel, you want to go out, don't you? EV: That's right. We're also paying money, so it would be a waste. ES: I understand the feeling of wanting to have fun if you're going to do it anyway. EV: ""We have to endure it for a while. Let's take care of our health."" ES: Let's take care of our health! EV: Yes, thank you very much."
9,"ES: Hello! DN: Hello. Nice to meet you. ES: Have you decided on tonight's dinner? DN: No, I haven't decided yet. Have you already decided? ES: ""I'm undecided right now. I bought pork yesterday."" DN: I see. Is the pork belly meat? ES: It's thinly sliced peach meat. DN: Is it quite difficult to plan the menu? ES: I get confused every day. How do you decide? DN: I often eat the things I buy at the late evening sales just as they are. ES: I see, I often go in the morning, but is it cheaper in the evening? DN: Yes. Especially fish and sashimi are often less than half price. ES: That's amazing! Is it something like buying it and cooking it right away? DN: It's more about just arranging things rather than cooking. ES: For example, if it's meat, do you mean grilling it? DN: Yes. I just buy sauce that I can cook with vegetables and make a simple dish. ES: That sounds convenient and delicious! Is it sold in the seasoning section? DN: ""They have it in retort pouches in the curry and Chinese food section."" ES: I didn't know that, I'll take a look next time I go. DN: Then, use the pasta sauce to cook the meat and arrange the vegetables. ES: ""Pasta sauce can be used in that way too! What flavor do you mainly use?"" DN: If it is tomato sauce, add chicken or minced meat with vegetables. ES: Minced meat is great, isn't it? It cooks quickly! DN: That's right. Then, I dilute the clam vongole sauce with water, add potatoes, and make it into a soup. ES: It looks like it will become a delicious Western-style soup! DN: Yes. Adding sale items like white fish, clams, and mushrooms makes it very delicious. ES: ""Is the white fish put in as it is? Or is it pre-processed?"" DN: It is often mostly processed, so it is often used as it is. ES: ""I was struggling with fish recipes, so this was very educational!"" DN: Pasta sauce is convenient, isn't it!"
10,"ES: Hello, nice to meet you. DN: Hello. Nice to meet you. ES: Have you been on a trip recently? DN: No, I went outside the prefecture, but I didn't go on a trip. ES: I see, it's quite a difficult time to go out, isn't it? DN: That's right. However, on weekends, I sometimes take the express bus to visit my son in Kansai. ES: ""So you're in the Kansai region! Are you from the Kanto region?"" DN: No. I'm traveling from Aichi Prefecture to Osaka and Kobe. ES: I see, I'm in Tokyo now, but I really want to go to Aichi and Osaka as well. DN: I see. My other son is in Kanagawa, and I sometimes take the bus there too. ES: You're a veteran of bus travel, aren't you! Do you like bus trips? DN: ""The Shinkansen is expensive, but the bus is quite a bargain, so I'm making an effort."" ES: I have also ridden it, but it doesn't cost even half as much as the Shinkansen, does it? DN: I see. There are high-speed buses with capsule seats between Aichi, Osaka, and Tokyo. ES: Capsule! Is it completely private? DN: The capsule is shaped so that you can stretch your legs. It's interesting. ES: That is very intriguing. It seems like privacy will be protected as well. DN: Yes. I always choose a three-row seat when traveling between Aichi and Tokyo, but the capsule is the best. ES: ""Are all three rows capsules?"" DN: Yes. This capsule bus has only 17 seats, and all of them are capsules. ES: There are few seats, aren't there? Is there a restroom on the bus? DN: The buses of this bus company are not running. ES: That's the only thing I'm a bit worried about. Is there a bathroom break along the way? DN: ""There are 3 breaks. The lights are off on the midnight bus, but there are breaks before midnight and around 5 AM."" ES: In that case, it's alright! It seems you can enjoy eating to your heart's content without any worries. DN: Yes. Recently, SAs have been well-equipped, and I have taken a break playing a public piano at the Hamamatsu SA. ES: Oh! They're airing the town piano program on NHK, right? DN: It's been popular lately. ES: ""Are you not appearing in that?"" DN: ""No way, no way! I'm going to play and run away!"""
