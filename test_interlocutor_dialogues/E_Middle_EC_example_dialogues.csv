1,"EC: Good evening, thank you! DG: Good evening, please. EC: Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation? DG: I will go out this weekend, but I will stay home otherwise. EC: ""My family is also staying indoors. Where are you planning to go this weekend?"" DG: ""That's right. I'm participating in a music festival this weekend."" EC: ""Festivals! I have never participated in one before! What is it like?"" DG: It's my first time being outdoors as well, but you can freely move around four different stages! EC: Outdoor festivals are so appealing! Is it like enjoying music by going around to various stages? DG: I think there will also be festival food stalls! I'm looking forward to it! EC: ""Festival food is a new term to me! Looks delicious!!"" DG: ""There are a lot of hearty dishes like meat bowls!"" EC: It's so appealing! With four stages and festival food, is one day enough? DG: I have only secured a one-day ticket, but there are people going for both days! EC: I see! Do you plan how you will go around, or do you go with the flow? DG: I have made plans, but I am prepared for emergencies where I won't be able to go out due to COVID-19. EC: ""It would be extremely disappointing if we can't go despite having made such careful plans."" DG: That's right, but I'm also looking forward to meeting unknown artists without being bound by the schedule! EC: Exploring new things is great! What kind of artists do you like? DG: I often listen to King Gnu these days. EC: ""I have an image of a very beautiful voice!"" DG: I like that vocalist because they are charming. There is a gap. EC: ""I don't know what their face looks like! There's a gap, huh! I'll search for it next time."" DG: He's definitely a mysterious guy who's troubled by not being able to tidy up his own room. EC: Mysterious guy! You have a unique personality. I'm intrigued! DG: Yes, that's right, so I was doing an Instagram live about how I can't get married. EC: I see. It seems like a lot of sisterly types who are totally okay with it would volunteer. DG: ""Indeed! But it's 3 AM, haha. Such an interesting personality!"" EC: ""That's true! It's fascinating! Thank you for teaching me various things."" DG: No, no, I made you listen!"
2,"EC: Hello, nice to meet you. DG: Likewise, please take care of me! EC: ""Recently, is there anything you bought that you're glad you did? Something like, why didn't I buy this sooner?"" DG: Oh, I properly went back to using my own toothbrush. The angle might be a bit different though! EC: Did you use an electric one before? DG: Yes, I bought it because I admired it, but it didn't feel quite right, so I changed it! EC: The commercial makes it seem like electric ones remove dirt really well, but they don't actually feel that refreshing. DG: I feel like it's hard to polish the back and inside areas. EC: I see! I was surprised because I thought it would be easy to polish. DG: ""Also, if it doesn't work out, you can still use it for cleaning."" EC: It's convenient, isn't it? I think one of the good points of manual toothbrushes is that they are cheap, so you can easily replace them if they get frayed. DG: That's right, and with electric ones, you need to charge them and maintain them when they get dirty, so it wasn't an ideal situation. EC: Wow, that's a hassle. I don't want to deal with maintenance and such. It's far from an ideal world. DG: ""Somehow my laziness is gradually being revealed, but I just want to take it easy as much as possible!"" EC: I am also lazy, so I totally understand! You don't want to spend time taking care of your teeth, right? DG: I see. <EC>, is there something you are glad you bought? EC: The mouse with a button on the left thumb was convenient. I think most people are using it. DG: ""Huh, a button? I might not have one."" EC: It is called a 5-button mouse. DG: ""Heh! That's news to me! So it's not specifically for gaming?"" EC: That's not correct! It's around 1200 yen, so I think regular people are using it! DG: When I looked it up just now, I found out you can also go back and forward with it. EC: That's right, that's what's convenient about it. You don't have to go out of your way to move the cursor. DG: ""Eh! I updated my wish list!"" EC: Absolutely! If it's the same price, I definitely recommend the five-button one. DG: I ended up talking about things I hadn't bought! EC: No, no, I'm glad I got to hear it! I was interested in electric toothbrushes! DG: Everyone is different, but convenience might be inconvenient! EC: ""That's true! It was fun, thank you very much."" DG: ""It is I who should be thanking you for the mouse information! Thank you very much."""
3,"EC: Hello DG: Hello! EC: Lately, cooking every day has become a hassle, but are there any easy and frequently made dishes you can recommend? DG: ""Hmm, lately I've been eating nothing but somen. I'm enjoying various arrangements."" EC: What kind of arrangements can you make with somen? I'm curious! DG: Minced meat miso, in the style of tantanmen, or with tomatoes for an Italian style. EC: ""Looks delicious! Do you put things like meat miso and tantanmen directly on top of somen noodles?"" DG: That's right! Sometimes I just prepare it in advance and put it on, and for dan dan noodles, I sometimes use store-bought ones! EC: Sounds good!! Changing the flavor seems like it will make somen noodles enjoyable without getting tired of them! DG: Speaking of which, I tried a chijimi (Korean pancake) recipe from COOKPAD and it was delicious. EC: ""Do you mix it with flour and bake it? I can't imagine what the taste and texture would be like!"" DG: I finely chopped boiled somen and added, if I remember correctly, potato starch? It became chewy! EC: ""Chewy and nice! It made me want to try eating it. I'll try it next time!"" DG: Absolutely, I added a bunch of leftover green onions too, and it was delicious! EC: Green onions are great! I've decided on the menu for tomorrow's dinner. Thank you. DG: No, no. Nowadays, it's convenient because you can make anything if you have Cookpad! EC: Cookpad, do you ever get a miss? DG: Eh! Really! Oh, maybe it's because I don't look at the measurements very much. I just wing it. EC: I think you have a discerning eye. I often end up choosing the wrong thing and have a hard time taking on new challenges. DG: I see, that's not the case! Have you had any misses with certain types? EC: The biggest failure was when I tried to make a rice cooker cake with canned peaches, and it turned out all mushy. DG: It conjured up a terribly tragic scene. EC: That's right. It was likely that my way of making it was bad, but it was still a shock. DG: ""I've never made a rice cooker cake before, but I wonder if it depends on the machine. It's disappointing, isn't it?"" EC: The expectation of being able to eat cake is so big that it makes you feel completely down when it's not met. DG: Certainly. With a rice cooker, you can't check the progress midway, can you? It could be quite disappointing. EC: That's right. Also, the cheesecake made with pizza cheese had a disappointing taste. DG: ""You make quite a lot of sweets, don't you? They're so lovely, really!"" EC: Thank you. I will avoid things that seem likely to fail and do my best to succeed. DG: That's right, sometimes it's better to play it safe!"
4,"EC: Hello! DG: Hello! EC: Do you have any siblings? DG: I am an only child. It's a little lonely! EC: I see. When I was little, I admired being an only child. DG: How many siblings do you have? If it's not too much trouble! EC: I have one younger sister. We used to fight a lot when we were little, but now we get along well. DG: ""I envy having sisters. Sure, things were good in the past, but being alone as an adult is lonely."" EC: ""If you were to have siblings, would you have preferred a sister? My younger sister said she wanted a handsome older brother."" DG: Ah, I understand that feeling, but it seems like I won't be able to let go! EC: Ah, indeed. You might feel jealous of your brother's lover. DG: Oh, by the way, my friend was saying that it's troublesome how close they are with their single brother. EC: I see! Sometimes being too close can be a problem. Indeed, if siblings are too close, it might feel like you don't need a romantic partner. DG: It seems like they spend time playing games and reading manga together, so they say there's no one who understands them better, but on the contrary, I'm worried! EC: ""Certainly, you are the one and only person who understands. I understand your feelings of concern too!"" DG: Do you meet your younger sister frequently? EC: It's about three hours by bullet train, so we can't meet often. But we do communicate through LINE and other means. DG: I see, you are far apart. But it seems fun to be able to talk about various things! EC: Yes, it's fun! Our family has a daughter and a son, but it's a mystery what kind of distance they'll have when they grow up. DG: Certainly. Recently, young people seem to have less desire for marriage, so it's good to have a harmonious and good relationship. EC: Yes, I want them to get along, but when I see them fighting like siblings, it seems like they might sever ties in the future. DG: Oh, the friend I talked about earlier used to get into fistfights when he was little, so he might change in some way! EC: It's surprising. I thought it was a big brother who took good care of his little sister and a little sister who loved her big brother since they were young. DG: No, I was also surprised to hear that it used to be an object of fear. I think becoming an adult is amazing! EC: That's really amazing. People change as they grow. DG: If I think about having children, I would like to have two. EC: I see! If you have the financial means and physical stamina, having five people would seem lively. DG: ""Certainly. The dining table and going out do cost money, don't they? That's something we need to discuss."" EC: Dreams are expanding! Thank you very much! DG: ""The pleasure is mine!"""
5,"EC: Hello! Nice to meet you. AF: Hello, please! EC: When I was parking, I accidentally hit the car and my mood dropped. AF: Oh dear, that sounds tough. Was it a new car? EC: No, it was a used car from the beginning. But I'm worried about the repair costs. AF: Was it a relatively big wound? EC: It's not very big, but even to an amateur, it's clear that the parts are misaligned. AF: It's a bit embarrassing to have visible scars, isn't it? EC: That's right. I'm also worried that the parts might slip and fall off. AF: I also bumped my parents' car a few times when I was a beginner. EC: ""It's your parent's car, right? Did you get scolded?"" AF: He was making excuses, saying that it was hit while it was parked without him knowing. EC: I see!! Smart!! AF: It had already been found out. EC: ""Will it be found out?"" AF: No matter how you look at it, they thought that I, a beginner, had caused the accident. EC: Parental intuition is amazing! AF: At that time, I had caused such a flashy accident that the door mirror was hanging down. EC: ""The mirrors hang down, huh! If it were a new car, I'd probably turn pale."" AF: I think I was quite pale the moment I hit it. EC: Certainly, it must have been tough for the parents too. AF: By the way, do you have any plans to go for a drive? EC: I don't have plans to go for a drive. Do you? AF: In the latter half of the summer vacation, I'm thinking about going somewhere to stay overnight. EC: Sounds great! I'm jealous of your trip!! AF: I usually just stay without meals and find something delicious at a local restaurant. EC: I think such a trip is the most enjoyable! Just thinking about it makes me excited. AF: That's right, saving on hotel costs and enjoying the trip itself is the best way. EC: I understand! Thank you for today. AF: ""Thank you very much as well!"""
6,"EC: Hello, thank you for your time today. AF: Thank you in advance. EC: ""Corona is scary, isn't it?"" AF: Recently, I think it's tough to wear a mask because it's hot. EC: Really! It looks like I'm going to get heatstroke. AF: Every year, I get a mild heatstroke, so I'm worried about going out with a mask. EC: I see. Without a mask, people's eyes also hurt, and it will be a tough summer, won't it? AF: Don't you think the number of people wearing masks outdoors has slightly decreased? EC: Perhaps because it is the countryside, there are still many people who have prejudices about COVID-19, so a lot of people wear masks. AF: I also live in the countryside, and I feel that the percentage of elderly people wearing masks has decreased. EC: I see! It's gradually changing, isn't it? AF: I also recently stopped wearing a mask outdoors, and I have started to feel less conscious of being watched. EC: In that case, it’s good that the worry about heatstroke decreases a bit. AF: This year it was too hot, so I bought a parasol for children. EC: Children feel hot too, don't they? Did you use a parasol when commuting to school? AF: It seems that a few classmates have it. EC: I see. I was just thinking that it must be hot and tough for you when you commute to school. AF: In the morning it's fine, but when I return home I use a parasol. EC: It's the hottest around the time you head home, isn't it? It's great that you can now use a parasol to stay a bit cooler on your way back. AF: Yes, children's parasols are quite light, so I recommend them. EC: I'll try checking out the store next time! AF: Definitely, I was able to buy it for less than 2,000 yen, so it's not that expensive. EC: That's good! Are you doing anything else to prevent heatstroke? AF: I wear a cooling towel around my neck every day. EC: ""I've never used a cooling towel! Doesn't it make your neck all wet?"" AF: You use it by wetting and wringing it out, but it doesn't get that wet—it dries quickly in the middle of summer. EC: I see! It sounds cold and nice! AF: I bought it for children, but it's also comfortable for adults to wear while doing housework. EC: I learned a lot, thank you very much. AF: Thank you, too."
7,"EC: Hello, nice to meet you! AF: Hello, please. EC: Lately, I've been thinking that I need to clean up the house, but I just can't seem to get started. AF: What kind of places do you want to clean up? EC: They are toys and children's clothes that are no longer used. They are filled with memories, so I can't throw them away. AF: I understand! I have kept one of my baby's shoes and clothes from when they were little. EC: ""Do you have any regrets about throwing away one unexpected thing?"" AF: Yes, but I took a photo before disposing of it! EC: I see—photos! That way it seems like it would be harder to forget. AF: ""When bringing home works or other items, I make sure to have them hold it and take a photo."" EC: ""It's a good idea to let the person carry it. Do you also take photos of crafts and works before disposing of them?"" AF: Yes! There's an album for the works, so when you want to see them, you can flip through that album. EC: You are making an album for your work, that's amazing! I've been thinking I need to make one too, but I haven't been able to get around to it. AF: The key is not to accumulate them! I place an order online either on the day I took the photos or the next day. EC: ""I am impressed by the speed of the work! Is it a case of ordering immediately and putting it away as soon as it arrives?"" AF: Yes, so I give the artwork to the child and secretly dispose of it when it breaks. EC: ""It's very informative. Have you ever been scolded or saddened for secretly throwing things away?"" AF: Surprisingly, it seems that the peak for the person was when they created it. EC: Certainly, the peak of crafting is the moment when you finish making it, isn't it? AF: That's right. Sometimes the process of making it is the only fun part. EC: ""Especially with things like paper clay, right? I also thought about taking a photo and secretly throwing it away."" AF: I recommend it, your home will be neat and tidy! EC: It's important to have a comfortable home, isn't it? Rooms like the children's room are so messy that just entering them can be disheartening. AF: Oh, sometimes I hand them a garbage bag and tell them to throw away things they don't need! That's how I handle it. EC: So it's amazing that they'll throw things away! At our house, both I and the kids say that everything has memories attached, so there's no end to it. AF: I tend to throw things away quite often, so my child might have taken after me. EC: The way of tidying up seems to resemble that of one's parents, doesn't it? My parents also have a hard time throwing things away, so I resemble them in that regard. AF: Speaking of which, my mother was also the type to throw things away! EC: Amazing! Thank you for sharing such a meaningful story. AF: ""The pleasure was mine, I had fun."""
8,"EC: Hello, nice to meet you. AF: Hello, please. EC: I am thinking that it's about time to buy a new computer, but what kind of specs does your computer have? AF: I'm not sure about the specs, but Windows is the latest. EC: I see. For some reason, I often end up with devices that freeze easily or are slow to update, which is frustrating. AF: I'm not particular about it, so I'll buy a cheap used one for tens of thousands of yen! EC: It's second-hand, isn't it? What kind of store and criteria do you use to choose it? AF: Let's see, I'll check the price at the Rakuten store, then I'll have my husband confirm if it's okay, and then I'll buy it. EC: Your husband is knowledgeable about computers! It’s reassuring to have him check things, isn’t it? AF: I don't know the detailed specifications, so I leave it up to my husband. EC: Sounds good. At my place, I am told to choose myself since I use it often. AF: In that case, it might be a good idea to consult with the shop and decide. EC: I see. If you consult with the store to choose, it seems like the probability of making a mistake will be reduced. AF: Smartphones are high-spec nowadays, so I don't know which one to choose. EC: There are a lot of smartphones, right? I'd like to try Google Pixel. AF: I recently replaced my smartphone. EC: What kind of smartphone did you switch to? AF: It's the latest 5G from Tone Mobile, but I have no idea what 5G is all about. EC: I often hear about 5G! But it doesn't seem like something to get excited about, saying ""It's 5G!"" AF: There's not much difference other than it runs smoother than my previous smartphone, which feels like a bit of a waste. EC: I see. Since it's 5G, you would want to experience even more speed, right? AF: ""Does 5G have anything to do with speed? I just found out."" EC: I thought it was related! But I'm not confident, as I'm not well-informed. AF: I see. It's surprising how well the cameras on recent smartphones take pictures! EC: I understand! But maybe because my smartphone is relatively cheap, the zoom function is disappointing. AF: When I seriously take photos, I bring a digital single-lens reflex camera instead of a smartphone. EC: As expected, it's necessary to use them properly. AF: I don't have much knowledge, so I can't keep up with new things. EC: ""Same here. Thank you very much!"" AF: Yes, same to you. Thank you very much!"
9,"EC: Hello! AF: Hello, please. EC: Have you been watching any TV shows or anime recently? AF: Yes, I'm watching Naruto and Bleach. EC: Wow, both of them are great! I want to see them too! AF: Did you know? EC: I know! I’ve only read partway through, and I want to binge-read it all at once someday. AF: Both have been adapted into anime and have been running for quite a long time. EC: Both of them have ended in the manga, but is the anime still continuing? AF: I have only watched partway through the anime and not the original work, but Naruto has been fully adapted into an anime. EC: I see! Now I want to see it! AF: Naruto's main character is so cute that I ended up feeling like a mother watching over his growth. EC: ""Ahaha, it's interesting to see things from a mother's perspective!"" AF: ""That Naruto who was so small has grown up to be so strong—isn't that what you mean?"" EC: That's how it is, huh! Naruto, if I remember correctly, has a sequel, right? AF: ""The sequel is called 'Boruto: Naruto Next Generations'."" EC: If Naruto were a child, I might be able to read it from a grandmother's perspective! AF: ""I was a bit surprised by Naruto's marriage partner!"" EC: ""I still don't know! It's an unexpected partner!"" AF: Okay, I'll keep it a secret! I just started watching Bleach recently. EC: I see! Bankai is cool, isn't it? AF: Currently, Jujutsu Kaisen is popular, but I prefer Bleach. EC: ""I don't know anything about Jujutsu at all. I think Bleach is really interesting because all the characters stand out."" AF: I quickly got hooked on Bleach, and I'm thinking I want to watch the movies too. EC: Oh, there's a movie too! I didn't know that. AF: Fukushi-kun and Hana-chan are playing the lead roles. EC: I want to see it!! They should show it on Friday Roadshow. AF: I'm pretty sure you could also watch it on Netflix. EC: I don't have Netflix. I'll watch it someday! Thank you very much. AF: ""The pleasure is mine, thank you."""
10,"EC: Good evening! AF: Good evening! EC: Do you have your air conditioner cleaned every year? It's expensive, isn't it? AF: I don't do it every year; it's about once every three years. EC: ""Once every three years is fine. I was hesitant because the company told me it should be done every year."" AF: It's about time, but rather, it's time to replace the air conditioner. EC: Air conditioners are expensive, aren't they? AF: I sometimes think that cleaning on my own with a spray I bought is enough. EC: I've seen a spray at the pharmacy! Does it get pretty clean? AF: ""I haven't tried it yet, I'm a little worried it might break."" EC: That's right, you're worried about it breaking, aren't you? AF: Somehow, I'd prefer to do the maintenance myself rather than outsourcing it. EC: I see. It makes me want to save money. AF: The more things you can do on your own, the more you can save. EC: I think so! Are you good at saving money? AF: I'm not good at saving money in small ways, so instead, I invest. EC: You're investing, right? Is it through something like NISA? AF: I am investing in both NISA and iDeCo, but within the limits of my savings and deposits. EC: That's amazing. What did you study to learn this? AF: It's from books, and then I learned it while managing it. EC: You read the book and then put it into practice, right? Aren't you afraid of taking losses? AF: In actual shopping, there are times when you make mistakes and lose out, right? That's how I feel. EC: ""That's an amazing quote! I feel lighter at heart."" AF: After all, since it's within my own financial means, even if I lose money, it won't be a significant amount. EC: I see. So it's best to keep it to an amount that you can accept losing. AF: I think so. And I am overwhelmingly bad at regular shopping and often fail. EC: I see! Somehow, I'm starting to feel like I want to invest. AF: I can't easily recommend it, but investing in Rakuten Points has low risk and is easy to start. EC: I've seen information about investing with Rakuten points! I'll check it out!! Thank you very much. AF: The pleasure is mine, thank you very much!"
