1,"HF: Hello GL: Hello, nice to meet you. HF: Have you been into anything lately? GL: That's right. Maybe it's decluttering. HF: I see! You mean a minimalist! GL: It's not to the point of being a minimalist, but it feels like I'm following the trend. HF: What kind of things have you decluttered recently? GL: Sure. The translated sentence is: ""Yes, it is. Documents, books, clothes, and so on."" HF: I see! Was there a lot? GL: Yes, I had been accumulating them for several years, so I disposed of them all at once! HF: I see. Do you like reading books? GL: I see. I haven't been reading much lately. So, I have gotten rid of most of them. HF: What kind of genres did you read before? GL: I see. Modern literature and self-help books, I suppose. HF: That's nice! Do you read manga? GL: ""I have recently stopped reading manga altogether, do you read manga often?"" HF: I don't read much myself, but recently I've been following One Piece. GL: I see. It looks like One Piece is available for free. There's also a movie playing. HF: That's right. You can read it for free now! Have you ever read One Piece? GL: Yes, the standalone books are probably in the first half, and the anime was up to a few years ago, but I have reviewed the story for now. HF: I see! What kind of manga have you been reading so far? GL: I see. I was reading some old manga due to the influence of an acquaintance. Things like Dragon Ball and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. HF: I really like Dragon Ball a lot too! Have you watched the anime? GL: I see. Yes, but I haven't watched the recent Dragon Ball anime. HF: I don't know much about the recent ones either! Have you seen Z or GT? GL: Yes, I've only watched up to a certain point in GT, but that's really all I've seen! HF: I see! I really like GT's songs and listen to them often. GL: That's right. I occasionally listen to music! HF: Sounds good! Anime songs have many good tunes, so please try listening to various ones. GL: Yes, thank you very much!"
2,"HF: Hello! Nice to meet you. GL: Hello, nice to meet you! HF: What kind of club activities did you participate in during your undergraduate days? GL: I was in the swimming club. HF: How long have you been swimming? GL: It's been 12 years. HF: ""It's long, isn't it! How old were you when you started?"" GL: Since about the age of 7. HF: That's amazing! Do you still go swimming even now? GL: Yes, it's not an exaggeration to say that this is the only sport I can do. HF: I see! I'm envious of your ability to swim. GL: No, no, did you play any sports? HF: I was playing soccer and tennis. GL: I see! Are both of them club activities? HF: Both are club activities! GL: Outdoor activities are tough in the heat, aren't they? HF: It's tough! Even now, I still play soccer occasionally, but it's so hot that I get exhausted quickly. GL: I see. I used to play soccer quite a while ago too, so I occasionally play futsal. HF: Were you taking soccer lessons? GL: Yes, it was when I was young, for about six years. I'm not good at it. HF: You were pretty good! Do you have a favorite soccer team? GL: I see. I don't particularly have a favorite, but if I had to choose, it would be the local J-League team. HF: I see! Have you ever been to a game? GL: Yes, I went to watch it when I was young. I remember going down to the field and having some experiences too. HF: That's amazing! Haven't you gone recently? GL: Yes, I haven't gone recently, so I would like to go if I have the chance. I mostly watch it on TV. HF: After all, watching it on TV is more comfortable, isn't it? But if you actually go, it's really exciting, so please give it a try. GL: I see! I definitely want to go. The sense of presence is different, isn't it? HF: It's fun to sing cheering songs. GL: Indeed, it gets exciting."
3,"HF: Hello! Nice to meet you. GL: Hello, nice to meet you! HF: What are your plans for today? GL: I think I’ll go shopping in the early afternoon. HF: Sounds good! What will you buy? GL: Even though I'm going shopping, I have meal coupons valid until today, so the main focus will probably be on meals. HF: Oh! Sounds good. Is it dinner? GL: Yes, that's right. It seems like we either use the meal voucher for lunch or take out something for dinner. HF: What do you plan to eat? GL: For lunch, maybe yakiniku, and for dinner, perhaps gyudon. HF: ""Yakiniku is nice! I often go for solo yakiniku."" GL: Is it true? Is it a place where you can do solo BBQ? HF: That's right! GL: ""That's nice. There are only chain stores near me."" HF: ""That's also a chain!"" GL: I see. What is the name of the shop? HF: It's a restaurant called Yakiniku Like. GL: This is the first time I’ve heard of it. I’ll look into it. I also want to eat yakiniku as easily as gyudon. HF: I think the cheapest one was around 600 yen. GL: ""One plate?"" HF: The set includes rice, 100g of meat, soup, and kimchi. GL: That looks really delicious. And it's cheap, too. HF: Moreover, you can have free refills of rice. GL: ""This is the best. I could eat several bowls of rice."" HF: That's right! Moreover, there are plenty of toppings and they have everything. GL: I see, is it a side dish for the meal? HF: ""It might have been on the table, but I don't really remember that."" GL: Is that so? Since I like grilled meat, I'm envious that you can easily go by yourself. HF: Weekdays are quite empty, so please come! GL: Yes! I'll go and try it!"
4,"HF: Hello GL: Hello, nice to meet you. HF: What kind of part-time jobs have you done so far? GL: ""Customer service, computer work, and event-related tasks, I guess."" HF: Is the customer service industry related to food and beverage? GL: Yes, it's for takeout! HF: What food was it? GL: It's omurice! HF: It looks delicious! Did you have a staff meal or something? GL: ""If there were leftovers, I could have them."" HF: I'm so jealous! What kind of work did you do on the computer? GL: It's a call center! HF: I work at a call center. GL: Is it true! I might not be very suited for it! HF: Me too. It’s a simple task, so I can't keep doing it. GL: Certainly, if you lose concentration, it's over, isn't it? HF: I understand. How long have you been doing it? GL: About two years, I guess. HF: It's quite long. GL: Yes, it got better once I got used to it, but at first, I was really terrible. HF: I understand. Is it an outgoing call? Or an incoming call? GL: The basic principle is to receive electricity. HF: I see. The call center has a high turnover rate, doesn't it? GL: That's right. It's just that the people around me were good people, so I was helped. HF: The environment around you is the most important thing in any workplace, isn't it? GL: Yes, honestly, I think I am influenced by others, and it was the same when I worked in customer service. HF: I understand! Are the events one-time only? GL: Yes, like around the end of the year. HF: Sounds good! I will look it up. GL: Yes, seasonal items are high-priced and easy, so definitely."
5,"HF: Good evening! GH: Good evening! HF: How did you spend your day today? GH: I was out all day today. HF: Are you shopping or something? GH: That's right! Like the 100-yen shop and the bank. HF: What did you buy at the 100 yen shop? GH: ""I bought storage items, such as daily necessities."" HF: That's good! This is educational! GH: Storage cases are very convenient. HF: That's right! Have you bought anything else recently? GH: Recently, I bought Blu-ray playback software. It was expensive. HF: Oh! That's nice! Is the Blu-ray something you can watch on TV? GH: I bought it so that I can view it on my computer! HF: I see! Do you use subscriptions like Netflix? GH: I use it! It's Amazon Prime. HF: I feel the same way! Have you seen any movies recently? GH: I watched 007. HF: I've never heard of it! Is it a drama? Is it a movie? GH: ""It's an overseas movie! Have you heard of James Bond?"" HF: I've never heard of it. What kind of story is it? GH: Simply put, it's a story about a spy. HF: That sounds interesting! I'll check it out next time! GH: Sure, sure. What kind of movie are you going to watch? HF: I often watch dramas! GH: ""The drama is nice, isn't it! Is it from overseas?"" HF: I like things from Japan! GH: I see! I often watch it too. HF: I understand! I often empathize with the protagonist's feelings. GH: It really moves you, doesn't it?"
6,"HF: Good evening. GH: Good evening! HF: Do you have any hobbies or ways you spend your holidays? GH: My hobby is gardening. HF: Are you growing something? GH: I am growing passion fruit now. HF: Sounds good! How long until it can be harvested? GH: This year, so far, it's about 10, I guess. HF: ""There are so many! How long does it take until harvest?"" GH: ""Grow them from the beginning of summer and they will color up by midsummer!"" HF: I see! I didn't have much knowledge about it, so I'll look it up. GH: Of course. It was surprisingly easy to grow. HF: Are you growing anything else? GH: I am growing basil now, but in summer there are a lot of summer vegetables. HF: ""Basil looks delicious! What are some representative vegetables?"" GH: It's a tomato! HF: Is the tomato a cherry tomato? GH: It's mini! Since it's on the balcony, there isn't much space. HF: Certainly, large ones are indeed difficult, aren't they? GH: That's right. I want a farm. HF: Sure! Are you interested in things like farming? GH: Someday I'd like to try farming, but rather than as a profession, it would be better to do home cultivation as a hobby. HF: Indeed, it's nice to enjoy hobbies rather than work. GH: That's right. I want to eat fresh vegetables. HF: Although it is quite difficult, I do not want to become a soccer player. GH: It's fun to watch, isn't it? HF: ""Yes, that's right, at this age my body just doesn't move."" GH: I don't have the energy to start something new now either. HF: I simply like moving my body, so I want to start from what I can do. GH: That's right!"
7,"HF: Good evening. GH: Good evening. HF: Please tell me your favorite food. GH: My favorite food is eggs. HF: Eggs are great! What is your favorite way to eat them? GH: Is it omurice? HF: Omurice sounds great! Do you prefer ketchup or demi-glace sauce? GH: I prefer demi-glace! HF: ""Demi-glace is delicious, isn't it! I like the omurice at Gusto."" GH: ""It's nice, isn't it! By the way, which side are you on?"" HF: ""I'll have demi-glace sauce too."" GH: It's the same! I'm starting to feel hungry. HF: Got it! By the way, do you have a favorite type of sushi topping? GH: ""It's tuna. It's a classic, isn't it?"" HF: Tuna is great! GH: What do you like? HF: I like salmon! GH: That's great! I love it too. HF: ""It's delicious, isn't it! What do you order first?"" GH: The best is negitoro! HF: I will eat about two plates of negitoro. GH: ""It's delicious, isn't it? Sometimes I treat myself to fatty tuna."" HF: I see! I went to Sushiro today. GH: Sounds good! I haven't been there in a long time. HF: Do you have a favorite sushi chain? GH: It's Sushiro. HF: ""As expected, it's delicious! I think Kura Sushi is great when you have kids."" GH: That's right! Recently, I end up getting takeout no matter what. HF: I see! Either way, it's delicious. GH: Sure! The translation of 'ですね！' is 'That's right!'"
8,"HF: Good evening. GH: Good evening! HF: Have you traveled recently? GH: Recently, I haven't been able to do it. HF: Which one did you go to last? GH: It's Kyushu! HF: Sounds good! Where in Kyushu? GH: It's different from Fukuoka to Oita. HF: Amazing! How many nights did you stay? GH: Five nights, right! HF: If it's for five nights, it seems like you'll be able to go around quite a lot, which is good. GH: We explored quite a lot! I went with my family and it was a great memory. HF: ""Is there any other trip that left the most impression on you?"" GH: The trip to Tokyo was also impressive. HF: Sounds good! Did you go to Disney? GH: I went to Disney! HF: ""Is it Land or Sea?"" GH: I went to both! HF: Sounds good! Which one did you like better? GH: The child was happy with the land, so it's land, isn't it? HF: Land is the classic choice! I like the scenery at Sea. GH: Sure! Fireworks at DisneySea are wonderful, aren't they? HF: Since it is modeled after an Italian city, I would like to visit the real one someday. GH: That's right! I admire the authentic Disney. HF: It seems that it's quite large and can't be covered in one day. GH: That's right! It looks like it's going to be quite an elaborate trip. HF: My friend said it took them five days to go around. GH: That's amazing! It's really spacious. HF: I want to save money and go while I'm still a student. GH: Oh! That's great! Absolutely!"
9,"HF: Good evening. GQ: Good evening! HF: How was your day today? GQ: ""During the day I work part-time, and when I come back, I do housework."" HF: ""Thank you for your hard work with your part-time job and housework! I didn't have my part-time job today, so I was studying."" GQ: Are you a student? HF: I am a student! GQ: ""Studying, impressive! I only did it before tests."" HF: Thank you very much. The company where I got a job told me to study... GQ: Ah, you already have a job offer. Wonderful! HF: Thank you very much! Next week is the unofficial job offer ceremony! GQ: Congratulations! The future looks bright, how exciting. HF: Thank you. I'm half excited, half anxious. GQ: ""Is your job in your hometown?"" HF: Since my assignment will be decided at the beginning of the year, I don't know yet, but I think it will likely be in my hometown. I hope so. GQ: ""It's a big company, isn't it? Is there a possibility of a transfer?"" HF: There is also a possibility of being transferred. I love my hometown, so I don't want to leave. GQ: I see. It's nice that you like your hometown. I'm sure your family must be happy too. HF: That's right! It's tough not being able to meet friends as much as family, so I'm hoping to be assigned to my hometown. GQ: You have many friends, don't you? That sounds fun. HF: From next year, I will become a working adult, so I think I need to work hard with a sense of responsibility. GQ: Great! But friendship and romance are also necessary in life. Please enjoy everything. HF: That's right, I want to experience both fun and tough times in my twenties and become stronger. GQ: Have you not experienced any hardships yet? HF: There may be competitions in areas such as romance, entrance exams, and club activities, but perhaps I haven't had truly painful experiences from the bottom of my heart. GQ: That is a happy thing. But I've lived more than twice as long, and there aren't really that many things I would call tough. HF: I see. My mother often tells me the same thing, that in life, you never know if something good or bad will happen, so I want to take everything positively. GQ: I strongly agree with your mother's opinion. Please cherish that idea. HF: Yes! I will make it my motto! GQ: ""I'm sorry for sounding so arrogant. Your motto is correct."" HF: Oh, I apologize for the typo! Thank you!"
10,"HF: Good evening! GQ: Good evening! HF: Which travel destination has been the most memorable for you so far? GQ: Hokkaido, right? HF: Hokkaido is nice! Which city is it? GQ: I went to various places using my friend's family home as a base. HF: Your friend lives there, right? I'm jealous! Have you ever been to Hakodate? GQ: Yes, I have. But it's so long ago that I don't remember clearly. HF: I see! But I'm jealous! The night view of Hakodate looks really beautiful in photos, and I want to see it. GQ: Yes, I vaguely remember that. HF: Where else did you go in Hokkaido? GQ: I don't remember the place, but seeing a wild fox left an impression on me. It was cute! HF: Wild foxes are amazing!! I've seen wild deer in the mountains, but foxes are rare. GQ: Yes! I also saw deer. Also, the quality of the snow when I went skiing was completely different from that in Honshu. HF: I see! How was it different? Did it feel smoother? GQ: Yes, yes! It was so smooth! HF: I'm jealous! Do you like winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding? GQ: A long time ago, I went skiing because I was taken along. HF: I see! I'm not good with the cold in the first place, so I can't do it. But I quite like winter! GQ: I was also born in winter, so I love winter. I wonder if I like the snow. HF: Since I was also born in winter, I like it because there are many events like birthdays and Christmas. GQ: Christmas is nice, isn't it? It makes me excited. HF: I understand! I'm no longer at the age to receive presents, but... GQ: ""You're at the age where you have someone to give an expensive present to, right?"" HF: That's right! I gave a present last year, so I would be happy if I could give one again this year. GQ: I pray that you have a good Christmas. It's still a bit early though. HF: Thank you very much! Yes, indeed, two months have flown by so quickly! GQ: I will be Santa for the children again this year. HF: Sounds good! I want to have a warm family too! GQ: You will definitely be able to have it! HF: Thank you very much."
