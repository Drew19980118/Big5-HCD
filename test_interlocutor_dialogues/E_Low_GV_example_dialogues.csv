1,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you. GL: Hello, nice to meet you too! GV: Are you doing any part-time job? GL: I'm not doing anything special right now! My main work is short-term part-time jobs, so are you doing any part-time jobs? GV: I can't write in detail, but right now I'm working in customer service. I'm not a host or anything like that. GL: I see. I have also experienced working in customer service in the past! GV: You could say short-term, I also did some one-off part-time jobs! I still do them occasionally now. GL: I see. Which do you prefer, short-term or long-term part-time jobs? Does it depend on the content? GV: I think single-day jobs are generally better. The pay is relatively good, and if you don't like the place, you can quit after one day. GL: ""That's right. I think both relationships and money are better on a one-time basis! Where are you registered?"" GV: I can't mention the name here, but it's in a pretty famous place! GL: I see! I'm sorry for bringing up something so personal. There are pros and cons depending on the location, aren't there! GV: That's right. It really varies from bad to good. GL: What type of part-time job do you prefer, working (tasks) or customer service? GV: ""Is it work? Actually, I'm not very good at customer service."" GL: I understand. I also prefer doing the work, but I feel there are more job listings for customer service. GV: I think it's a good idea to improve your communication skills through customer service work in preparation for future job hunting. GL: That's right. Human relationships are important, aren't they? People have likes and dislikes, but we can't afford to be leisurely about it, can we? GV: When you join a company, you can't choose who you interact with. I'm not in a position to speak authoritatively, though. GL: No, no, that's right. It's difficult because we have to interact with people at the very least. GV: Which industry are you considering for employment? GL: At the moment, it's in the medical field! GV: ""That's cool! Does that mean university lasts for six years?"" GL: That's right. Since you need to attend for 6 years to be qualified! GV: ""Medical school? I've heard that the studies are incredibly tough. Good luck!"" GL: No, no, it's not that grand! Medical school is cool. I used to aim for it before! GV: ""So, does that mean pharmacy or nursing?"" GL: That kind of thing! GV: I hope COVID-19 has subsided by the time we graduate. GL: Yes, I would be happy if it improves even a little!"
2,"GV: Hello! What kind of hobbies do you have? GL: I don't particularly have any hobbies, but if I had to say, it would be swimming. GV: I also go swimming at the municipal pool sometimes! GL: Really? I also occasionally go swimming at the community gym! Did you do swimming? GV: I used to attend a swimming class when I was in elementary school. GL: I see. I haven't been exercising much lately, and I thought I should move my body once in a while... GV: I originally didn't exercise at all, but recently I've been going to the gym to lose weight! GL: I see! How many times a week do you go to the gym? GV: About 5 times a week. On days when I don't have plans, I usually go without fail. GL: Eh, you go there a lot! That's amazing! GV: ""I have already finished job hunting and earned all my credits, so I have a lot of free time now."" GL: I see. So, you have time now! What are you doing at the gym? GV: The main equipment is a bicycle machine. I ride about 20km a day and burn around 300kcal. GL: Bikes are nice. I like them too! Oh, that's quite amazing! GV: It is said that 300 kcal is a rough guideline, so I follow that. I also do some strength training. GL: I see! What kind of strength training do you do? GV: I don't understand the terms, but I'm doing things like pulling weights down with my hands. GL: Oh, I've seen that! It looks pretty intense! GV: You can adjust the weight yourself there, so there is no problem! GL: I see! I'm currently going to a kickboxing gym! GV: I see! Is it like kicking a sandbag with your foot? GL: Sure! That menu is available too, but face-to-face interactions are more common, right? GV: That's amazing! It seems a bit scary for me, and I don't think I could easily try it. GL: No, no, I'm not good at sports at all and I'm not strong in fights, and I don't get into them! GV: The best thing is not to fight. I also basically never do. GL: Yes! I still want to get stronger, so I'm going to a gym that a friend of mine goes to! GV: I have similar motivations, and after joining the company, I didn't want to be underestimated by those around me, so I've been working hard on strength training! GL: I see. It's true that if you're muscular, you're less likely to be underestimated! GV: I think it's quite an important element after all. GL: Let's work hard on strength training together!"
3,"GV: Hello. Do you have any recommended anime or manga? GL: Hello, I don't really read manga much. Do you have any recommendations? GV: I actually don't watch a lot either. The currently popular ""Spy x Family"" is quite recommended! GL: Oh, I've seen a little bit of Spy x Family! Is the second season of the anime going to be broadcast? GV: I think the second season is scheduled to air in October! GL: I see. Oh, I watched a little bit of the anime called Kaguya-sama: Love is War that was on a while ago! GV: ""Kaguya-sama is one of the anime I want to watch someday!"" GL: ""Really? I think it concluded the other day based on the anime I was watching! It had a comedic tone and was easy to watch!"" GV: I believe the original manga has also been completed. I want to watch both the manga and the anime. GL: I wanted to see the original work! Also, another person I talked to recommended Golden Kamuy! GV: I think my sister has the Golden Kamuy manga. I'll read a little of the first volume later. GL: Oh, really! Everyone was just saying it's interesting! Definitely! GV: If you like cars, how about Initial D? It's an old work, but I think it's very interesting! GL: ""I watched a bit of the anime Initial D. The characters are unique and it's quite interesting, isn't it?"" GV: I like Mazda cars partly because of the influence of Initial D! GL: ""I see! If you were to get a license, would it be for manual?"" GV: The plan is for an automatic car, right? Manuals are cool, but I have absolutely no confidence that I can drive one well. GL: I have a manual license, but I think an automatic license is easier to get! GV: How is it actually to drive a manual car? GL: ""I thought it was difficult to drive while changing gears! If you like it, I recommend it."" GV: It seems quite difficult until you get used to it. I'll be satisfied with an automatic. GL: It's not as hard to drive as in Initial D! I think you can drive an automatic really smoothly! GV: Well, in the real world, there shouldn't be any street racing, so I feel that as long as it can be used as a means of transportation, that's enough. GL: That's right. It's usually convenient! But I do find it a bit fun when driving on mountain roads. GV: Once I get my license, I plan to practice driving in the nearby mountains. I'm a little worried about getting car sick, though. GL: Actually, before I started driving, I used to get pretty bad car sickness, but I think I don't get as car sick while I'm driving. GV: I've heard that indeed the driver himself doesn't get that drunk. GL: Yes, I'm not very good at driving either, but I've never gotten car sick, so I think that's not a problem! GV: I see! I'll do my best at the driving school! GL: Yes! I wish you the best of luck!"
4,"GV: Hello. Have you ever donated blood? GL: Hello, yes, I have been there once for an internship experience! GV: Does ""practical training"" mean you were the one drawing blood? GL: No, no, I volunteered without pay, choosing from caregiving, blood donation, and hospital visits based on my experience in the medical field! GV: I see. How was it? GL: On the last day, I actually donated blood! I didn't feel particularly unwell or anything! GV: So you actually donated blood! I also donated blood for the first time the other day. GL: Yes! I was really surprised to see so many people actually volunteering and donating blood! Is that so! GV: I also hardly had any health issues like anemia! It’s surprising that I didn’t become anemic. GL: That's right! They took a full 400 mL, but surprisingly it's not a big deal! GV: In my case, I didn't know my blood type until now, so I was happy to learn it for the first time during blood donation. GL: I see! You can find out your blood type, and it can also substitute for a blood test, so it's like killing two birds with one stone! GV: I don't know much about medical care, but I found it quite interesting to see various test results. GL: That's right. I think it's very important to be health-conscious from now on! You can donate blood regularly too! GV: ""I'm thinking of going again once November starts!"" GL: I see! I heard from someone else that blood donation facilities also have their own unique characteristics! GV: The other day I donated blood at a blood donation car. Next time, I want to go to a proper facility. GL: I see! The blood donation facility I went to felt like a café, which was quite surprising! GV: That's something to admire. I'll look into finding a good facility! GL: Yes! Definitely! GV: What is your blood type? GL: I'm type O! I can share my blood with anyone! GV: I was also type O! I was hoping that if my Rh factor was negative it would be rare and make me happy, but of course it was positive. GL: It's the same, isn't it! That's right. I also had a positive outcome! GV: ""Are there any negative people around you? Perhaps there aren't any?"" GL: ""I haven't heard about it. The girl in the training pair couldn't have her blood drawn due to anemia!"" GV: Certainly, only relatively healthy people can have their blood drawn, so that happens too. GL: Yes, especially people who are prone to anemia cannot donate blood, that's what the blood donation staff said! GV: ""If you end up drawing out 400ml, it's inevitable that it will turn out like that, right?"" GL: Yes, health is important!"
5,"GV: Good morning. I look forward to working with you. HA: Good morning! GV: What is your child's grade level approximately? HA: Yes, the older one is in first grade, and the younger one is in preschool. GV: I see. It's quite a tough time, isn't it? HA: I see, but when they become elementary school students, they can do a lot of different things. GV: ""Are you still having quite a hard time taking care of the younger child?"" HA: Still having trouble with occasional accidents, aren't we? GV: It seems like dealing with accidents is quite difficult, isn't it? HA: Sometimes, when I wake up in the morning, the mattress is soaking wet. GV: I've heard that it's good to lay a plastic bag under the sheets. HA: Ah, it certainly looks good! But my sleeping posture is so bad that I don't know where I'm sleeping. GV: That is frightening. HA: That's right. So if we draw, we have to cover the entire surface. GV: Don't you wear diapers? HA: As you correctly noticed, recently we had been reverting to using diapers at night. GV: I think it's fine to let your child graduate from diapers at their own pace without rushing them too much. HA: That's right, I'm thinking now that if I can just be a little more patient. GV: Please do your best! HA: Thank you very much! Do you have any children there? GV: I am a university student now! HA: I see! Is your university still remote? GV: It seems that face-to-face interactions are partially resuming. HA: ""It seems so, you say? You haven't done it yourself yet?"" GV: I attended for a little while. Now that I have completed my credits, I am not taking any more lectures. HA: ""Oh, I see, are you a job-hunting student?"" GV: ""Job hunting is already finished. I am currently a fourth-year university student."" HA: I see! So are you free then? GV: There is plenty of time. I am thinking of going to the driving school eventually. HA: That's great! Once you start working, you won't be able to go."
6,"GV: Good morning. I look forward to working with you. HA: Thank you for your cooperation today! GV: Is the PTA tough? HA: Ah, I haven't done anything. I wonder if I should be doing something? GV: Is there no PTA in the current elementary schools? HA: ""It seems there is one, but is it decided by grade level like a duty roster?"" GV: I don't really understand it very well. HA: That's right. However, it seems like work has significantly decreased due to COVID. GV: That is quite a happy thing, isn't it? I remember my mother used to complain a lot in the past too. HA: ""That's right, it's not the current era. I think everything should be outsourced."" GV: I truly think that is the case. HA: Some people can't afford it, so I wonder if that's why it ends up that way. GV: I think the government should spend more money on education. HA: ""That's right, especially with research positions, I think something should be done about it."" GV: I often hear that it's more difficult to job hunt after getting a PhD. It's unfortunate. HA: I see. Is it because of age disadvantage? GV: I think that's probably the case. I believe there are quite few environments in Japan where one can utilize the expertise of a doctorate. HA: I see. In that case, aren't there fewer people who go on to the doctoral program? GV: It should be few. HA: As expected, that's the case. By the way, are you in the sciences or the humanities? GV: I'm a science major! There are quite a lot of people going to graduate school. HA: ""Does a science degree make it easier to find a job? What about graduate school?"" GV: I don't think there is a significant difference, but I believe having a master's degree might be advantageous for development positions that require specialized expertise. HA: I see! Are you looking for a job in the field you studied? GV: I think it depends on the field. If it’s a niche field, I think you inevitably have to look at different aspects. HA: That's right, there seem to be few jobs. By the way, what is your major? GV: I am majoring in mathematics for the time being. HA: Mathematics! I can't imagine what kind of job you can get with it. GV: Actually, I also got a job at a company that is mostly unrelated to mathematics. HA: I see, it's sad that it ended up like that."
7,"GV: Good morning. Thank you in advance. HA: Thank you in advance! GV: Do you have any hobbies you've been into recently? HA: I've always liked watching stage performances. GV: I see. Do you watch Takarazuka or something like that? HA: I used to watch Takarazuka a lot in the past. GV: ""Did you not only watch the video, but also actually go to the theater?"" HA: Yes, I often went to the Takarazuka Grand Theater in Tokyo! GV: Personally, I don't understand it at all, but I would like to go someday. HA: Is that so? Do you not watch plays very often? GV: As far as I remember, I don't have any such experiences. HA: I see, are you not very interested in art appreciation? GV: I don't really do that much. Since I have a lot of free time now, I'd like to visit a museum sometime. HA: Museums are interesting, aren't they? If you live near Tokyo, there's a wonderful one in Ueno. GV: Since I live in Kanagawa, it's relatively easy for me to visit Ueno! HA: I see, that's nice! Which part of Kanagawa is it? GV: I live in Atsugi. HA: ""A friend lived in Atsugi. It takes more than an hour by train, right?"" GV: That's right. However, since my commute to university is long, I'm used to spending long hours on the train. HA: College students around the Kanto area are like that, aren't they? But it seems like the crowded trains would be really stressful. GV: There is a little stress. I've gotten used to it recently. HA: That's right. Is the university in Tokyo? GV: Yes! I am attending a university in Tokyo. HA: I see! So do you sometimes get off somewhere with your commuter pass and go out to have fun? GV: That's right! It's convenient because you can go to quite a few places just with a commuter pass. HA: That's right! I felt the same way! For example, what kind of city are you in? GV: ""Like Machida, for example."" HA: ""Machida? Shopping?"" GV: I often play at the game center with my friends. HA: Game centers still exist even now!"
8,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you. HA: I look forward to working with you today. GV: Have there been any happy events recently? HA: Hmm, let's see, recently I got to know someone through my hobby. GV: Sounds good! What hobby is it? HA: ""There is a commentator I like, and I became friends with someone who also likes them."" GV: That's great! Did you become friends on Twitter or something? HA: That's right, as we were talking, we got along well and ended up following each other! GV: ""Is it something like a Vtuber?"" HA: ""It's a game commentary team!"" GV: I see! When you say team, do you mean a team for FPS or something like that? HA: No, we do game commentary with four people. Things like RPGs. GV: ""Oh, I see. I didn't know that before."" HA: ""That's right. There are quite a few people, multiple people."" GV: What is the name of the team? If it's not too much trouble, may I ask? HA: Are you familiar with the men of Naples? GV: I'm not sure. I think I'll look it up later. HA: ""It's quite minor. That's why having comrades was all the more touching."" GV: That is certainly delightful. I can somewhat understand that feeling too. HA: Do you ever connect over something you like? GV: That's right! I also often become friends with people on Twitter! HA: I see! What prompted it? GV: It's a hobby. I often get to know people on Twitter who play mahjong. HA: ""Mahjong, is it? Do you sometimes play with those people?"" GV: I play! I sometimes meet acquaintances from Twitter at mahjong parlors and play mahjong together. HA: I see! What was your impression when you first met them? GV: It depends on the person, but there are quite a few people whose impression on Twitter is different from in real life. HA: Is it like you can get a glimpse of their personality that you couldn't understand from the text? GV: I see. There are cases where someone might be insidious on Twitter but actually handsome in person. HA: ""Handsome! Your stock is likely to go up!"""
9,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you. HA: Thank you in advance! GV: Have you done anything to get your children to eat vegetables? HA: I've already given up. If you don't eat this, you won't get any snacks! Or using food as bait. GV: That sounds tough. If you dislike vegetables that much, it's unavoidable to entice you with bait. HA: That's right. In addition, I don't eat meat, so there's nothing I can eat. GV: It is surprising that you can't eat meat. HA: It seems like something hard doesn't work. GV: Many children seem to have difficulty with raw vegetables, don't they? Would it still be a problem if they were cooked, such as by stir-frying? HA: ""Even if I stir-fry them, it's no use. I absolutely won't eat things like bean sprouts or cabbage."" GV: ""You seem to be having a hard time. How about some vegetable juice?"" HA: I haven't tried vegetable juice yet, so I'll give it a shot! But if there's any left, it will be hell. GV: I hope it goes well. HA: That's right! Do you have any likes or dislikes? GV: Basically, there has been almost none since childhood! HA: That must have been a relief for your mother. GV: ""Actually, my mother also said something like that."" HA: ""Right! Do you eat a lot?"" GV: ""I used to eat quite a bit before. Recently, I have been consciously trying to reduce my intake a little for the sake of my diet."" HA: I see. How much could you eat with a bowl back in the day? GV: I used to eat about three servings before. Recently, I've been trying to keep it to one serving as much as possible. HA: Wow, amazing! Since I had sisters, the existence of such a world is refreshing. GV: I am surprised that the people in the sports club were eating much more. HA: I see! Are you careful about anything when you eat now? GV: I'm reducing carbohydrates and consciously increasing protein! HA: I see, when you say protein, what are you eating? GV: Like the salad chicken from breakfast earlier, I am eating a bit more meat. HA: ""Meat, huh! So meat is okay even on a diet."" GV: I am careful not to eat too much of the fatty parts. HA: It seems that meat with less fat would be good."
10,"GV: Hello. Nice to meet you. HA: The pleasure is mine. GV: What field did you major in at university? HA: I am a theater major. GV: I see! Did you study that field because you liked theater? HA: That's right. But it's something within the Faculty of Letters. GV: ""Did you also enjoy watching various things besides Takarazuka?"" HA: Yes, I often watched dancing! GV: What genre is it? HA: ""For example, ballet or contemporary dance. Are you familiar with contemporary?"" GV: I have heard of it! HA: I see! It's a style that doesn't appeal to everyone, so it's a bit hard to recommend. GV: I remember there were dancers doing that kind of thing at the Kohaku Uta Gassen. I don't dislike it! HA: ""Is it like Nogizaka48? Are you a backup dancer?"" GV: I don't remember which artist. HA: Is that so! Do you also know about Swan Lake? GV: I know the piece! Was it originally a ballet work? HA: Yes! Did you know that there is a male version of it? GV: I didn't know. HA: ""The swans are also men, and they dance a duet with only men. That kind of work aligns with recent trends!"" GV: If I get the chance, I'd like to appreciate things like that too! Once I get a job, I won't have much time. HA: That's right! But recently, due to COVID-19, there have been fewer performances in Japan, which is really disappointing. GV: Crossing borders is still difficult now, isn't it? HA: That's right. But recently, was the inspection lifted? GV: I feel like I've heard that kind of news too! HA: That's right. I would be happy if various things increase from now on. GV: The performers must have been struggling a lot since the start of COVID. HA: It is quite common for performances in Japan to be canceled. GV: I hope everything gets back to normal soon. HA: That's right. I feel suffocated and it's unbearable."
