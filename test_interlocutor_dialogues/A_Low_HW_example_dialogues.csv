1,"HW: Hello! CA: Hello! HW: It's hot again today, isn't it? CA: It's really hot, isn't it? HW: ""It's hot, isn't it? Eating something cold is a relief."" CA: Sounds good! I'll eat a lot of ice cream. HW: ""Ice cream is delicious, isn't it? What flavor of ice cream do you like?"" CA: ""Maybe vanilla~ How about you, Sukiyaki Cat?"" HW: I love matcha flavor! I always have matcha-flavored PALM in the refrigerator. CA: Wow! Matcha ice cream is great! HW: Yes! I like anything with matcha flavor. CA: I haven't tried the matcha flavor of Palmo yet, so listening to this made me want to eat it. HW: It's delicious, so I recommend it! The chocolate coating on the outside is thick and satisfying. CA: I'll try eating it the next time I buy ice cream! HW: Please try it! CA: Speaking of ice, I went to eat shaved ice the other day and found an interesting one. HW: What kind of shaved ice is it? I'm curious. CA: It's tiramisu shaved ice. HW: Wow! That looks delicious!! CA: Before eating it, I wondered what it would be like, but after tasting it, it really had a solid tiramisu flavor. HW: That's interesting! What did the shaved ice look like? CA: It felt like there was cream on top, and cocoa sprinkled over it. HW: At first glance, it looks Western! It seems like it would look great on Instagram and is lovely. CA: It seems that customers come from outside the prefecture as well. HW: ""It has become a specialty, hasn't it? I would like to try it once."" CA: I thought shaved ice was the same everywhere, but when I went and saw it, I understood why people line up. HW: Delicious things do indeed gain a reputation! CA: It will be. HW: I will look up tiramisu shaved ice next time! Thank you very much. CA: Absolutely! Thank you very much!"
2,"HW: Hello! CA: Hello! HW: Do you usually sleep on a bed or a futon? CA: I'm a futon person. How about you, <HW>? HW: Recently, I switched from a bed to a bunk bed! CA: Oh, nice! Why a bunk bed? HW: My room is too small, so I bought a bunk bed that was on sale. CA: I see! That's a clever way to use it! HW: The bunk bed has storage underneath, so my room feels more spacious now! CA: I'd love to learn more interior tips from you, <HW>! HW: The advantage of beds and futons is that you can roll out of them easily. CA: The rolling-out technique is the best! HW: Exactly! With bunk beds or loft beds, you have to climb down every time, which is a hassle. CA: That does add extra steps, doesn't it? HW: If I had a futon or a regular bed, I wouldn't have been late so many times... CA: Hahaha, you were just a few seconds away, huh? HW: Exactly. Last night was a tropical night, and it was so hot near the ceiling. CA: Oh right... Hot air rises. That must have been tough. HW: Lately, the temperature doesn't drop even at night, right? CA: Absolutely. It's impossible without air conditioning. HW: Yes. I feel like air conditioning works better with futons or beds. Do you use air conditioning at night? CA: I use it at night too. Even with the window open, it's still too hot. How about you, <HW>? HW: I use it every night. But my bed is right under the air conditioner, so the cold air hits me directly. CA: Wow, that's cool but also sounds uncomfortable in another way. HW: Exactly. If I don't use it, it gets too hot, but if I turn it on, the cold air hits me directly. CA: How about sleeping on the lower bunk? HW: I'd like to, but the lower bunk is full of stuff, so I just wrap myself in a futon with the air conditioner on. CA: Having stuff on the top bunk makes it unstable, right? HW: I see! I hadn't thought of putting stuff on the top. Thanks for the great advice! CA: I hope you can sleep well. Let's talk again! HW: Yes, let's talk again soon!"
3,"HW: Hello! CA: Hello! HW: What is your favorite food? CA: It's ramen! I like going to different places to eat. How about you, <HW>? HW: Ramen sounds good! I like sushi. What flavor of ramen do you like? CA: I like soy sauce the most. Sushi is good too!!! HW: The soy sauce flavor is nice! I like hard thin noodles with a salt flavor. Sushi is delicious too, isn't it? CA: Do you have any favorite stores here? HW: I forgot how to write the kanji, but the shio ramen at the restaurant called Afuri is delicious. CA: I want to go! Isn't it a shop in Kanagawa? HW: It's probably available nationwide, so I think it exists in Kanagawa as well! CA: It's a nationwide chain store, isn't it? Then there might be one nearby! I'll try to find it! HW: Yes! It's a recommended shop! As for commercially available salt ramen, I recommend Raoh's yuzu salt flavor. CA: I just found out that Raoh has a yuzu salt flavor! I'm going to get it at the store! HW: In the winter season, it is only sold during the hot pot season, so it might not be available in the summer. CA: It was a limited-time offer, wasn't it? Indeed, yuzu is a winter fruit. HW: Yes, that's right. I think it would be great if they sold it all year round because it's so delicious. CA: I'm starting to crave shio ramen. HW: Shio ramen is light and delicious, isn't it? It's hard to give up soy sauce ramen as well. CA: If it weren't for the COVID-19 pandemic, I would like to visit various ramen shops in Japan. HW: I think so too! I'd like to visit the top ramen shops in the national ranking someday. CA: Wow! That's great! HW: It seems that every store has a huge line, so it looks like it will take a lot of time, which is a concern. CA: ""The top-ranked shops are in places like Tokyo, right?"" HW: It seems they are scattered across various prefectures. It looks like many of the owners are master types, and they apparently only have a Tokyo branch in Tokyo. CA: So Tokyo is actually a branch, huh? It's about the ramen, but I also kind of want to see what the master is like. HW: ""The photo is also published in the ramen magazine, and it was also on the package of the collaboration ramen at the convenience store."" CA: I see! The boss can check that kind of thing too. HW: Recently, it has become a convenient world where collaboration products with famous ramen shops are easy to get. CA: Certainly, we live in a wonderful world. Let's talk again soon! HW: Yes, let's talk again!"
4,"HW: Hello CA: Hello HW: What is your favorite drink? CA: I love coffee. As for alcohol, I like shochu and sake. How about you, <HW>? HW: I like non-caffeinated tea. I don't usually drink alcohol. CA: ""Black tea is also nice. And I'm very interested in non-caffeine!"" HW: When it comes to non-caffeinated drinks, I often have decaf coffee, rooibos tea, or herbal teas. CA: I heard that too much caffeine is not good, so lately I've been thinking about cutting back on caffeine. HW: I also have a weak stomach, so I try to limit my caffeine intake. Do you have any recommended ways to drink coffee? CA: I usually drink instant black coffee, but I recently found a new favorite way to enjoy it. HW: I'm curious! Can you tell me? CA: I still like my coffee black, but I pair it with white chocolate. HW: I see! It looks delicious! CA: With sweetness, a milky taste, and white chocolate, it's enjoyable, so I recommend it. HW: I see! White chocolate seems to be less of a burden on the stomach, that's nice! I'll try drinking it next time. CA: However, caffeine really affects the stomach, doesn't it? HW: Yes, that's right. When I wake up in the morning and drink coffee on an empty stomach, my stomach hurts a lot. But if it's a warm drink, it's comfortable. CA: ""My body is telling me."" HW: I think maybe only my stomach is bad. Hahaha. Decaf apparently means non-caffeine. CA: Decaf and non-caffeine had the same meaning! HW: I remember that for sure. Non-caffeine is popular among pregnant women, people with insomnia, and people like me with weak stomachs. CA: ""It's good for everyone."" HW: ""It's good for your health and delicious, so I like it!"" CA: Speaking of which, this might be a change of subject, but by any chance, do you have a cat? HW: I have a cat allergy, so I can't keep a cat, but I love watching cat videos. CA: Oh, I see! The Slack icon was a cute cat, so it was soothing. HW: Cats are soothing, aren't they? I especially think cats with pink noses or wearing white socks are cute. CA: Just imagining it is healing. HW: The Mochineko channel on Youtube is recommended. Thank you very much! Let's talk again! CA: ""Is it Mochineko, Mochi-sama!? I love it too! Let's talk again!"""
5,"HW: Thank you in advance. EU: Nice to meet you, please take care of me! HW: ""It's a perfect day for sports, isn't it? Do you have any sports you're good at?"" EU: Actually, I'm clumsy with sports, but I like swimming. How about you? HW: ""Swimming, huh! Today is perfect for swimming! I play tennis as a hobby."" EU: Tennis is cool! It's the sport they call the gentleman's game. HW: Yes, that's right. Skilled people have a gentlemanly form. EU: ""It seems too hot to handle in the summer, you might collapse. And it involves hard movements."" HW: It's the kind of temperature today that makes you want to swim in the sea rather than play tennis. Have you gone swimming this year? EU: About the only thing I did was go to the local public pool with my child. Originally, we had planned to go to the river today. HW: The public pool looks fun! I'm jealous. EU: Because of the coronavirus situation, it wasn't too crowded, so that was good. HW: It's great that it wasn't crowded! I like the cool feeling of a private pool. EU: A private pool, how enviable!! HW: When I was a child, there was a time when I arrived at the public pool first thing in the morning and it was almost like having it all to myself. It left an impression on me because it felt different from usual. EU: Wow! Does ""first thing in the morning"" mean around 8 o'clock? HW: I think it was probably about that time. After that, I swam with a friend and ate ice cream. Don't you think there are a lot of ice cream vending machines at the public pool? EU: Oh yes, there's an ice cream vending machine! Cup noodles and such are also really delicious at that time! HW: You get hungry after swimming, don't you? EU: Everything I eat is really delicious. Ah, I'm starting to feel like swimming. I'm sorry for talking only about myself. HW: I like listening to people, so it's okay! EU: You're so kind. Next time, I'd love to hear more about tennis. HW: If it's about unusual tennis plays, I can always talk about them!! EU: Rare play! I imagined something like a comic on my own and couldn't help but laugh. HW: I'm having a good time with my tennis club friends. Could it make for an essay comic? Hahaha. EU: You're in a club! How serious! Could it be that you're an expert?? HW: ""This is a beginner's tennis club that often makes funny mistakes. Let's talk again sometime soon!"" EU: I also want to join in. Please let me talk with you again! HW: Yes! Thank you very much! EU: Thank you very much!!"
6,"HW: Thank you in advance! IM: Thank you in advance. HW: It's almost dinnertime! IM: Sure, has the menu been decided yet? HW: This is a regular menu item, but we plan to buy a paella kit from the supermarket and make it together as a family. IM: Paella! Sounds good, I love seafood dishes too. HW: It is very useful because it can be quickly made with just frozen seafood mix and paella seasoning. IM: That's nice, since I'm not good at cooking, the only thing I can make with seafood mix is pasta. HW: The seafood pasta looks delicious! May I ask what you have planned for dinner tonight? IM: I am planning to eat the leftover curry from yesterday. HW: Sounds great! Curry gets more delicious as the days go by, doesn't it? IM: It is said that curry tastes better on the second day, doesn't it? However, after hearing the conversation, I thought seafood curry might be nice too. HW: That's good to hear! I'll make seafood curry next time I cook curry! IM: I have never made it before, so honestly, I am a bit anxious. HW: I think it will probably go well! I think you just need to mix in the frozen seafood mix at the end! Probably! IM: That's right, I'll do my best! Do you cook often? HW: I cook every day, but I can only make the usual dishes with the ingredients I have. IM: It's amazing that you can make a staple dish with what you have on hand! HW: I only cook when necessary and don't have the leisure to enjoy it. Sigh. Do you cook or bake? IM: Actually, I'm not good at cooking and haven't done it much, but I do have a desire to try making it! HW: Sounds good! I also have some extra bananas at home, so I want to make a banana dessert when I have time. IM: Banana sweets! They look delicious! Do you have any recommended banana sweets? HW: I would like to try making banana bread by just mixing bananas and pancake mix and baking it. IM: It looks very delicious! And since it seems simple, I think I can make it too! HW: Yes, yes! It looks simple and delicious, doesn't it? I think I'll make it again when the price of butter goes down. IM: The price of butter! I had no idea, but is butter expensive now? HW: Due to the high cost of living, the prices of ingredients for making sweets are generally high. Sigh. It's sometimes cheaper to buy the finished products. IM: Well, then, I'll buy the finished product until it gets cheaper. HW: I will do that too! Haha. Let's talk again! IM: ""Please do it again."""
7,"HW: Thank you in advance. IM: Thank you in advance. HW: I'm watching anime right now, do you have any recommended anime or manga? IM: ""I'm getting hooked on Demon Slayer now!"" HW: ""Demon Slayer is interesting, isn't it! Did you watch the anime or read the manga?"" IM: I watched both! I started with the anime. HW: ""It's amazing that you watched both! Didn't it take a lot of time? I've only watched the anime!"" IM: It took a lot of time. But I got hooked on watching anime, so I have no regrets! HW: ""You're really into it, aren't you! The animation version was particularly beautiful, wasn't it?"" IM: That's right! I was also drawn in by the beautiful visuals and then captivated by the content. Do you watch anime often? HW: ""The content is well-crafted and interesting, isn't it? I understand. Do you have a favorite character?"" IM: Tanjiro is my favorite. Because of that, I've been watching videos on Hanae-san's YouTube channel. HW: Hanae-san has a nice voice and an interesting personality! I'll check out their YouTube channel next time! IM: My parent and I got hooked on it. However, we are currently busy and can't watch anime or YouTube. HW: ""Unlike the radio, watching videos requires a considerable amount of time, doesn't it? I understand."" IM: That's right, if I'm going to watch, I want to do it calmly. Do you watch anime often? HW: I tend to binge-watch when I have time! IM: Sounds good, I also watch about two seasons when I have the time. HW: Binge-watching is fun, isn't it! Do you eat anything while watching anime? IM: I will eat it! Potato chips are a necessity! HW: Potato chips are nice! What flavor do you like? IM: I often eat lightly salted, but if there's a limited edition, I'll buy that. HW: There are many varieties like premium potato chips and limited-time flavors, aren't there? I recently had thick-cut ridged potato chips, and they were delicious. IM: I have a weakness for limited-time offers. The thick-cut potato chips look delicious! I'll try buying them next time. But the downside of potato chips is that they make your hands dirty. HW: That's right. When you're eating, you can't do other tasks. IM: That's right, the other day I accidentally touched my smartphone and it turned into a big problem. HW: That must have been tough! IM: Since then, we have placed wet tissues all over our house. HW: That's a good habit! I was able to hear a nice story. Thank you very much. IM: Thank you very much as well."
8,"HW: Thank you in advance. IM: Thank you in advance. HW: It's hot every day, isn't it? IM: It's really hot, isn't it? Are you doing anything to cope with the heat? HW: I've been curious about the recently popular cool rings, but I've bought and been using a cool towel that gets chilly when moistened with water. IM: I also use a cool towel, but what exactly is a cool ring? HW: The cooling ring is made of a special material that freezes below 28°C, and it seems it won't wet your clothes. IM: Is there such a thing! It sounds great to not have your clothes get wet! HW: That's right! Cool towels were inconvenient because the neck area would get wet, but cool rings don't have that issue, so I think they're convenient. IM: My current concerns are that my clothes get wet and my luggage gets bulky with drinks. HW: ""In the summer, you end up carrying a lot of stuff, right? I understand!"" IM: When I go out, I usually travel by train, but having a lot of luggage is really troublesome. HW: It would be nice if the luggage could be compact. But I think it's nice to be able to carry your favorite drink in a water bottle. IM: But now there are so many different kinds of drinks that it's hard to choose, right? Do you have any recommendations for drinks? HW: I drink it with jasmine tea or flavored tea powder. It's a taste that people either love or hate, so I'm not sure if you'll like it. IM: Jasmine is also something I like and often drink! But this is the first time I've heard of flavored tea powder! HW: At the supermarket, there was a powder type of tea flavored with apple and vanilla that you dissolve in water and drink. IM: That's convenient! I used to drink a lot of tea and coffee, but I eventually settled on water. HW: They say water is good for your health. Do you have any preferences for hard or soft water? IM: ""I'm not very particular, but I find hard water unpleasant to drink and don't drink it much."" HW: Hard water is said to be unsuitable for making tea, and its mouthfeel is different, making it a bit inconvenient to use, right? IM: That's right. But my mother at home preferred hard water, so there were two types of water in the refrigerator. HW: It's wonderful! I feel like people who drink hard water pay attention to their beauty, and I admire that a bit! IM: Indeed, I admire it! I think they also said that hard water is suitable for cooking. HW: Wow! I didn't know that. Water is quite profound, isn't it? IM: I'm not very knowledgeable about cooking, so I'm not sure, but it seems that the way water is used varies depending on the type. HW: I was using it normally without knowing anything, but I think I'll do a little research! IM: ""That being said, I don't really understand it well either. But since it's a good opportunity, I'll look into it too."" HW: I had a great conversation! Thank you very much. IM: Thank you very much as well!"
9,"HW: Thank you in advance! IM: Thank you in advance! HW: Do you like animals? IM: Yes, I like them so much that I even have pets at home! HW: What kind of animal do you have? IM: I have a cat at home! It’s a stray cat, so it doesn’t have a pedigree, but it’s just so cute and soothing. HW: Do you have a cat? I'm so jealous. What color is your cat? IM: It's a milk tea color! Are pets not allowed? HW: I have a cat allergy, so although I like cats, I can't keep one. IM: I see, that must be tough. HW: ""I limit myself to just watching cats on TV shows. Living with a cat looks like fun, doesn't it?"" IM: It's fun, but taking care of living creatures can be challenging. HW: May I ask what kind of things are difficult, for example? IM: There are various difficulties, but the biggest one is not being able to travel, I suppose. HW: I see! It seems that there are water dispensers and automatic feeders these days, but is traveling still difficult even with those? IM: ""What, there is something that convenient! I didn't know."" HW: I saw it on sale on Amazon the other day. The world has become a convenient place, hasn't it? IM: If I have that, I might be able to go on a trip. I didn't know because I haven't used Amazon much. HW: I haven't used it either, so I'm not sure about the details, but it might be convenient to have. Is your cat already big? IM: He is older in age and also quite a large, chubby cat. HW: ""Big cats are wonderful too. I've seen a cat that stretches a lot on TV. They have a different kind of cuteness compared to kittens."" IM: That's right, kittens are cute, but the feeling of holding a big cat is completely different. HW: That's wonderful! Life with a cat seems fun!! IM: These days, you can even watch it on YouTube, so even people who can't keep pets can enjoy it. Do you watch YouTube or anything like that? HW: Sometimes, I watch cat videos. There are also various cat toys. IM: ""There are lots of cat toys, aren't there? But they get bored with them quickly, don't they?"" HW: That's a problem. IM: ""Therefore, we have a large amount of unused toys in our house. This is also one of the difficult things."" HW: Thank you for the enjoyable conversation! Let's talk again! IM: ""Please do it again."""
10,"HW: Thank you in advance. IM: Thank you in advance. HW: It's hot every day, isn't it? IM: ""It's hot, isn't it? But I like summer, so it's fun!"" HW: You like summer, don't you! Why is summer your favorite season? IM: ""Is it because it's fun no matter where you go! The sea is fun, and the mountains are fun too!"" HW: Sure! Here is the translated sentence: ""Indeed! I also love seeing the mountains lush and green in summer! I love how it looks like a picture with the cumulonimbus clouds."" IM: Certainly, the sky is also nice in the summer! It looks picturesque, doesn't it! HW: I like to travel to summer resorts and mountains, but I haven't been able to go recently. Have you been on any trips lately? IM: This year, although I haven't done it yet, I'm planning to return to my hometown for Obon! HW: That sounds exciting! Is your hometown in the mountains? Or by the sea? IM: My hometown has a lot of mountains! HW: I see! Living near the mountains is lovely, isn't it? IM: It's nice, isn't it? I want to go back to my hometown and live in the future. Do you have any plans to go somewhere this summer? HW: I was also planning to travel a bit during Obon, but as the COVID-19 infection situation is increasing, I am currently waiting to see how things develop. IM: It's increasing again. It's a bit disappointing that we can't go out even though it's summer. HW: That's right. A lot has changed since the spread of COVID-19 compared to before. IM: Things have changed, haven't they? I had a recital for my lessons, but it got canceled this year as well. HW: That's a shame. What kind of lessons are you taking? IM: I have been playing the piano since I was a student. HW: That's wonderful! How many years have you been doing it? IM: I have been continuing for nearly 10 years! I have been working hard with the annual recital as my goal, so it is very disappointing that it has been canceled. HW: You've been continuing for 10 years! It's great to have goals every year. IM: Thank you very much. Is there anything you are continuing to do? HW: ""Sometimes I attend cooking classes. I've been slacking off quite a bit though. Oh dear."" IM: ""It's wonderful that you're attending cooking classes! How long have you been going?"" HW: Rather than continuing to attend regularly, I just go occasionally when I remember. IM: I see. I can't cook, so people who can are amazing. HW: Thank you very much. Let's talk again if we have the chance! IM: Thank you very much!"
