1,"AH: Hello! AI: Hello! AH: Have you already had lunch? AI: Yes, we ate out today. AH: Eating out is relaxing and nice, isn't it! AI: I drank quite a lot of alcohol at noon. AH: ""Drinking alcohol from noon? That sounds fun!"" AI: ""A little beer, just enough to enjoy."" AH: I thought you were drinking a lot. AI: Hehe, well, maybe it's not just a little. AH: Do you drink alcohol quite often? AI: I drink about as much as an average person. AH: I see. I want to try drinking it someday too. AI: Ah, are you the type who doesn't drink at all? AH: Yes, I don't really feel like drinking. AI: If you can get by without drinking, it might be better not to drink. AH: I don't know if it's a substitute, but I often drink carbonated water. AI: ""Oh, I drink Wilkinson a lot."" AH: There are also carbonated alcoholic beverages, right? AI: ""Wait a minute, Wilkinson is carbonated water."" AH: ""Is that so? Because alcohol came up."" AI: Moreover, everyone mistakenly thinks that Wilkinson is an imported product. AH: The name sounds foreign, doesn't it? AI: ""A genuine domestic product, a domestic product with history."" AH: It seems to have a history of over 100 years. AI: Indeed, it is true that the one who discovered it was British. AH: I see, that's news to me! AI: Mr. Wilkinson found it. AH: That's why it had a foreign-sounding name! AI: Moreover, it is also true that the main purpose is for highballs."
2,"AH: Hello! AI: Hello! AH: Did you do anything over the weekend? AI: ""I haven't done much, but if I had to say, I practiced the piano."" AH: You can play the piano, right? How long have you been playing? AI: I resumed as an adult, and it's already been several years. AH: ""You can continue for several years!"" AI: Including from when I was a child, it might be several decades already. AH: I'm jealous that you can keep it up for so long! AI: Well, sometimes I think, considering the amount of time I'm spending on it... AH: I think it's amazing just to be able to continue. AI: Did anything happen over the weekend? AH: I may be tired because I had several nightmares. AI: ""Is it a nightmare? What kind of nightmare, if you don't mind?"" AH: I had a dream where I made a pretty big mistake at work. AI: That's a bad dream. AH: Yes, I was quite relieved because it was just a dream. AI: How should I put it, I feel like I hate myself for thinking about work even in my dreams. AH: Yes, I wanted to have a slightly more enjoyable dream. AI: ""When I was young, I often dreamt about work too."" AH: Oh, I see! AI: I haven't seen it at all recently. AH: If I continue for a few years, will I stop seeing it? AI: Another name for it is that I have become a respectable, rotten adult. AH: If possible, I want to live a decent life. AI: ""Huh, do you have a conscious awareness that it's not normal?"" AH: Yes, I often make frequent mistakes in real life too. AI: Everyone makes mistakes; the important thing is how you recover from them. AH: That's right, at least the spinach is properly taken care of. AI: The skill to turn mistakes into opportunities, in a way, might be considered an adult technique."
3,"AH: Hello! AI: Hello AH: Will you have dinner? AI: Yes, I will prepare in a little while. AH: By the way, may I ask about the menu? AI: Since there is steak left, that will definitely be the main dish. AH: I want to eat steak too! AI: Steak is good, especially lean meat. AH: Yes, I also like lean meat! AI: Domestic greasy ones are also delicious in their own way. AH: I want to bite into the redness with all my might. AI: Since becoming a muscle training enthusiast, I've been somewhat afraid of fat. AH: It looks like I might gain weight. AI: Why would you go out of your way to coat such good quality protein with oil? AH: The oil is delicious, but I can't eat a lot of it after all. AI: I also started to avoid things like french fries from some time ago. AH: ""That also seems to have a lot of calories, doesn't it?"" AI: A decade ago, steak was usually served with French fries. AH: ""The potatoes on the side are delicious."" AI: The garnish is now rapeseed blossoms. AH: Canola flowers, they're rare, aren't they? AI: It pairs well with butter, so it's perfect next to steak. AH: ""Don't you add things like carrots?"" AI: Carrots are good too, aren't they? AH: At our place, we often serve things like carrots on the side. AI: Speaking of carrots, I love soup. AH: The carrot soup looks delicious. AI: ""Boiling, adding milk, and making a smoothie is the best."" AH: I just learned about carrot smoothies for the first time! AI: Oh, please definitely try it. It's really delicious and good for nutrition."
4,"AH: Good evening! AI: Good evening AH: ""Do you have any special skills?"" AI: ""My special skill is, let's see, that I have the unique ability to find the cuisine of any country I visit to be the most delicious."" AH: The skill to enjoy cooking seems to be quite useful! AI: They might be very curious. AH: Have you been to places like the UK for travel? AI: I went to the UK, including Stonehenge and so on. AH: I heard that British cuisine is amazing. AI: ""Oh, that's self-deprecating humor."" AH: Is that so? AI: Yes, they themselves are actually confident about it. AH: I've never eaten it, so I want to try it someday. AI: ""For now, let's start with fish and chips."" AH: That looks relatively easy to eat. AI: If you like beer, this is the best food. AH: It goes well with beer, doesn't it? AI: ""Edamame or fish and chips, that is the question."" AH: I'm likely to get quite lost. AI: All that's left is the roast beef. AH: ""Was roast beef also from England?"" AI: Yes, the roast beef is pretty good. AH: It doesn't seem like British cuisine, it's surprising. AI: To begin with, there's even a term called English Breakfast. AH: English breakfast? AI: Yes, it means they are more particular about it than the continent. AH: Oh, I'd definitely like to try that! AI: If you go to France, more than just croissants and caf√© au lait. AH: There are quite a few nearby, aren't there? AI: However, the French way is to put their heart and soul into those croissants."
5,"AH: Hello! AQ: Hello. AH: It was quite hot today. AQ: It's hot, isn't it? Are you staying inside the house all the time? AH: I was outside in the morning. AQ: Are you shopping? AH: No, it's a walk. AQ: You're great for taking a walk! AH: I haven't been exercising much lately. AQ: Me too. AH: I thought that walking is something I can do myself, so I am doing it. AQ: ""That's amazing. It's outside, right?"" AH: Yes, it's outside! AQ: I might get drenched in sweat. AH: Yes, I was sweating a lot halfway through. AQ: ""That's right. But it's better in the morning, isn't it?"" AH: Yes, it seems it will get even hotter in the afternoon. AQ: I can't walk in the afternoon. AH: Yes, I want to stay at home from the afternoon. AQ: Yeah, but I've been staying at home all day recently. AH: It looks comfortable and I'm jealous. AQ: ""Work was remote until last month."" AH: It seems convenient to work remotely because you don't have to go out. AQ: Once you get used to working remotely, you won't be able to go out to work. AH: Certainly, since the habit of going outside has been interrupted. AQ: That's right. It's so comfortable that I can't break free. AH: I would also like to try remote work. AQ: Please try it if you get the chance. AH: Yes, I would like to consider that kind of job as well. AQ: Let's talk again."
6,"AH: Hello! AQ: Hello. AH: Which season do you like? AQ: It's summer. AH: Is it summer? It feels kind of unusual. AQ: Is that so? Aren't there a lot of fireworks and events? AH: I see, there were indeed things like fireworks displays and summer festivals. AQ: ""That's right. I hate the heat, but I like sweating, which is a contradiction."" AH: ""Do you exercise?"" AQ: Right now, not at all, but I like exercising. AH: I respect people who can exercise. AQ: Is that so? Don't you exercise? AH: I am not good at intense exercise. AQ: I wonder if they're not good at volleyball. AH: I was not good at things that involved using a ball. AQ: Hmm, I see. It's difficult, isn't it? AH: Yes, it was difficult to throw the ball to the intended position. AQ: ""It's difficult. Did you have marathon competitions during your student days?"" AH: I found it! AQ: ""For people who are not good at that, it's hell, isn't it?"" AH: Yes, the practice was quite difficult. AQ: I feel like I was made to run quite a distance. AH: I feel like it was about one kilometer from my place. AQ: Huh? Was it only that much? AH: It might be different depending on the school. AQ: That's right. I think it was 10 km during high school. AH: It looks like it will take about an hour. AQ: ""That's right. It's already hell."" AH: If I don't stay hydrated, it feels like I might collapse. AQ: That's really true. Thank you very much."
7,"AH: Hello! AQ: Hello. AH: Do you like animals? AQ: I like you. AH: I see. By the way, do you have any favorite animals? AQ: Is it a dog? AH: Is it a small dog or a large dog? AQ: I like dachshunds. AH: So tiny and cute! AQ: That's right. It's cute, isn't it? AH: ""Are they being kept?"" AQ: I don't have that pet. AH: ""Taking care of a pet seems tough."" AQ: That's right. Do you have any pets? AH: I have a goldfish. AQ: Oh, how cute. AH: You've grown a lot! AQ: Is it the one with the goldfish scooping? AH: Yes, that's the one I brought back. AQ: ""Oh, that is proof that you are taking good care of it."" AH: We've been together for about four years now. AQ: That is excellent. AH: Is that so? AQ: Yes. The goldfish in goldfish scooping are weak. AH: I have heard such a story. AQ: They usually weaken right away. AH: Certainly, the day after I scooped them up, one had died. AQ: That's right. I hope the goldfish stays healthy from now on too. AH: Yes, if possible, I want to be together forever! AQ: Ahaha! Well, I must be going."
8,"AH: Hello! AQ: Hello. AH: Do you eat breakfast? AQ: I will eat. AH: Could you please tell me what kind of menu it is? AQ: Mostly, it's usually white rice with natto. AH: Natto rice is simple and delicious, isn't it! AQ: That's right. Sometimes I also add raw eggs. AH: Raw egg, natto, and rice seem to have great compatibility! AQ: It's delicious. Can you eat natto? AH: Yes, I eat it every night. AQ: That is wonderful. AH: It seems to be good for your health, too. AQ: Yes, it seems that this is the number one food recommended by doctors. AH: It was good enough that the doctor recommended it. AQ: It looks like it. They said it on the news. AH: I didn't think it was that good. AQ: Yeah, yeah. They say it also relates to lifespan. AH: They say fermented foods are good for the body. AQ: In short, that's what it is. AH: I think the first person who ate it is amazing. AQ: That's certainly true. AH: If there is something rotten, I will throw it away. AQ: Certainly. That sticky stuff. AH: I also think the person who came up with that sauce is a genius. AQ: Got it! I like that. Rice with raw egg and natto. AH: I also love that sauce! AQ: Did you understand? Good. AH: Yes, I never thought there would be anyone else who felt the same way. AQ: Hahaha. Let's talk again."
9,"AH: Good evening! BI: Good evening! AH: Have you eaten lunch yet? BI: Yes! I ate KFC today. AH: Kentucky is delicious, isn't it! BI: That's right! I cut corners. AH: How much did you eat? BI: One burger and fries. AH: ""Does Kentucky have burgers?"" BI: Yes. Right now, there's a seasonal spicy one available. AH: I see. It seems that spicy food is quite spicy. BI: When I tried it, it wasn't that great, but it was delicious! AH: Is it something like spicy and tasty? It looks delicious. BI: That's right! By the way, I'm having chicken for dinner. AH: It's all Kentucky, isn't it! BI: ""Once I go, I want to eat various things!"" AH: Everything looks delicious, it's hard to choose. BI: That's right. Since I couldn't decide, I bought for two times. AH: It's enviable that you can eat two meals. BI: ""Day and night, I'm slacking off, though."" AH: I think it's fine as long as it's delicious, even if it's a shortcut. BI: Have you decided on dinner? AH: I have not decided yet. BI: What is it usually like? AH: I ate mapo tofu yesterday. BI: ""Mapo tofu, sounds great! Is it quite spicy?"" AH: I can't eat very spicy food, so just a little bit of spiciness is good for me. BI: I see! I tend to add spiciness. AH: Someday, I'd like to try eating something really spicy. BI: The most important thing is to enjoy eating deliciously!"
10,"AH: Good evening! BI: Good evening! AH: Which season do you like? BI: I like autumn! AH: Autumn is nice, isn't it? You can do various things like eating and exercising. BI: That's right. It's great that there are many delicious things! AH: What kind of things do you like? BI: Speaking of autumn, it's got to be Pacific saury! AH: ""It's a representative of autumn!"" BI: Yes. I look forward to eating it every year. AH: Sanma (Pacific saury) is cheap and delicious. BI: Recently, there are times when it becomes a bit more expensive, which is unfortunate. AH: Certainly, it seems that fish has been getting more expensive lately. BI: It feels like autumn has become shorter, and everything seems a bit strange. AH: Certainly, it feels like the period of comfortable weather has shortened. BI: Yes, because it's extremely hot, it will become extremely cold. AH: The temperature difference has become severe, hasn't it? BI: I feel like the climate is changing rapidly. AH: Could it be because of global warming? BI: The snow has decreased, hasn't it! AH: Certainly, it doesn't snow at all in the Kanto region. BI: Even in Tohoku, it has decreased considerably compared to the past. AH: I had an image that the Tohoku region is updating its record for highest snowfall. BI: In some areas where it rains heavily, that might be the case. AH: It felt different depending on the place. BI: I feel like the place where I used to live has decreased considerably. AH: Has it become better or worse as it has become more comfortable? BI: I'm glad that shoveling snow has become easier! AH: That was good! BI: Yes! Thank you very much."
