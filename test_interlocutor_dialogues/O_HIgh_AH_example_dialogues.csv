1,"AH: Hello! AQ: Hello. AH: It was quite hot today. AQ: It's hot, isn't it? Are you staying inside the house all the time? AH: I was outside in the morning. AQ: Are you shopping? AH: No, it's a walk. AQ: You're great for going on a walk! AH: I haven't been exercising much lately. AQ: Me too. AH: I thought I could manage walking by myself, so I am doing it. AQ: ""That's amazing. It's outside, right?"" AH: Yes, it's outside! AQ: It looks like I'm going to get drenched in sweat. AH: Yes, I was sweating a lot halfway through. AQ: That's right. But it's better in the morning, isn't it? AH: Yes, it seems it will get hotter in the afternoon. AQ: I can't walk from the afternoon. AH: Yes, I want to stay at home from the afternoon. AQ: Yes, yes, but recently I've been staying at home all day. AH: It looks comfortable and I'm envious. AQ: ""Work was also remote until last month."" AH: It seems convenient since you don't have to go out when working remotely. AQ: Once you get used to remote work, you won't be able to go out to work. AH: Certainly, the habit of going outside has been interrupted. AQ: That's right. It's so comfortable that I can't escape. AH: I would also like to try remote work. AQ: Please give it a try if you have the chance. AH: Yes, I would like to consider such a type of job as well. AQ: Let's talk again."
2,"AH: Hello! AQ: Hello. AH: Which season do you like? AQ: It is summer. AH: Is it summer? It feels kind of unusual. AQ: ""Is that so? There are a lot of fireworks and events, right?"" AH: I see, there were indeed fireworks festivals and summer festivals. AQ: That's right. I hate the heat, but I like sweating, such a contradiction. AH: Do you exercise? AQ: ""Not at all now, but I like exercising."" AH: I respect people who can exercise. AQ: Is that so? Don't you exercise? AH: I am not good at intense exercise. AQ: I wonder if they're not good at volleyball or something. AH: I was not good at things that use balls. AQ: Hmm. It's difficult, isn't it? AH: Yes, it was difficult to throw the ball to the intended position. AQ: ""It's difficult, isn't it? Did you have marathon events during your school days?"" AH: Found it! AQ: ""For people who are not good at that, it's like hell, isn't it?"" AH: Yes, the practice was quite tough. AQ: I feel like I was made to run quite a distance. AH: I think it was about one kilometer from my place. AQ: Huh? Was it just that much? AH: It might be different depending on the school. AQ: That's right. I think it was 10 km during high school. AH: It seems like it will take about an hour. AQ: ""That's right. It's already hell."" AH: It seems like I would collapse if I don't stay hydrated. AQ: That's really true. Thank you very much."
3,"AH: Hello! AQ: Hello. AH: Do you like animals? AQ: I like you. AH: I see. By the way, do you have a favorite animal? AQ: ""I wonder if it's a dog."" AH: ""Is it a small dog or a large dog?"" AQ: I like dachshunds. AH: So tiny and cute! AQ: That's right. It's cute, isn't it? AH: ""Are they being kept as pets?"" AQ: I don't have that as a pet. AH: Taking care of pets seems to be quite challenging, doesn't it? AQ: That's right. Do you have a pet? AH: I have a goldfish. AQ: Oh, how cute. AH: You've grown a lot! AQ: ""Is it the one where you caught goldfish?"" AH: Yes, that's the one I brought back. AQ: Oh, that is proof that you are taking good care of it. AH: We've been together for about four years now. AQ: It is excellent. AH: Is that so? AQ: Yes, because the goldfish from goldfish scooping are often weak. AH: I have heard such a story. AQ: ""They usually get weak quickly."" AH: Certainly, one of them had died the day after it was scooped. AQ: That's right. I hope the little goldfish continues to be healthy. AH: Yes, if possible, I would like to be with you forever! AQ: Hahaha! Well, excuse me."
4,"AH: Hello! AQ: Hello. AH: Do you eat breakfast? AQ: I'm going to eat! AH: Could you tell me what kind of menu it is? AQ: Most of the time, it's usually white rice with natto. AH: Natto rice is simple and delicious, isn't it! AQ: Yes, that's right. Sometimes I even add raw eggs. AH: Raw egg, natto, and rice seem like a great combination! AQ: It's delicious. Can you eat natto? AH: Yes, I eat it every night. AQ: That is wonderful. AH: It seems to be good for health too. AQ: Sure, here's the translation: ""Yes, it seems to be the number one food recommended by doctors."" AH: It was so good that even the doctor recommended it. AQ: ""It seems so. They said it on the news."" AH: I didn't think it was that good. AQ: Yeah, yeah. They say it also relates to lifespan. AH: They say fermented foods are good for you. AQ: In short, that's what it is. AH: I think the person who ate it first is amazing. AQ: That's certainly true. AH: If there are any rotten items, I will throw them away. AQ: Certainly. Such a slimy thing. AH: I also think the person who came up with that sauce made a great invention. AQ: Got it! I like that thing. Egg something natto. AH: I also love that sauce! AQ: Did you understand? Good. AH: Yes, I never thought there would be anyone else thinking the same thing. AQ: Haha. Let's talk again."
5,"AH: Good evening! BI: Good evening! AH: Have you already had lunch? BI: Yes! Today I ate KFC. AH: KFC is delicious, isn't it? BI: That's right! I cut corners. AH: How much did you eat? BI: One burger and fries. AH: ""Does Kentucky have burgers?"" BI: Yes, we currently have a limited-time spicy one. AH: I see. It seems quite tough to handle辛いもの. BI: When I tried it, it wasn't that great, but it was delicious! AH: Is it like spicy and delicious? It looks tasty. BI: That's right! By the way, I'll have chicken for dinner. AH: It's all about Kentucky! BI: Once you go, you want to try various foods! AH: They all look delicious, so it's hard to decide. BI: That's right. Since I couldn't decide, it's for two times. AH: It's enviable that you can eat two meals. BI: ""Day and night, I've been cutting corners."" AH: I think it's fine if it's delicious even with shortcuts. BI: Have you decided on dinner? AH: I haven't decided yet. BI: What is it usually like? AH: Yesterday, I ate mapo tofu. BI: ""Mapo tofu, that's nice! Is it quite spicy?"" AH: I can't eat very spicy food, so I prefer it mildly spicy. BI: I see! I tend to add spiciness. AH: Someday, I would like to try something really spicy. BI: The best thing is to be able to eat deliciously!"
6,"AH: Good evening! BI: Good evening! AH: Which of the four seasons do you like? BI: I like autumn! AH: Autumn is nice, isn't it? You can enjoy food, exercise, and various activities. BI: That's right. It's great that there are many delicious things! AH: What kind of things do you like? BI: Speaking of autumn, it has to be Pacific saury! AH: ""It's a symbol of autumn!"" BI: Yes. I look forward to eating it every year. AH: Pacific saury is cheap and delicious. BI: Recently, there are times when the price becomes a bit higher, and it's disappointing. AH: Certainly, it does seem like fish products have been expensive recently. BI: It feels like autumn has become shorter, and everything feels strange. AH: Certainly, it feels like the period of comfortable weather has gotten shorter. BI: Yes, because it's very hot, it will become very cold. AH: The temperature differences have become drastic, haven't they? BI: I feel like the climate is changing rapidly. AH: Is it because of global warming? BI: The snow has decreased, hasn't it? AH: Indeed, it doesn't snow at all in the Kanto region. BI: Even in the Tohoku region, it has decreased significantly compared to the past. AH: I had the impression that Tohoku was experiencing record snowfall. BI: In some parts, it might rain heavily. AH: It felt different depending on the location. BI: The place where I used to live seems to have decreased considerably. AH: Is it better or worse now that it has become more comfortable to spend time there? BI: I'm glad that shoveling snow has become easier! AH: That was good! BI: Yes! Thank you very much."
7,"AH: Good evening! AT: Good evening! AH: Have you already eaten dinner? AT: Yes, I ate mapo tofu. AH: I ate it yesterday too! AT: What a coincidence! AH: In the summer, I feel like eating spicy foods. AT: So, it makes you sweat. AH: Yes, it feels good to take a bath after that. AT: I see, do you like spicy food? AH: I can't eat things that are too spicy, but I like mildly spicy food. AT: Me too, I can only eat one or two bites if it's too spicy. AH: How should I alleviate the spiciness after eating something spicy? AT: I haven't done much other than roll cold drinks around on my tongue. AH: I heard that drinking water is counterproductive, so I was wondering what to do. AT: I will look into it next time! AH: That's right, I'll look it up too! AT: What did you have for dinner today? AH: Today I ate stir-fried vegetables. AT: I used to eat it often too. AH: I regularly feel like eating vegetables. AT: I think it's very good because it is nutritious! AH: It's easy to become deficient in vegetables. AT: How do you handle seasoning? AH: It's oil and salt and pepper! AT: I'm in too! AH: I like simple seasoning! AT: ""Even so, it's still delicious!"" AH: Yes, deliciousness is the best. AT: Let's consume a lot of nutrients and get through the summer!"
8,"AH: Good evening! AT: Good evening. AH: Which season do you like? AT: Actually, I like summer! AH: In the summer, there are festivals and it's a fun atmosphere. AT: There are many events outside, and the beer tastes delicious. AH: ""The benefit precisely because it's hot, isn't it?"" AT: There are many things like delicious ice cream, frequent holidays, waking up well, and more. AH: That's right, speaking of summer, it's definitely ice cream! AT: Do you like ice cream? AH: I love it! AT: What kind of ice cream do you like? AH: I like ice-based or refreshing things. AT: There are also things like polar bears, iceboxes, and sherbet types, right? AH: ""And then there's Garigari-kun and such."" AT: That sounds good, but it melts quickly when eaten outside. AH: That's right. So I try to eat at home as much as possible. AT: The watermelon ice bar makes you feel summer. AH: Speaking of summer, there's also watermelon. AT: ""You can really feel the seasons; I often buy ice cream by the box."" AH: Since you can eat a lot, a box is definitely the way to go! AT: The amount per dose is just right. AH: That's right. If you eat too much, your stomach will hurt. AT: I have a weak stomach, so I am careful about that as well. AH: That's right, we have to be careful about that. AT: I can't help but want to consume a lot of cold things, so I can't do without digestive medicine. AH: There is also the option of relying on medication. AT: ""Normally, it would be good to maintain gut health, but it doesn't seem to suit me."" AH: But the ice cream is delicious. AT: Let's be careful not to overeat!"
9,"AH: Hello! AL: Hello! AH: Do you have a favorite season? AL: I hate summer. AH: Summer is hot, isn't it? AL: I like autumn. AH: Autumn is comfortable, isn't it! AL: Traveling is fun, and the food is delicious. AH: After all, it's easier to spend time than summer. AL: ""Ahaha, summer makes it all the more appreciated."" AH: That's right. However, I feel that autumn has been short recently. AL: Is summer long? Is winter early? AH: Both, I suppose. AL: Do you like autumn the best? AH: I also like autumn! AL: Autumn, the season of appetite! AH: I want to eat various dishes when autumn comes. AL: Warm udon, perhaps? AH: That's nice too! AL: What else should we eat? AH: In the fall, saury also looks delicious. AL: Ah, I missed eating it last year. AH: What else is there? AL: I want to eat chestnuts. AH: Certainly, there were also chestnuts. AL: ""Even the limited edition autumn Haagen-Dazs is fine."" AH: There are some items that are only available in autumn, aren't there! AL: Potatoes or something? AH: I want to eat baked sweet potatoes! AL: Sounds good!"
10,"AH: Hello! AL: Hello! AH: Do you like animals? AL: Hehe, I like dogs! AH: Is it a large dog or a small dog? AL: Whether it's large or small, I like blue-faced ones! AH: It's cute, isn't it! AL: Both French Bulldogs and Pugs are cute! AH: You are quite knowledgeable. AL: When I was a child, I feel like I was always looking at dog encyclopedias. AH: ""There is such a thing as a dog encyclopedia!"" AL: ""Of course, there is also a cat encyclopedia. If it's a zoo, maybe a giraffe."" AH: I also liked giraffes! AL: ""Your tongue is surprisingly long, isn't it?"" AH: ""Is that so? It was so big that I couldn't see that far."" AL: There is a zoo called Sayuri World in Chiba. AH: Is it a big place? AL: ""Even though it's small, there are a lot of giraffes."" AH: It's true, when I searched, a lot of giraffe images came up. AL: You can feed the giraffes. AH: What do giraffes eat? AL: It was easier to feed them carrots, but it seemed like they preferred bananas. AH: ""Is it a banana? That's quite surprising."" AL: ""Is it because it's sweet? It was a zoo where the human position becomes weaker."" AH: I thought that giraffes have pretty cute faces too. AL: ""The pressure to give food is strong, with those innocent eyes."" AH: Because of that size, the pressure must be incredible. AL: The children's screams echoed. AH: It might have been a little scary. AL: Isn't it?"
