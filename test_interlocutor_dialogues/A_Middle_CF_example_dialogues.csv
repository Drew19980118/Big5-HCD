1,"CF: Good evening. The rain is intense, isn't it? How is it over there? BW: Good evening! It doesn't seem to be raining right now. CF: I see! It's raining heavily here right now. BW: I see, it does vary depending on the location after all. A typhoon is coming, right? CF: That's right. I was thinking of going to the convenience store, but I gave up. BW: I see, it doesn't look like it'll stop soon like a sudden shower. CF: It seems like it will rain harder than a sudden shower, but it is expected to be sunny tomorrow. BW: It will stop soon, I heard that Tohoku and Hokkaido might be in trouble. CF: It's Tokyo here, and it looks like the rain will stop by midnight. The convenience store might open in the morning. BW: I see, I hope it passes quickly. CF: ""Yes. I'm thinking of going out tomorrow."" BW: That makes it even more surprising, especially since it often rains suddenly even in summer recently. CF: Thunder often rumbles and strikes quite a bit, doesn't it? I'm worried about electrical appliances when it thunders. BW: ""Has it fallen? Yes, it seems like the electrical appliances are not working well."" CF: I am worried because on the day after a lightning strike in the past, the computers at my workplace stopped working. BW: ""Did that really happen? It would make it impossible to work. And there's no way to be careful about it either."" CF: That's right. The work that day was hopeless. BW: That must have been tough; I hope you get to go home. CF: I couldn't go home that day, but on another day when a typhoon came, I was told to go home, and I ended up going to see a movie. BW: Certainly, when a typhoon comes, we can go home early. Did you go to the movies? That's nice. CF: It was quite a while ago. There were only about three people, so it was comfortable! BW: The movie theater on weekdays looks comfortable! That's when I want to go to the movies. CF: You want to watch quietly, right? Do you often go to the movie theater? BW: Recently, I haven't been able to go at all, but I love watching movies in the theater. How about you? CF: I also like watching movies in the theater. I especially like the early morning or late night shows. BW: Ah, that's nice, it doesn't seem too crowded, so it looks like we can watch comfortably. CF: That's right. I'm going to watch Pokémon at the movie theater for the first time in a while, probably around the week after next. BW: ""Pokemon is on right now! Do you go during less crowded hours?"" CF: It seems there is a revival screening of old Pokémon, so I'm taking the kids. We'll go in the evening! BW: I see, please have a great time! CF: Thank you very much!"
2,"CF: Good evening! BW: Good evening, please take care of me! CF: ""Likewise, thank you. Are you going to visit the grave during Obon?"" BW: Yes, I plan to go on the 15th. Are you going? CF: I am not going. One reason is that many people around me have contracted COVID. BW: I see, I live in the neighborhood. CF: It's close and easy to get to. BW: That's right, it becomes difficult if you have to go on a long trip. CF: I heard that an acquaintance who had returned to their hometown also got COVID-19 today, and I thought that it is indeed spreading. BW: The fact that it’s widespread means that anyone can get the disease, right? CF: I see. This lifestyle has been going on for a long time, so I hope it ends soon. BW: It seems that only Japan is continuing, while abroad people seem to be living as if it never happened. CF: I'm a little envious. Are you interested in traveling abroad? BW: Yes, I like going abroad, so I want to visit various places. Do you like it too? CF: Actually, I don't have any experience abroad, but I want to go. BW: I've only been to China, but I've always dreamed about it. CF: Oh! China, huh. How is it? BW: ""It was quite a long time ago, but it was a bit different from Japan and interesting."" CF: I see. Since I love eating, I'm interested in the food situation. BW: If it's a proper place, it's fine, but it's better to avoid shabby stores on street corners. CF: I see, that's how it is. The people over there are strong. BW: Yes, Japanese people are considerate, but people over there are strong in various ways. CF: It's a forward-thinking idea and a sensibility that Japanese people don't have. I respect that aspect. BW: That's right, if Japanese people can remain humble while becoming assertive, they would be unbeatable. CF: That's right! Japanese people have good qualities. BW: There are also many foreigners who like Japan. CF: I understand. Before COVID-19, there was a lot of bustling tourism. BW: I see, it seems to be avoided now because the regulations are too strict, it's sad. CF: I hope Japan returns to how it was before COVID-19. Thank you for the conversation! BW: ""Thank you very much!"""
3,"CF: Good evening! BW: Good evening, it has been hot every day, but are you feeling alright? CF: Thank you for your concern! That's right, apart from the cavities, there are no other problems at all. BW: I have a cavity too, I need to go soon. CF: I'm not good with dentists, but at the end of June, I had such severe pain that I decided to start going. BW: I dislike it too. I go when it becomes really unavoidable, but I tend to stay away. CF: ""It's also bothersome to go for regular check-ups after the cavity treatment."" BW: Recently, it takes a long time for dentists to completely cure everything, and check-ups are also tough, aren't they? CF: I see. I had quite a few cavities, so it looks like I'll have to go to the dentist for a long time, which I don't like. BW: I went once for treatment two years ago, but I stopped going after the part that I was concerned about was finished. CF: I understand! That's right! I was like that about three years ago too. BW: Even if it gets better after going, it soon gets worse again; I really want to find a dentist that suits me. CF: That's right. There are so many dentists nowadays, it's hard to know which one is good. BW: ""There are so many, I hear reviews and such, but I won't know until I go myself."" CF: There can be differences between reviews and the actual experience. BW: I see, even if it's popular, there have been times when it didn't suit me. CF: I understand! That's how the last dentist was! BW: It's difficult, isn't it? When you fix it, food gets stuck in your teeth even more, and it's troublesome. CF: That's troubling! I feel like complaining. BW: I see, my friend also said that it was tough because of the sensitivity from correcting the gap in their front teeth. CF: ""Braces might cause sensitivity and make you irritable! They are expensive, aren't they?"" BW: That's right, it seemed like they didn't get much response even when they reported it, which was unfortunate. CF: Dentists in general are quite expensive, so it makes me sad when something comes up that needs attention. BW: Hey! If it seems like it's not going well, I'd really like you to handle it properly. CF: That's right! But in reality, I can't say it. BW: My friend couldn't say it at the moment and seemed to have communicated it quite a bit later. CF: I see. Were they able to respond? BW: I think it wasn't possible, but it seems they did it for an additional fee. CF: ""An additional fee! I might feel a bit uneasy about that. Thank you for the valuable information!"" BW: That's right, thank you very much!"
4,"CF: Good evening! BW: Good evening, do you usually exercise? CF: ""That's a startling question. Not at all."" BW: ""That's right, I've been slacking off a bit too because I've been so busy."" CF: I went to do water walking at the municipal heated pool a while ago, and I swore I'd go every week! BW: Is underwater walking fun? It seems like it would be a great workout. CF: It's fun! I just go back and forth in the 50m pool and occasionally swim using the flutter kick. BW: I see, I feel like swimming vigorously. Is it possible to swim normally now? CF: I used to be able to do both the crawl and breaststroke, but it's probably impossible for me now. BW: I haven't swum much either, but if it's not crowded, it would be nice to have some space to swim. CF: I wonder how it is now. The municipal pool I go to is open until around 9 PM, so it seems to be less crowded in the evening. BW: I see, there are also places that are divided into swimming areas and walking areas. CF: ""Yes, that's really a good thing."" BW: ""That's right, but it's hard to keep going regularly."" CF: ""It takes determination to continue anything, doesn't it?"" BW: Without some kind of goal, it's difficult; now I just stretch at home occasionally. CF: You are great. I do simple stretches when I have been working on the computer for a long time, but only at that time. BW: If you use the computer for a long time, your body will get stiff. CF: ""It gets messed up. You can tell that blood flow is getting worse."" BW: Hey, my shoulders and lower back seem to be getting sore. I want to make time to exercise, though. CF: Isn't it difficult to find time when work and other things are busy? BW: That's right, it ends up being postponed with ""I'll do it tomorrow."" CF: I understand very well! BW: I think it would be better to manage it with an app so that it can be done consistently every day. CF: Nowadays, you can manage quite well with smartwatches and smartphones, too. BW: Yes, it is convenient, so it is better to make use of it. CF: I manage my sleep time with my smartphone. I check it every day. BW: I see, nowadays you can monitor various things like sleep and heart rate. CF: ""It has become convenient. Thank you for the talk!"" BW: Yes, thank you as well."
5,"CF: Good evening! Nice to meet you. BW: Nice to meet you, is there something you've been into recently? CF: I see, I've gotten hooked on casual cycling again. BW: What is pottering? It's the first time I've heard of it, what is it? CF: It means aimlessly wandering around on a bicycle. It's fun. BW: ""Wow, that sounds interesting. Do you feel like exploring the city or nature?"" CF: I see. When I search on video sites like YouTube, various things come up, but I especially like exploring the city. BW: I'll check it out on YouTube, it looks like the town is also fun. CF: I like watching pottering videos on YouTube, especially Shibuya pottering. BW: I just learned about this for the first time, it's interesting to learn new things. Thank you for teaching me. CF: No, no, please do take a look. Is there anything you are hooked on recently? BW: Lately, I've been practicing the ukulele again after a long time. CF: Can you play the ukulele? That's amazing! BW: I used to play a long time ago, but after watching some videos, playing and singing looked like fun, so I practiced. CF: ""Playing and singing! That's amazing! What song are you practicing?"" BW: Hawaiian songs, and Western songs like the ones sung by the person in the video. CF: That's great! It's really cool. BW: ""I'm not able to do it at all, but do you listen to music?"" CF: Yes, I listen to Japanese music and game soundtracks. BW: I see, I understand the old ones when it comes to games, but what are the recent ones like? CF: The soundtracks of the games are often from ones I used to play. BW: Oh, like Dragon Quest or Mario? CF: I occasionally hear about Dragon Quest! Also, things like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. BW: As expected, the music of Final Fantasy is famous, isn't it? CF: Yes. I liked it then, and I like it now. BW: The game music is quite wonderful too, isn't it? Mr. Koichi Sugiyama from Dragon Quest passed away a while ago. CF: He was a great person. I hope that such good things will continue to remain in the future. BW: That's right, perhaps games and game music are something Japan can be proud of. CF: I think so too. Thank you for the conversation! BW: That's right, thank you very much."
6,"CF: Good morning. It's sunny and refreshing this morning. BQ: Good morning. It is raining here. CF: Is it a typhoon? BQ: That might also have an impact. CF: I see. It rained heavily here yesterday, so please be careful there as well. BQ: Thank you very much. Recently, there has been a lot of heavy rain in various places, hasn't there? CF: That's right. In familiar areas, flooding is frightening. BQ: Have you ever experienced flood damage? CF: There was a time when a bridge over the nearby river collapsed, but that's about it. Have you ever experienced anything like that? BQ: My town is fine, but the neighboring town is particularly vulnerable to flooding. CF: I see. Cleaning up after the water recedes from a flood is really challenging, isn't it? BQ: Yes, I heard the smell is also strong. CF: Especially in the summer, things spoil quickly. BQ: Do you think insurance covers flood damage? CF: I wonder how it will turn out. I thought it would go down, but I am anxious. BQ: I heard that in the case of a fire, insurance won't be paid out unless it's a total loss, so I'm a bit worried. CF: Is that so! That is troubling. BQ: Are you doing anything for disaster prevention? CF: Well, I might not have done much. Just about preparing some stockpiles. BQ: I haven't done anything in particular either. We should prepare for stockpiling, right? CF: It would be nice, wouldn't it? There are cookies that can be stored for five years. BQ: There are ones that can be rehydrated with water, right? They seem to be quite delicious. CF: I heard that recent ones are very well-made and delicious, so I would like to try them once. BQ: It's important to get used to the taste, isn't it? I hope there will be no need to actually use it, though. CF: That's true. Floods are scary, but earthquakes might be the scariest. BQ: They say another big earthquake is coming, right? That's why we have to take measures because we can't avoid it. CF: Every year, I live thinking ""This year will come!"" but I'm reflecting on the fact that my stockpile is still not quite enough. BQ: There are also feelings of not wanting to think about disasters, aren't there? CF: ""I tend to look away from reality. Thank you for the talk!"" BQ: Thank you very much."
7,"CF: Good morning. BQ: Good morning. It's Obon, do you have any plans? CF: Actually, we should visit the grave, but since COVID-19 is still quite prevalent, we won't be doing it this year either. BQ: I see. Since I live nearby, I went there yesterday. CF: That was good. It's hot because there are no shadows in the cemetery, right? BQ: That's right. I was drenched in sweat. CF: Your ancestors will be pleased. Do you have any plans to go out besides during Obon? BQ: I plan to go to a nearby hot spring. CF: ""Hot springs are nice, aren't they? Do you go often?"" BQ: I stay overnight about once a year, but I often go on day trips. CF: That's lovely. How nice. BQ: Do you like hot springs? CF: I love it! I used to go to super sento a lot in the past. BQ: Super sento (public bathhouse) is so comfortable that you can spend an entire day there. CF: I understand. Nowadays, there are places that look like manga cafes, and they seem fun. BQ: That's nice. I used to like taking naps in a place like a theater room. CF: I understand! It's nice, isn't it! I slept well. BQ: Rice dishes are delicious, aren't they? Like ramen. CF: That's right! Snacks and beer are also good. BQ: ""It's the best right after a bath. There was someone nicely drunk."" CF: One of them must be me! BQ: It seems there are also places where you can stay. CF: I have never stayed there, but it's convenient when you miss the last train, isn't it? BQ: There is also that way of using it, I see. That was helpful. CF: If I miss the last train and need to stay somewhere, I'd prefer a super sento where I can stay overnight. BQ: ""It's cramped at the manga cafe, right? And there's only a shower."" CF: That's right. Well, it's best to go home properly without staying over. BQ: Do you usually commute by train? CF: No, I work from home, so there is no commute. BQ: Working from home is nice. Thank you very much. CF: ""I'll be lazy, but see you later!"""
8,"CF: Good morning. Are you the type of person who gets up early and stays active in the morning? BQ: Good morning. I usually wake up around 7:30. CF: I see. I wake up around 5 a.m. on weekdays. BQ: You're up early. Do you go for a walk or something? CF: An ideal morning would involve taking a walk, but unfortunately, I'm too busy taking care of and preparing things for my family. BQ: That's tiring. I hope you can get some good rest sometimes. CF: I wake up early to make bento. Since I like to sleep, I want to do that. BQ: Making bento lunches is tough, isn't it? Feel free to take it easy by using frozen foods. CF: You use frozen food a lot, don't you? What do you like to have in your lunchbox? BQ: Frozen is fine, but I would be happy if it includes grilled salted salmon. CF: Sounds good! It's a classic. BQ: ""Even when it gets cold, it's still delicious, isn't it? Do you have any favorite side dishes in bento?"" CF: I am kinpira and shibazuke. BQ: Sounds good. I prefer sweet kinpira. CF: That's right. I feel like they understand when they sprinkle white sesame seeds on it. BQ: ""You seem like an expert. How many years have you been making bento?"" CF: Entered the 13th year. BQ: You've been doing it for over 10 years, haven't you? You're already a professional at making bento. CF: Thank you very much. Despite making it for so long, I’m still bad at making tamagoyaki. BQ: Making tamagoyaki seems difficult. Do you prefer it sweet or savory? CF: I prefer salty, but since the person eating it likes sweet, I'll make it sweet. BQ: I prefer sweet ones. How can I bake them as beautifully as in stores? CF: That's right. I can't wrap it well! It's difficult. BQ: On the contrary, is there a bento side dish that you are confident no one can beat? CF: Hamburger steak and kinpira! BQ: ""Hamburger steak and kinpira are amazing, aren't they? They seem more difficult than tamagoyaki."" CF: ""Both are prepared the day before, so I'm good at just packing them as they are."" BQ: Prepared meals are a housewife's ally, aren't they? It's amazing that you prepare them the day before. CF: I could make it in the morning, but I want to sleep as much as possible! Thank you for the conversation! BQ: Thank you very much."
9,"CF: Good morning. I thought I would buy something I want since payday is next week. BQ: Good morning. Thank you for your hard work. What do you want? CF: It is a display that can be connected to a computer. BQ: The display is nice. There are various types, aren't there? CF: I want to connect it to a laptop and have two screens. BQ: ""That's a multi-display, isn't it? It looks like it will make work more efficient."" CF: I want to watch videos while working. BQ: That's nice. I also want to add another display, but I can't find a good one. CF: It's difficult to choose when there are many options, isn't it? BQ: I long for a monitor arm. CF: He's a cool guy, I'm in admiration. BQ: I want to move it around a lot. I'm aiming for a Japanese-made one, but even the used ones are expensive. CF: ""That's quite a good price, isn't it? That's something to ponder."" BQ: I heard that my eyes don't get tired at all. If it's expensive, it must have good performance. CF: I see, I didn't know that. BQ: We should be mindful of our eyes when using the computer for long periods of time. CF: I understand. I got blue light blocking glasses. BQ: How effective are blue light blocking glasses? CF: I think it's like very lightly tinted sunglasses. BQ: I see. Is there a difference when you're not wearing it? CF: I think the brightness is different, after all. BQ: I see. Do you mean it feels dark? CF: Yes, compared to glasses without blue light cut, you can really tell the difference. BQ: I see. I will consider it as well. CF: Certainly! If there's any drawback, it's that the glasses apparently reflect blue light depending on the viewing angle from others. BQ: That's scary. It might be a little cool though. CF: When elementary school students see it, they seem to go ""Wow!"" BQ: I thought it was like the Terminator. CF: It looks that way, doesn't it! I couldn't help but laugh. Thank you for the story! BQ: Thank you very much."
10,"CF: Good morning. It's a bit cool this morning, isn't it? BZ: Good morning. It's incredibly humid! CF: I see! It might be because the weather is going to get worse. BZ: That's right. I'll go visit the grave while the weather holds. CF: Speaking of which, it's Obon, isn't it? BZ: That's right. The sense of seasons is disappearing. CF: Isn't it surprisingly hot in a cemetery because there are no shaded areas? BZ: Sure. You should go as soon as possible! CF: It seems like it would be good to go in the morning. Here, there's a typhoon so I'm staying at home. BZ: Ah, did the Kanto region take a direct hit today? CF: Given that, it’s sunny now, so I’m wondering what will happen. BZ: ""If we prepare, the typhoon won't come, right?"" CF: ""It's strange, isn't it! This time we're quite well-prepared though."" BZ: That's right. The typhoon is changing direction towards places that are not prepared. CF: ""Well, they might not come here. It's a good thing, but it's a bit frustrating."" BZ: And then, if you're off guard, it'll come! CF: When you've eaten up all your stockpiled food, right? I understand! BZ: In any case, I pray that it doesn't get worse! CF: Thank you. Actually, I wanted to go out to eat, so I'll consider it while keeping an eye on the situation. BZ: However, it is humid. The room temperature is already 31 degrees. CF: ""It's high! This one looks a bit lower but feels more humid."" BZ: There is a nice breeze blowing outside. I think I'll cut some bellflowers from the garden and take them to the grave. CF: Having bellflowers in the garden is nice. BZ: I liked it so much that I divided and replanted it many times, and now my garden is full of bellflowers. CF: That's nice! I'm envious because it's something that's hard to do on a condominium balcony. BZ: We also live on the second and third floors. There's a small garden, or rather, a flower bed on the first floor. CF: Oh! I was just regretting the fact that I let my cherry tomato plant wither the other day. BZ: That was unfortunate. Did you not eat any at all? CF: Actually, I was quite satisfied with how much I managed to achieve! I'll do my best next time. Thank you for the conversation! BZ: Thank you very much, too!"
