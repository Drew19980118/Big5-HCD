1,"BJ: Good morning! AN: Good morning! BJ: What are you doing today? AN: Today, I'll be going blueberry picking in the afternoon! BJ: Wow! That looks like so much fun! AN: That's right. While taking a walk near my house, I accidentally found a blueberry farm. BJ: It's nice that there is such a place in your neighborhood. Are blueberries in season during summer? AN: It seems to be in season until the end of August. BJ: I see. It's nice, picking fruits is fun, isn't it? AN: It's fun, isn't it! I went strawberry picking in the spring! BJ: That's an impressive frequency! You must like fruits. AN: I love fruit. The children also love fruit very much. BJ: Sounds good. The last time I went grape picking was a few years ago. AN: Is that so? Is the grape picking for Delaware grapes? Or Kyoho grapes? BJ: It was Shine Muscat. To Yamanashi! AN: ""Is that a Shine Muscat grape? It looks super delicious!"" BJ: ""It was delicious, but I ate a lifetime's worth. I haven't had Shine Muscat since that day."" AN: It seems there are not many opportunities to eat Shine Muscat until you're full. What a precious experience! BJ: ""That's true. What is your favorite fruit?"" AN: What could it be? Is it a cherry or a strawberry? BJ: Cherries are nice. I haven't eaten them in a while. AN: Similarly, I couldn't eat cherries this year. BJ: ""It's expensive when you try to buy it, isn't it? Fruits."" AN: ""It's expensive. Cherries and the like are luxury items."" BJ: I also only eat bananas on a daily basis, lol. AN: Speaking of bananas, haven't the prices of bananas gone up recently? BJ: Eh, really? It doesn't feel real. AN: Around here, bananas used to be about 100 yen, but lately they are around 200 yen. BJ: Eh, that's expensive. AN: ""That's right. I really hope prices will stabilize. Well, I guess it's about time to wrap it up around here!"""
2,"BJ: Hello! BS: Hello! BJ: How often do you usually watch TV? BS: One way or another, I end up watching it every day. During breakfast and dinner. BJ: Oh! Do you have any favorite shows? BS: I like Kaji Yaro and Banana Man's Sekkaku Gourmet! BJ: It feels like dinner time! You like comedians, don't you? BS: That's right. If anything, I like food, so I guess you could say I like it. Do you watch TV? BJ: I see. Hmm, about once or twice a week, I guess. BS: Do you feel like watching a specific program? BJ: ""Well, it's probably something like 'Wednesday Downtown'."" BS: ""Was it the program that starts around 10 PM?"" BJ: That's right! Haven't you seen it? BS: It seems like something I've seen before... I think it was a program verifying some theory... BJ: Yes, that's right. Pranks are mainstream, I suppose. BS: Is that so! Do you like pranks? Or is it comedians that you like? BJ: I like pranks and comedians too! Do you have a favorite comedian? BS: I see! Is it Sandwich Man? And Jiro from Shisonnu just makes me laugh by looking at him. BJ: Both of them are very wonderful people! I like them too. BS: Sure. Here is the translated sentence: ""That's nice. The Sandwichman duo is also great because their hosting is steady."" BJ: No matter how many times I watch the year Sandwichman won the M-1, I end up crying. BS: I see! I'll take a look! Do you have a favorite comedian? BJ: Hmmm. I think the amazing one is Mr. Tanaka from Ungirls. BS: What do you think is amazing about it? BJ: Not only are they a weird character, but I also think they must be smart because they're strong in comedy improvisation! BS: You are also good at Ogiri! You certainly have an intelligent image. BJ: I get the feeling of an entertainer. BS: Certainly. I do miss the Janga Janga era. BJ: Wow, that brings back memories. Well then, let's end here for today. Thank you very much. BS: Thank you very much!"
3,"BJ: Hello! BS: Hello! BJ: I want to start something new, but what do you do on your days off? BS: That's nice! Lately, I've been going to the library a lot. BJ: Library! It's really wonderful! BS: There is a relatively large library quite close to my house! BJ: Do you like books? BS: That's right. I love books! Digital ones are nice, but I like the feel of paper. BJ: ""Sounds good. I haven't read a book recently."" BS: I see. Is there a library or bookstore nearby? BJ: Neither of them are at the nearest station. What kind of books do you like? BS: That's unfortunate. I used to read novels in the past, but recently it's more practical books and self-help genres. BJ: So, if I think about it, it might have been years since I last read properly. If you have any recommendations, I would love to hear them! BS: I see. The book that helped lower the hurdle of finding cooking a hassle during this season was a book called ""Tsumamimeshi""! BJ: ""I have never heard of tsumami-meshi!"" BS: Do you know the culinary researcher Ryuji? BJ: I know! I often watch recipe videos. BS: ""The video is interesting, isn't it! It's that person's recipe book!"" BJ: ""You're the one who cooks while getting drunk, right?"" BS: Yes, yes. He is the one who is drunk on YouTube but proper on terrestrial television. BJ: Ah, you are publishing a book. That seems useful. BS: ""Yes. It's quick to make, so it helps during dinner time."" BJ: ""Is that book also available in the library!?"" BS: Yes, it's there! There are also quite a few recipe books, which is very helpful. BJ: Amazing, it seems to be quite a big place. I feel like going to the library again after a long time. BS: Yes, I think the library is a good idea! They also have magazines and such! BJ: More than anything, it's free, right? It would be great if there was a movie version of the library too. BS: Oh, the library I go to also allows you to watch DVDs! BJ: Such an amazing place! I will try to visit next time. Thank you for the wonderful suggestion. BS: Yes, please enjoy."
4,"BJ: Hello! BQ: Hello. BJ: What do you do on your days off? BQ: I'm mostly at home. I often watch subscription services. BJ: ""Oh, is it like Netflix?"" BQ: Yes, yes. I recently joined U-NEXT on a trial basis. BJ: I am also subscribed to U-NEXT. Do you like movies? BQ: I'm not very knowledgeable about it, but I like it. BJ: Have you watched anything on subscription services recently? BQ: I watched 20th Century Boys as a movie. BJ: ""Oh, the live-action one?"" BQ: Yes, it's Kenji-kun. BJ: I saw it when it was first released. Was it interesting? BQ: I also saw it in the theater and thought I wanted to watch it again, so it was interesting. BJ: ""It's nostalgic. If it's between Japanese and Western movies, is it Japanese movies?"" BQ: ""I guess I watch Japanese movies more often."" BJ: ""Oh, then U-NEXT is good. It has a lot of Japanese movies."" BQ: There are more works compared to other subscriptions, even though it's more expensive. BJ: Yes, it will be cheaper if you share with your friends. BQ: I didn't know that something like share exists. BJ: I think up to four people can participate. The monthly fee can also be divided into four parts. BQ: That's a good deal. Can you also read magazines? BJ: Yes, including manga. Though you mostly need points for them. BQ: I see. Are you subscribed to any other services? BJ: I am subscribed to Netflix and Amazon. BQ: ""Quite a few people have joined, haven't they? I'm subscribed to Disney Plus."" BJ: It seems like there are a lot of interesting things on Disney Plus recently. BQ: The short film of Baymax was interesting. BJ: ""Is there such a thing? I'd like to see it."" BQ: I recommend it."
5,"BJ: Hello! BQ: Hello. BJ: What is your favorite food? BQ: I like tonkatsu. BJ: Ah, I love it too. BQ: Do you prefer fillet or loin? BJ: ""Is it the fin? And you?"" BQ: I like roast. BJ: The loin is more reasonable and good, isn't it! BQ: It feels big and like a good deal, doesn't it? BJ: What do you like to put on? BQ: It's definitely sauce. BJ: Sounds good. The royal road. BQ: What will you put on? BJ: I also prefer sauce, but recently I've come to think that salt is tasty too. BQ: You are a true connoisseur. As for me, I prefer to eat grilled meat with salt. BJ: ""That's more sophisticated! It's the first time I've heard that."" BQ: I eat yakiniku sauce, but salt works quite well too. BJ: I've only ever eaten it with sauce. BQ: What do you order first at a yakiniku restaurant? BJ: That's the tongue. BQ: I am also Tan. Everyone asks for an image. BJ: Recently, I haven't been able to eat as much ribs as I used to. BQ: I understand. The fat can be heavy, right? I've started ordering chicken more often. BJ: ""That's right. Birds are nice too. Also, organ meats and such."" BQ: ""I have not tried hormone dishes yet. Are they delicious?"" BJ: I like it! Preferences might vary though. BQ: There are various types of hormones, but which one do you like? BJ: Hearts and liver, I guess. BQ: ""It's a classic. I'm starting to get hungry."""
6,"BJ: Good evening! BQ: Good evening. BJ: Did you have dinner? BQ: I ate sushi from the supermarket for dinner. BJ: ""Sushi? Sounds good."" BQ: ""It was quite delicious. What did you eat there?"" BJ: I ate a Chinese rice bowl. BQ: ""Chinese rice bowl sounds good. Is it from a restaurant?"" BJ: No, it's instant food. It wasn't very tasty. BQ: That's unfortunate. I get happy when there's a quail egg on top. BJ: I like quail eggs too. There were some small ones on it. BQ: There are various kinds of retort foods, and that's nice, isn't it? BJ: Recently, the quality is high, isn't it? It's not retort-pouched, but convenience stores are astonishing. BQ: It's authentic, isn't it? The product development seems impressive. BJ: No, it's true. Do you have a chance to eat it? BQ: ""On my days off and such, I am quite indebted to you."" BJ: ""It's delicious, isn't it? I like Seven the most."" BQ: ""I'm also loyal to Seven-Eleven. But I'd like them to stop using false bottoms."" BJ: That's right, and recently it has become really expensive, hasn't it? BQ: ""The prices have increased, haven't they? There are also cases where the quantity decreases but the price remains the same."" BJ: Here it is. There it was. The most surprising thing was that the fried chicken stick was 180 yen. BQ: Was it like that? That's surprising. BJ: When I was a student, I remember it being 100 yen. BQ: Coffee has gradually gone up in price too, hasn't it? BJ: Oh, really? I didn't know that. BQ: It seems to have gone up by about 10 yen. Convenience stores are originally quite expensive, so it's tough, isn't it? BJ: ""Even so, there are people who buy it."" BQ: As long as I can still afford it, I think it's okay, but I'm worried that I might not be able to keep up with the price increases. BJ: ""All these price increases are really frustrating."" BQ: It's true, isn't it? There's probably no chance of a price reduction anytime soon."
7,"BJ: Good evening! BQ: Good evening. BJ: What is the thing you want the most right now? BQ: I'm undecided. Should it be a car? BJ: Nice car! Is there a specific type you want? BQ: Anyway, it feels like I want a car. Someday, I'd like to ride in a sedan. BJ: If you have a car, it can be quite convenient for various things. BQ: That's right. Is there a car you would like to drive? BJ: I would like to ride a Beetle Cabriolet someday. BQ: I just looked it up, and it's cool. I want to try driving a convertible. BJ: It looks nice, doesn't it? I'm not very knowledgeable about it, but I would like to try riding it. BQ: I don't know much about it either, but just looking cool is good enough, right? BJ: Yes, because I don't really understand things like fuel efficiency yet. BQ: I've heard that nowadays, no car has particularly bad fuel economy. BJ: I see, it would be nice to ride it someday! BQ: Yes, that's right. I'll make it my goal for a while. BJ: I think it's good. BQ: Thank you very much. What do you want the most? BJ: ""Hmm, it's probably money."" BQ: It's the ultimate item that can be used for anything. BJ: The truth is, I'm thinking about getting married. BQ: That's wonderful news. You'll need a lot of things, won't you? BJ: Thank you very much. However, regarding that, it is a bit realistically difficult without money. BQ: I see. Are you talking about wedding expenses? BJ: I see, and also simply considering the living costs for two people and various other things. BQ: A home is a difficult issue, isn't it? I hope the two of you can come to a satisfying decision. BJ: That's right. Thank you very much. I think married people in the world are amazing. BQ: I am first looking for a partner, but people who are really married are amazing, aren't they? BJ: You will definitely meet a wonderful partner. BQ: Thank you very much. I pray that you both will always be happy."
8,"BJ: Hello! AU: Hello! BJ: What were you doing this morning? AU: ""In the morning, I was out picking up and dropping off my daughter at cram school. How about you?"" BJ: You have a daughter! I watched a movie. AU: Movies are nice, what did you watch? BJ: It is a movie called ""Forrest Gump"". AU: I have never seen it, but it is a famous movie, right? BJ: That's right. I've recently become addicted to watching movies that are considered masterpieces but that I haven't seen. AU: That's nice. Since our time at home is increasing, we want to watch various things. BJ: Yes, I originally like movies. Do you watch movies? AU: Since it's summer vacation, the day before yesterday I watched a show on Netflix about stigmatized properties with my child. BJ: Oh, horror, nice! Was it scary? AU: Yes, when I watched a horror movie for the first time in a while, it was quite scary. Movies based on true stories feel even scarier. BJ: ""It's nice and summery, isn't it? Horror. I also recently watched a movie called Juso on Netflix."" AU: I haven't seen it yet. Was it interesting? BJ: This might be the scariest horror I've seen so far. It might not be suitable for children. AU: It sounds interesting. Do you think it might be too stimulating for children? BJ: Is it something that might be surprising? Is your child okay with scary things? AU: No, it's more like watching while clinging to me and saying they're scared. BJ: That's right, you can't see those things when you're little, can you? AU: Even though I'm easily frightened, I still want to watch horror movies. Do you have any other movie recommendations? BJ: ""Is it in horror?"" AU: Whether it's horror or not, it's fine. BJ: If you haven't seen it yet, how about the movie ""Orphan""? It's not a horror, but it is scary. AU: Does it feel like psychological fear? BJ: It's so human-like... it was too interesting that I watched it about three times. AU: Oh, that is really something to look forward to! BJ: Certainly! I highly recommend it. Thank you so much for today! AU: I think I would like to see it. Thank you very much."
9,"BJ: Hello! AU: Hello! BJ: Do you have anyone you respect? AU: Someone I respect? No one in particular. How about you, do you have someone? BJ: I'm not sure if I can say I respect him, but I guess it's Ichiro. AU: Ichiro, do you also like baseball? BJ: ""I used to do it when I was in elementary school. Do you like it?"" AU: I'm not good at sports and I don't understand baseball at all. Do you go to watch baseball games? BJ: I see. I don't actually go to watch it in person very often. I occasionally watch the broadcast. AU: My father used to watch baseball broadcasts a lot at home, so I couldn't watch my favorite TV shows. BJ: ""Oh, that's something that happens often. Do you like TV?"" AU: I don't really like it, and if anything, I mostly watch videos. BJ: Are you referring to something like YouTube? AU: ""Netflix and YouTube are the main ones. Recently, since it's summer vacation, my kids have almost completely taken over Netflix."" BJ: I see. Once you start watching, you can't stop, right? AU: That's right, and if it's a series, you keep wanting to watch more and more. Do you also watch TV dramas? BJ: That's why I watch dramas on Netflix! I love it. AU: I love American TV shows. They have an entertaining quality that allows you to watch without thinking. BJ: Do you have any recommendations? AU: Do you know the modern version of the old TV drama called ""Fuller House""? BJ: Oh, I've only heard the name! What kind of story is it? AU: In the past, it was broadcast under the name ""Full House."" It's called a home comedy drama, right? Are you interested in that kind of thing? BJ: Ah, Full House! I know it, I know it. I like it. I used to watch it a lot when I was a kid. AU: ""That's it! It was fun back in the day, wasn't it? I loved that."" BJ: ""There is a modern version of that, isn't there?"" AU: Yes. All the children have completely grown up. It's strange, but I watch them while remembering the old days. BJ: That sounds interesting. I am watching a Korean drama. AU: ""Everyone says that once you start watching Korean dramas, you get hooked! Do you have any recommendations?"" BJ: Lawyer Woo Young-woo is a genius! It's interesting! AU: Is it a series? I'll check it out next time."
10,"BJ: Hello! BL: Hello. BJ: Is there anything you are not good at? BL: Are you talking about food? BJ: ""It's fine with anything in this world in general."" BL: In that case, would it be something like a cockroach? BJ: Wow, I'm exactly the same. I can't handle insects. For that reason, I can't eat shrimp. BL: I see. BJ: It's gross, isn't it? BL: I suppose so, I've heard they've been around since ancient times, so it can't be helped. BJ: By the way, what food are you not good with? BL: I don't like raisins. BJ: Is it the appearance? Or the taste? BL: It's the texture. BJ: ""Many people are not good at it, right?"" BL: I see. Many people around me can eat it. BJ: Ah, really? My younger sister also hates raisins and would often pick them out of raisin bread and throw them away, which would get her scolded. BL: That bread is really troublesome. Then there's raisin butter. BJ: ""Oh, I haven't eaten it much. How about rum raisin ice cream?"" BL: I wouldn't choose that either. BJ: Well, I can completely live without eating raisins. BL: I see. I think it's good that I don't have many opportunities to eat that. BJ: ""There are many people who understand. I have trouble explaining why I dislike shrimp because everyone else likes it."" BL: There were also people who disliked shrimp. The reasons were different, though. BJ: Is that true? What kind of reason is it? BL: The person said it was because it didn't taste good. BJ: ""That's unusual. I like the taste, though."" BL: There are various preferences, aren't there? BJ: Yes, the human tongue is mysterious. BL: The wonders of taste, aren't they?"
