1,"AC: Hello! Nice to meet you. AA: Hello, thank you in advance. AC: Today, the weather is a bit cooler and comfortable. AA: Really! I hope you can keep up this pace tomorrow as well. AC: ""That's true! Having over 35 degrees every day is murderous."" AA: Really! I spent my time wondering what on earth it was. AC: ""Right! Which do you tolerate better, heat or cold?"" AA: I prefer it to be cold. AC: Me too! I crawl under the down comforter when it's cold. AA: I understand. If it's cold, you can just put on more clothes, but if it's hot, there's nothing you can do about it. AC: Yes, exactly! And also, sweat! AA: That's right!!! It's stuck on and unpleasant. AC: Yes! I feel like the concentration of my sweat has increased with age. AA: I kind of understand. I feel like it was smoother when I was younger. AC: ""Sure! When I was a child, I felt more at ease."" AA: Really. I shouldn't have disliked summer either. AC: That's right! Actually, I liked summer more for various reasons. AA: Summer vacation is long, isn't it? AC: Yes, yes. Did you finish your summer vacation homework early? AA: It should have been the type to finish by early August. I might be idealizing it too much, though. AC: ""Great job! I remember almost crying towards the end."" AA: So you were the type to leave it until the end. AC: Um, the picture diary? That was the most painful! AA: Ah, that! It's something you have to write every day. AC: Yes, yes. If you keep that bottled up, it’s disastrous. AA: I don't even remember things from a few days ago. AC: Hey. I feel like I only wrote about things like what I ate for breakfast every day. AA: You were writing about breakfast, how cute. AC: No, no, I should have been writing properly every day! Well then, that's all for today! AA: Yes, thank you very much!"
2,"AC: Hello! Nice to meet you! AA: Hello! Nice to meet you! AC: Do you have any plans to go out today? AA: There is nothing after this! AC: It feels like relaxing at home! AA: That's right! After all, home is the most relaxing place. AC: I also love being at home. What do you do at home? AA: At home, I watch videos, read books, and take naps. AC: I also watch videos occasionally. Do you have any favorite YouTube channels? AA: I don't have any favorites, I just kind of stare off into space watching something. AC: I see. Related videos keep coming up, don't they? AA: Related videos are amazing, aren't they? They always match my preferences. AC: I agree! What kind of things are on display these days? AA: ""The animals are lined up, aren't they? It's so calming."" AC: ""I also have quite a few. Mostly Mochimaru-sama."" AA: ""Wow, that's nice!"" AC: ""Also, Akina Nakamori and other idols from the 80s have been coming up recently."" AA: Oh, do you often hear about that area? AC: No, not really, but when I searched for Masayuki Suzuki the other day, it came up. AA: Related videos, you work fast. AC: ""That's right. Thanks to that, I'm indulging in nostalgic songs from the '80s."" AA: ""It becomes enjoyable, doesn't it? Like, oh that happened, or something like that."" AC: Yes! There were some really nostalgic songs, and the music shows were nostalgic too. AA: I don't really understand the current music programs, so seeing something like that makes me happy. AC: Me too. When I watched the video of the night hit studio, it had a strong Showa era feel. AA: Why does nostalgia make us feel this strange way? AC: The memories of that time come flooding back with the songs, right? Like the theme songs of dramas. AA: Theme song of the drama! It totally feels like that. AC: That's right! When you spend time at home today, check out some nostalgic songs! AA: I will do that, thank you!"
3,"AC: Hello there! Hi! AA: Hello! AC: Today, I want to talk about my student days! AA: ""Shall we look back?"" AC: Let's talk about our student days! AA: ""Challenging! I wonder, is it a class?"" AC: Whoa! Are you serious?! AA: I hate it because I don't have any other memorable memories. AC: ""How about club activities or first love?"" AA: ""Let me ask you first then! What about your student days?"" AC: It was a club activity. We were living our youth! AA: ""Wow! Youth!"" AC: ""Right! A romance with my senior!"" AA: I really want to ask, I really want to ask! AC: You know, like, my first date, hehe. AA: I'm really interested. AC: On my first date, I tripped spectacularly on the stairs at the station. AA: No way, seriously. AC: I have never been so embarrassed before or since! AA: ""Senpai, you're totally creeped out, aren't you?"" AC: Right? Honestly, I also felt awkward and somehow it just faded away naturally. AA: Ah, no, I might have thought it was cute, so maybe!! AC: How about it? High school students don't seem to have that much adult composure. AA: Is it the composure of an adult? That's what I want most right now. AC: Is that so? So, is your current romance also quite thrilling and keeping you on your toes? AA: Wait, stop. I've never been in love before. AC: ""Again and again! Next time we meet, I'm going to ask you all about it."" AA: ""Hey, stop it! Let's continue the conversation!"" AC: Please look forward to it! Well then, until next time! AA: Again and again!"
4,"AC: Hello! AA: Hello! AC: Have you been to the 100 yen shop recently? AA: I went to buy cleaning supplies. AC: Oh, timely! What area are you cleaning? AA: It's a water pipe, right? Look, it's something that cleans just by putting it in. AC: ""Ah, yes, I have! I didn't realize I could buy that for 100 yen!"" AA: You can buy it! But only the 100-yen store knows if they are really listening. AC: ""That's something that happens often, isn't it? Like the saying 'you get what you pay for.'"" AA: ""That's right, not everything can be done with just 100 yen."" AC: ""That hurts to hear. I just realized it recently."" AA: Oh, for example? AC: I bought a calculator, but it broke in less than a month. AA: 100 yen, 30 days of life AC: ""Argh! When you say it like that, it hurts my ears even more!"" AA: ""It sounds harsh when put into words."" AC: It is. If you properly spend more than 1,000 yen, it will last for about 20 years! AA: You learned for 100 yen. That's great! AC: ""Yes! Let's stay positive!"" AA: Yes, yes! It's fun to go around the 100 yen shop, isn't it? AC: Oh, I understand! There are quite a lot of interesting things in miscellaneous goods. AA: ""That's right. I discover things like, 'Oh, there's something like this.'"" AC: ""I agree. There are also convenient kitchen utensils!"" AA: Yes, indeed!! When I move, I first make purchases there. AC: Oh! What kind of things have you bought? AA: I bought tongs. These tongs can also cut and serve as a bowl. AC: ""Even though it's tongs, it's also a bowl! Is it huge?"" AA: No, no, it's just a normal size, but it's enough to drain pasta! AC: ""That looks convenient! I'll try looking for it at Daiso next time!"" AA: By all means, by all means! Thank you very much!"
5,"AC: Hello! Nice to meet you. AA: Hello. AC: ""By the way, do you have insurance?"" AA: Ah, I feel like I was included. AC: Huh? Didn't you come in on your own? AA: Actually, it feels like there's still some that my mother made for me. AC: ""Mom, you're kind! So reliable!"" AA: But quite often, I'm an easy person to deceive. AC: Is that so? AA: I think so. By the way, how about you? AC: I finally got in just one. AA: By the way, what kind of insurance is it? AC: It's hospitalization insurance. I was actually considering a savings-based one, though. AA: Hospitalization insurance! Ah, it seems necessary at this time. AC: ""Ah, how does it go with the coronavirus? Is it not covered?"" AA: How about it? But if it's excluded, that's terrible. AC: ""Hey! Have you ever been hospitalized?"" AA: ""Actually, I don't have any. I'm perfectly healthy."" AC: That's a good thing! I've only done it once. AA: Oh! Why are you hospitalized? AC: ""It was appendicitis. That's why I was able to be discharged quickly, but if it were COVID, it would have taken longer."" AA: That must have been very painful. AC: Well, but it will get better soon. If it's a hospital stay due to COVID-19, it's a few weeks, right? AA: ""That's certainly true. Well, it's a matter of whether there's even a bed in the first place."" AC: Oh, I heard that's really bad right now. AA: ""I heard it's dangerous, they said it's fully booked."" AC: ""Eek! It's too scary! I have to be really careful."" AA: ""But even if you are careful, you know."" AC: Well, I guess it's about building up basic physical strength and getting enough nutrition. AA: Let's do our best, thank you very much. AC: ""Thank you very much!"""
6,"AC: Hello. Thanks for your hard work! AA: Hello! Thank you for your hard work! AC: Were you doing anything today? AA: I went shopping today. AC: Oh! What did you buy? AA: I thought about buying vegetables, but in the end, I didn't. AC: ""Huh! Was it expensive?"" AA: ""Well, it wasn't the price I was expecting, so maybe next time."" AC: Recently, everything has been going up in price, hasn't it? AA: Really! Everything is getting expensive and it's troublesome. AC: Even now, summer vegetables should actually be cheap. AA: It seems that way, but I guess the heat was the cause after all. AC: That's very likely! By the way, do you usually cook for yourself? AA: I do it a little. AC: Great! Are you good at cooking? AA: Not at all! I'm a poor judge of taste. AC: When I cook, the seasoning inevitably becomes just for my own taste, doesn't it? AA: ""That's right. When I occasionally let my family eat it, they give me a 'What?' look."" AC: That sounds pretty nice! Don't you look at books or the internet while doing it? AA: No, it's good to use that as a reference, but if you get lazy and do it half-heartedly, you'll immediately get frowned upon. AC: Ah, I understand! How about tasting it in the middle? AA: I do it, but it tastes strange from the beginning. AC: I see. So, will you make adjustments? AA: ""When I try to adjust it, it gets even worse."" AC: I understand that a little. The way the taste is perceived changes depending on the temperature. AA: You're good at cooking, aren't you? AC: No, that's not the case. I'm completely relying on mentsuyu. AA: Mentsuyu-sama!! I understand, that person is a god. AC: ""Right! Mentsuyu is the heart of Japan!"" AA: I understand! Thank you very much!"
7,"AC: Hello! AA: Please! AC: Have you been to an amusement park lately? AA: ""I haven't said a word! Did you go?"" AC: Me neither. I want to go to places that feel like tourist spots, like Disneyland. AA: ""I want to go. They said that Disney is not crowded during COVID."" AC: I see! It's rather a good target! AA: It seems it was by appointment. Apparently, it's not like that anymore. AC: Ah, so there was a time when it was reservation-only. AA: I heard it was empty at that time. AC: ""I can't imagine an empty Disneyland!"" AA: ""Yeah, that's right! I've always wanted to go because there was always a 2-hour wait!"" AC: That's right! If we could get on without waiting in line, it looks like it would be a very fulfilling day. AA: That's right! By the way, which do you prefer, Land or Sea? AC: Actually, I have never been to Sea. AA: ""Oh, is that so?"" AC: I used to live very close by, and I was fed up with the fireworks from Disney or Sea every night. AA: Ah, I see... It was near Maihama. That's nice. AC: When it's close, my feet hesitate. But when I see it from afar, I strongly feel like going. AA: ""Oh, they say that, don't they? That locals don't go as often."" AC: Yes, yes, that's right. That's why I've never been to Tokyo Tower. AA: Oh! By the way, where do you live now? AC: Right now, I'm at the westernmost tip of Kyushu! AA: ""Did you suddenly let go?"" AC: ""It's true! When I moved away, I missed Mount Fuji so much."" AA: Is it Kagoshima or something? AC: ""It's in that direction. Sakurajima is not close by, though!"" AA: Ah! I'm going to Kagoshima in October! AC: Wow, have fun! The food in Kagoshima is delicious! AA: Eh, I'm curious! Thank you very much!"
8,"AC: Hello, nice to meet you. AA: Hello, nice to meet you. AC: By the way, do you participate in hometown tax donations? AA: ""Oh, I was thinking of doing it! Have you done it before?"" AC: There is, there is! AA: What did you receive? AC: Aladdin's toaster! AA: Wow! AC: Hey, hey, surprising, right!? AA: I'm surprised! Really? Can I get something like that? AC: Yes! I got it for 2000 yen! AA: ""No way, do you remember which city it was?"" AC: I think it was in Hyogo. Over there, they are making graphite heaters. AA: I see, by the way, is it Rakuten's hometown tax donation? AC: Yes, that's it! Exactly that! AA: ""Rakuten does everything, doesn't it?"" AC: ""Yes, I am. By chance, when I was searching with the intention of buying it normally, it came up."" AA: Wow, that's really lucky. You contributed to the country and also got Aladdin. AC: Yes! It was a great deal. Plus, I earned Rakuten points as well. AA: That's nice, Rakuten often has quite a few campaigns, don't they? My money keeps getting drained. AC: I understand! During shopping sprees, it's crazy. AA: I understand, and then there are things I want to buy after I'm done shopping around. AC: ""It's coming out—like pulling a string of potatoes."" AA: ""They come out, don't they? What is that phenomenon?"" AC: ""I am completely falling into Rakuten's trap."" AA: That's really true, Rakuten's marketing is really good. AC: I think so too. When you get a coupon with a one-day expiration date after shopping, it's like, really?! AA: I understand! Those kinds of expiration dates are so unfair! It's like they know how we feel. AC: Yes, yes! Be careful not to buy too much! AA: I want money! Thank you very much!"
9,"AC: Hello! AA: Good evening! AC: Oh, is it already that time? AA: ""I thought so."" AC: Certainly, the days have indeed become shorter recently. AA: Right, I always wonder, when is the best time to switch greetings? AC: ""Is it when the evening chime rings?"" AA: I see. So, 5 o'clock? AC: ""Right. Will the chime ring?"" AA: ""It doesn't ring on my end."" AC: Oh, is that so? Is it because there are fields and such? AA: I see! But my friend's place gets affected, doesn't it? I wonder why? AC: What is that? I feel like when I heard it as a child, I hurried home. AA: There was a curfew, huh? AC: Sure. ""Yes, that's right. When playing outside, you lose track of time."" AA: Indeed. How did we check the time back then? It's so nostalgic. AC: I just remembered, when I was a child, I used to ask strangers for the time if I didn't have a watch. AA: Ah, that did happen. Then they would normally let us know. We can't do that now. AC: That's right! People are quite on edge these days about suspicious individuals! AA: ""Yes, it is. Even if I'm just looking purely without any intentions, I'm afraid of being treated like a suspicious person."" AC: I understand. I try to be careful not to stare at children. AA: That's right. Somehow, in that sense, it has become inconvenient, hasn't it? AC: ""Yes, it used to be normal to get scolded by strangers back in the day!"" AA: Found it, found it! We were just talking normally. AC: I used to! So nostalgic. AA: Although the world has become convenient, it is equally inconvenient. AC: ""Yes. I miss the times when unknown old ladies would give us candy or tangerines."" AA: ""Yes, that happened! Without any strange meaning, we used to go to each other's houses to hang out."" AC: ""There it was. Showa era, completely Showa era!"" AA: Nostalgic, I want to go back! AC: ""Okay! See you!"""
10,"AC: Good evening, hello. AA: Good evening! AC: Have you decided on the menu for dinner tonight? AA: ""Not yet! I'm wondering what to do."" AC: ""It's a dilemma, isn't it? Which do you prefer, meat or fish?"" AA: It's a tough decision. I think I'll eat the meat. AC: Meat is delicious, isn't it! I like chicken. AA: Chicken is good, healthy and cheap. Cheap! Cheap!! AC: ""Triple cheap, got it!"" AA: I realized how important being cheap is after living alone. AC: I also felt like I always bought it because it was cheap. Especially the chicken breast. AA: Breast meat! Certainly! By the way, are you a fish person or a meat person? AC: I like grilled fish such as Pacific saury. AA: ""That's nice, I love grilled saury in the autumn."" AC: ""It's delicious, isn't it? It goes well with rice and also with beer."" AA: That's nice, it feels like an autumn table. AC: They say everything is delicious in autumn, don't they? I also have the image that there are various fruits. AA: That's certainly true, isn't it? Autumn has beautiful foliage, the Harvest Moon, and most importantly, the food is delicious! It has everything. AC: ""Ah, rice! New rice!"" AA: Newcomer!! AC: With honor! It's that delicious, isn't it! AA: ""It's delicious, isn't it! Speaking of which, I recently had some delicious (expensive) rice, and it was tastier than any white rice I've ever had."" AC: ""Eh, really! Is it branded rice?"" AA: Here it is! I bought rice from a rice shop. I don't remember the price, but I can tell in just one bite. AC: With just one sip! It changes that much! What brand is it? AA: It was Milky Queen! AC: ""Ah, that looks delicious! Was it from Hokkaido?"" AA: ""Was it? I bought it because the bag felt luxurious."" AC: I'll try buying that this fall! AA: Definitely!"
