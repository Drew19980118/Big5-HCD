1,"DH: Nice to meet you, I am <DH> currently working part-time at an accessory shop! BQ: Good evening. Is this an accessory shop? Do you make them? DH: Yes, we often make them by hand. BQ: I see. Do you have a favorite type of accessory? DH: I am skilled at making flower accessories by bending wire. BQ: ""The flower accessories are nice. Do you get a lot of customers?"" DH: Recently, due to the impact of COVID-19, there are fewer people around. BQ: That's tough. Are you happy when the accessories you made yourself sell? DH: The items sold are procured, and production is done on holidays. BQ: I see. How many years have you been working? DH: I just started this year, and there are still many things I'm not used to. BQ: You're new, right? There may be a lot to learn, but please do your best. DH: Thank you, I am learning a lot and enjoying every day. BQ: Do you have any other part-time job experience? DH: Actually, this is my first time doing a part-time job. BQ: It's your first part-time job, isn't it? It's nice that you look so fresh and innocent. DH: Thank you, I was quite busy during my university days. BQ: I've heard that studying is tough. I hope you get to experience various things from now on. DH: Yes, I want to have various experiences. Do you have any experiences that left a lasting impression? BQ: I remember helping out at my relative's sushi restaurant. DH: Is it a sushi restaurant? That's nice, it gives the impression of great craftsmanship. BQ: In reality, I only did cleaning and serving, but the staff meals were delicious. DH: ""The staff meal at the sushi restaurant looks really delicious. It's refreshing since I don't have any experience working part-time in the food and beverage industry."" BQ: Is there any job you would like to try in the future? DH: That's right, I originally wanted to pursue a job related to the medical field that I studied in university. BQ: Are you in the medical field? That's amazing. I hope you can get a job where you can utilize your learned experience. DH: Thank you, I have a gap, so I need to study. BQ: Was the practical training tough? DH: It was tough because it lasted from early morning until late at night, and I couldn't get much sleep because I also had assignments. BQ: That must have been tough. I'm glad I could hear such a valuable story."
2,"DH: Good evening, nice to meet you. BQ: Good evening. Are there any places you like in your hometown or where you currently live? DH: I think it's the food stalls! I feel like they're unique to this area. BQ: ""Is it a food stall? That's unusual. Is it the one that opens at night?"" DH: Yes, yes. It's also fun to have a lively time with strangers. BQ: That sounds good. Do you have any food recommendations? DH: It's a classic, but I recommend yakitori and ramen. Especially ramen, as there are many shops that take great care in its preparation. BQ: ""I admire ramen from food stalls. Do they also have oden?"" DH: Of course, we also have oden! The staff serves it, and it feels simple and nice. BQ: Since I watched the anime called Oden-kun a long time ago, I have been fascinated by street stall oden. DH: ""There was such an anime! I used to watch it a lot too."" BQ: I see that you watched it too, hizu. I remember it being quite interesting. DH: The silhouette was unique and interesting. BQ: The idea of talking oden is quite something, isn't it? DH: That's right, it's not really a heavily anthropomorphized feeling. BQ: Japan tends to personify everything, doesn't it? It's like there's nothing left that hasn't been personified. DH: That's right, recently the anthropomorphization of horses has also become famous. BQ: It's about Uma Musume, right? Anime culture is amazing. DH: The influence is really amazing. What surprised me the most was the personification of alcohol. BQ: There's even alcohol. I'm surprised. DH: Because anything is possible, I thought interesting things could be created. BQ: ""In foreign countries, there are restrictions due to religion and such, aren't there? In that regard, Japan is free."" DH: That's right, I feel quite free. Though not as much as in the past. BQ: I've heard that Hollywood has also become increasingly boring over the years, with various regulations being added. DH: Certainly, consideration is necessary, but recently, there have been many times when I feel it is overdone. BQ: I often hear about diversity, but I wonder if it's actually making things more suffocating. DH: I understand, there are too many regulations, and it feels suffocating. BQ: I wonder if the people involved really want it. I don't think it's something for outsiders to make a fuss about. DH: After the regulations are enforced, we often see the parties involved stating that they did not request such measures. BQ: That's right. It was a very deep conversation. Thank you very much."
3,"DH: Nice to meet you, please take care of me. CO: Thank you in advance. DH: It rained heavily in this region today. CO: ""Is it Tohoku?"" DH: I am from Kyushu. CO: Ah, I am from Kansai, but it was rainy today. DH: When I watched the weather forecast, I felt down because it looks like it will rain all week. CO: ""It's tough to have rain here, isn't it? Was it quite a heavy rain?"" DH: It wasn't raining that hard, but I forgot my umbrella at work. CO: I will definitely forget too! DH: The train's departure time was also really tight, so I couldn't go back to get it. You'd forget too, right? CO: Yes, there isn't a single one that survived for a year. DH: ""Is it really that much? After finding my favorite one, surprisingly, I haven't lost it."" CO: ""Did you lose your favorite this time?"" DH: ""I know where it is, so I plan to pick it up next time."" CO: If that's the case, it's all right then. Are there quite a lot of rain and typhoons in Kyushu as well? DH: Yes, unexpectedly there are many. There are also many that veer off course, but typhoons often pass nearby. CO: Are there any disasters? DH: When I was little, there was a fairly large earthquake, but lately, there haven't been any at all. CO: I see. My friend experienced an earthquake and flooding in Kumamoto. DH: Certainly, I feel like I often hear about Kumamoto. CO: When you think the rain isn't a big deal, you end up having a pretty bad experience. DH: There was a time when the car couldn't move due to heavy rain. It was really tough. CO: Please be careful. It comes suddenly. DH: I will be on alert because it will be problematic if the transportation stops. CO: Is transportation convenient there? DH: I live quite in the countryside, and there is only one train per hour. CO: That's quite something. Will you be traveling by car? DH: Yes, traveling by car is the main way. It's a necessity. CO: Please be careful of disasters."
4,"DH: Good evening, it's late at night, but thank you in advance. CO: ""Likewise, please take care of me."" DH: Today, while watching TV, a crab appeared and I ended up wanting to eat it. CO: That's nice. Do you like crab? DH: I love crabs. But peeling the shells is a hassle. CO: ""Don't you become silent when eating crab?"" DH: I understand, I'm eating desperately so I don't have the luxury to talk. CO: What kind of crab that you have eaten so far was the most delicious? DH: I forgot the name, but it was the crab sashimi I had when I stayed at the inn. CO: Is this a place famous for crabs? DH: I don't think it was particularly a specialty. I've never eaten it at a famous place. CO: ""I see, but I'm sure the inn has good crabs."" DH: It was really delicious. Usually, I buy cheap crab. I suddenly get the urge to eat it. CO: ""Will it be the season again soon? Crab hot pot and such."" DH: That's right, it's tastier when it gets colder, so I'm looking forward to it. CO: That's right. I've had something called Hanazakigani and it was delicious. DH: ""Was it the one with the spiky shell? It looks delicious!"" CO: Yes, it was delicious. I ate it in Hokkaido. DH: Hokkaido! That must be absolutely delicious. The other seafood looks tasty too. CO: ""It's delicious. Hokkaido's seafood bowls were tasty."" DH: That's nice, a seafood bowl. I had some from the market the other day and it was really delicious. CO: Sounds good. Do you like sashimi? DH: I love sashimi too. I prefer sushi over meat. CO: ""Today, I actually had freshly caught bonito and tuna."" DH: ""Is that freshly caught? I'm very envious!"" CO: It was delicious. DH: I've started craving it so much, I think I'll go somewhere tomorrow. CO: Sounds good. We still have some tuna at home, so I'd like to share it with you. DH: I would definitely love to have a share! I'm getting hungry! CO: I ended up boasting. I'm sorry."
5,"DH: Good evening, thank you in advance. CO: Good evening, nice to meet you. DH: What do you usually do on your days off? CO: Usually, I do DIY or cycling. DH: Quite an outdoorsy feeling! CO: Yes, I like it quite a bit. DH: ""I am extremely indoorsy, so this is refreshing."" CO: I see. What are you doing at home? DH: ""Making accessories and making sweets, I guess."" CO: Wow, what kind of accessories are they? DH: ""There are many piercings, and I use wire to make things like flowers."" CO: ""You're quite skillful. Is it for yourself?"" DH: Yes, it's for personal use. I sometimes sell on flea market apps. CO: ""That's a nice hobby. I respect people who can do handmade crafts."" DH: Thank you very much, but it is really just a hobby. CO: ""Is that so? I bought a handmade wallet that someone made on Yahoo Auctions."" DH: Lately, there are a lot of handmade items, aren't there? I see them often too. CO: ""I like it because it's unique. What kind of sweets do you make?"" DH: I'm good at making scones! They taste even better with chocolate. CO: ""It's delicious. My family made it once. I also made oatmeal cookies a while ago."" DH: Oatmeal cookies are nice, they seem good for health too. CO: Yes. It's for your health, right? Are you good with your hands? DH: I think I'm quite dexterous because my work involves a lot of detailed tasks. CO: I'm envious. Even though it's indoors, it feels like it has a sense of style. DH: I'm very pleased with your compliment! I've been doing this often since I was little. CO: Do handmade items sell well? DH: Since you are a beginner, if you set the price lower, it will sell surprisingly well! CO: Wow, it seems like your dreams are expanding. I hope you can make something great. DH: It's fun to tinker on my day off! CO: I am envious. Thank you for today."
6,"DH: Good evening, nice to meet you. CI: Good evening! Please take care of me! DH: It's still hot, isn't it? The air conditioner is working hard. CI: Me too. I almost always leave it on. DH: If you don't have more than an hour to turn it off, it seems that it's more economical that way. CI: That's right, I've heard that too, so I turn it on before it gets hot in the morning. DH: I think it's a good idea! It would be terrible if someone got heatstroke. CI: The heat in Japan in recent years feels life-threatening. DH: I think I can't stay outside anymore. CI: I understand, the heat when you step outside makes you think there must be some mistake, right? DH: I travel a lot by car, but the interior of the car also gets dusty. CI: Ah, cars can be troublesome. I often hear that the steering wheel gets hot too. DH: ""It's incredibly hot. I always use the supermarket as a summer retreat."" CI: The supermarket is really chilly, isn't it? Especially around the refrigerated sections. DH: It is very cool. I will go for nothing anymore. CI: Even if I don't have anything to buy, I sometimes leave the station and cool off before heading home. DH: You end up stopping by, don't you? Cool places are the best. CI: I ended up buying some ice cream while I was at it. DH: Ice cream is nice. I also end up eating it almost every day. CI: Do you have any recommendations for recent ice creams? DH: Yes, I like an ice cream called ""Bakichoco."" CI: ""Baki Choco, I'm curious!"" DH: The chocolate is thicker than a chocolate bar and it's in there just like that. It's delicious. CI: The chocolate as it is, that's nice! DH: Yes, it has more satisfaction than the chocolate flavor. CI: When it's this hot, it's easier to eat chocolate chunks than something creamy and rich. DH: ""That's true, sherbet-type is also nice."" CI: I also often buy sherbet recently. DH: I like whole mandarin oranges. CI: I also like fruit sherbet!"
7,"DH: Good evening, nice to meet you! CI: ""Likewise, I look forward to working with you!"" DH: What is your favorite food? CI: The first thing that came to mind is salted mackerel. DH: Is it salted mackerel? That's quite refined. CI: ""It might be relatively astringent. Do you have any favorite foods?"" DH: ""Sushi, I could eat it every day for a week."" CI: Sushi sounds good. I like fish too. DH: Especially, I really love shrimp. CI: Shrimp is nice, isn't it? Do you prefer sweet shrimp or boiled shrimp? DH: I like boiled ones. Especially red shrimp. CI: The plump shrimp, that's nice! DH: Talking about it made me want to eat it. CI: Me too. I'm starting to crave shrimp tempura as well. DH: ""Tempura sounds good. It's hard to make when it's hot."" CI: Fried food is tough during this season, isn't it? I want to eat at a restaurant. DH: I want to eat it with cold udon. CI: Ah, udon and a set. Tomorrow's lunch is decided. DH: I might do that too, I really want to eat. CI: My stomach feels like it can only accept that now. DH: Once you decide, you just have to have it, right? CI: ""That's right, I can't see anything else."" DH: At times like that, I can't find it and I get depressed. CI: Ah, that's tough. My mouth is already in noodle soup mode. DH: When I eat something completely different, I somehow don't find it tasty. CI: ""I feel an overwhelming sense of dissatisfaction. I don't think I'll be satisfied until I eat tempura and udon."" DH: That's right. I'll eat it even if I have to force myself. CI: I already started imagining the route for going out tomorrow. DH: That's quick! CI: Talking about food at this time is dangerous because it makes me hungry. Thank you for the conversation!"
8,"DH: Thank you in advance. AD: Thank you in advance! DH: It was somehow hot today, wasn't it? AD: Is that so? I don't go outside during the day, so I don't know. DH: The news also mentioned to be careful of heatstroke. AD: It was that hot, huh? I was out this weekend and thought it was hot. DH: It seems it will suddenly get cold again from the day after tomorrow! AD: This time of year, it's hard to decide what to wear because it can be hot or cold. DH: Right! Even though I already put away my short-sleeved clothes. AD: However, I haven't taken out the autumn and winter clothes yet, so I'm keeping the short-sleeved ones. DH: I see! I've finished changing out my wardrobe. AD: ""The earlier the better. On the other hand, I'm having trouble with the cold at night."" DH: ""It's the time when I'm wondering whether to take out the feathers."" AD: ""A down comforter, huh. I hadn't thought about that at all since I'm still using the air conditioner when I sleep."" DH: I see! I haven't been using the air conditioner. AD: When I open the window, bugs come in, so I absolutely can't. I set a timer to have it on for just one hour. DH: It's the season for bugs to come out, I saw a centipede yesterday as well. AD: ""Is it a centipede? I really can't handle any insects, so I absolutely don't want to open the window."" DH: I'm not good with bugs either. I managed somehow because my parents were there. AD: It helps to have someone who is okay with bugs. DH: That's right! It's really impossible. AD: When I was living alone, I was really helpless and troubled. DH: Understood! I was just hoping it wouldn't come out. AD: I want to live in a high-rise apartment where bugs don't appear. DH: Sounds good! I want to live there. AD: It seems that mosquitoes don't come up to around the 10th floor. DH: ""Is that so? I'm prone to being bitten, so that's good."" AD: If I had money, I would like to live in the more expensive apartment. DH: ""That's right! It's a dream because I don't have any money."" AD: Me too. I have big dreams."
9,"DH: Please. AD: Thank you in advance. DH: Do you have any favorite foods? AD: I love fruit. DH: Sounds good! It's just the right season. AD: Yes, let's see. Right now, things like pears and grapes. DH: Grapes are nice! I love them! AD: Shine Muscat grapes are delicious, aren't they? They're a bit expensive, though. DH: That's nice! But it's expensive. AD: Do you often eat fruit? DH: I eat it every day! Because I like it. AD: Sounds good! What do you eat every day? DH: There are a lot of mandarins. AD: Are mandarins already available? DH: House-grown mandarins are already available. AD: That’s early. In about two months, I’ll probably receive some mandarins from a friend. DH: ""That's nice! Are you a farmer?"" AD: ""That is not the case, but even though they live in Okayama, for some reason they send me Ehime mandarin oranges every year."" DH: I see, that's great! AD: The mandarins from Ehime were very sweet and delicious. I can't eat the ones sold at the supermarket anymore. DH: Is that so! I want to try it, but it's a bit scary. AD: Are you scared? DH: It seems like I won't be able to eat anything else. AD: It is there. It's so sweet that I really can't eat it. I just wait for it to be delivered every year. DH: It looks really delicious. AD: However, I feel sorry that when I receive them in a box, one or two inevitably get damaged. DH: I see, so much that you can't finish it. AD: Last year, 20 kilograms were sent. DH: It was more amazing than I expected!! AD: It was quite an incredible amount."
10,"DH: Thank you in advance. GY: Please! DH: Have you already had dinner? GY: Not yet! DH: I see! What are the plans? GY: I'm thinking of grilling some chicken! DH: That's great! I like it! GY: ""It's delicious, isn't it? Although it's simple."" DH: ""Even if it's cheap, it's still delicious, which is great, isn't it?"" GY: Okay. Have you already eaten dinner? DH: Yes! It was shrimp with chili sauce. GY: That's nice! Did you make it yourself? DH: No, no, my mother does it because I live at home. GY: That's nice! Do you have any desire to live alone? DH: Living alone is nice. It was like that when I was a university student. GY: ""So you have returned!"" DH: That's right! I miss living alone. GY: It happens like that, doesn't it! DH: I realized that time alone is important. GY: I understand! But it costs money, right? DH: That's right, being able to save money is a good thing about living with parents. GY: ""That's for sure. I don't have enough money left for savings."" DH: ""Somehow, I'm worried if I'll receive my pension properly."" GY: ""It's suspicious in today's world."" DH: I think I need to save money, but it's difficult and I'm stuck. GY: I understand. But on the other hand, investing is also scary. DH: That's right, I'm interested but I lack the necessary knowledge. GY: It is the same. DH: I think I'll try starting little by little. GY: Maybe I should try studying too."
