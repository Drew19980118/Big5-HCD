1,"GS: Hello. Nice to meet you. CH: Hello, nice to meet you. GS: Do you have any hobbies or special skills? CH: Cooking and reading are my hobbies. Recently, I've been enjoying games as well. GS: Cooking is nice, but I'm not very good at it. CH: I enjoy making the things I want to eat. GS: ""Also, I heard you play games; specifically, what kind of games do you play?"" CH: I am currently playing a game called Elden Ring. I play it on my PC. GS: I've heard of it. I also play games occasionally, but they are mostly simulations. CH: I see, there are various types of simulations from city-building to strategy and combat. GS: That's right, I have played a city-building game called ""Let's Go by A Train."" CH: ""Is it the A-Train? I haven't played it, but I generally understand its content."" GS: Is that so? It's fun because you can make it quite faithfully according to the actual town. CH: Nowadays, unlike the past, we calculate various factors, so it can be enjoyable no matter how many times you do it, right? GS: That's right, in the past, there were quite a few simple things. CH: ""Yes. Still, I was having fun playing back then."" GS: By the way, do you know a simulator game called Train Simulator GO!? CH: ""I know. My friend even bought a dedicated controller, so I got to play it."" GS: Is that so? I played so much that I even considered buying a dedicated controller. CH: At first, I splendidly overran and made the passengers fall. GS: The G-sensor deducts quite a bit, so it's tough to apply the brakes correctly, isn't it? CH: Yes, that’s right. Stopping in a way that takes the long inertia into account was difficult. GS: There are people who stop exactly at 0cm on YouTube, which is amazing, isn't it? CH: ""It's interesting to watch things like that, isn't it? Like when you let an old man who used to be a professional do it, and he was super good at it."" GS: Certainly, I'd like to see that. I've heard that Shinkansen drivers have particularly advanced skills. CH: Recently, VR has advanced, so train and flight simulations might be even more interesting with VR. GS: I haven't played many flight games, but I think I would like to try them someday. CH: I am more into combat aircraft than flights, but I used to play those kinds of games quite a lot. GS: ""Is it a fighter jet game? I used to play it occasionally too."" CH: I see. The control system might be the most enjoyable aspect of the game's evolution."
2,"GS: Hello. Nice to meet you. CH: Hello, nice to meet you. GS: I travel quite a lot as a hobby; do you often go on trips? CH: ""I don't travel more than most people, but I do go on trips occasionally. Have you been anywhere recently?"" GS: Yes, in August, I went to Tokyo and Yokohama. CH: It's an urban area, isn't it? Tokyo is a city, but it also has many temples and shrines. GS: I like to see beautiful night views, so I went to the city with my friend. We didn't really see many temples or shrines. CH: I see. So, you viewed the night scenery from a tall building, right? GS: Yes, I have booked all the hotel rooms on the 30th floor or higher. CH: Oh, you are thorough. Speaking of tall things, I lived in a place where I could see the Sky Tree during its construction. GS: Did you live in Tokyo? I'm a bit envious because I'm from the countryside. CH: After it was completed, I thought I could go anytime, but I ended up moving in the meantime. GS: So, have you never been to the Skytree? CH: I see. No, I didn't go inside to the observatory. I watched it from the outside the whole time. GS: I see. You should go at least once. The elevator is also faster than anything I've ever experienced. CH: The elevators in skyscrapers are amazing, aren't they? GS: Do you know Yokohama Landmark Tower? Apparently, the descending elevator is the fastest in the world. CH: The elevator at Landmark Tower is really impressive. No matter how many times I ride it, it always feels fast. GS: Actually, when I went on a trip in August and rode it for the first time, I was really surprised. CH: ""The elevator is more of a landmark than the building itself."" GS: Certainly, that's true. Have you ever stayed at the Royal Park Hotel inside? CH: ""I have never stayed there. Did you stay there during your trip?"" GS: Yes, I stayed there this time, and since the guest rooms are on the 52nd floor and above, it felt like staying at the observation deck. CH: Aha, that sounds nice. I'd love to look at it while having a drink. GS: Moreover, the price is quite reasonable, you can stay for about 8000 yen per person without meals. CH: Oh, it's unexpectedly cheap. Could it be because the number of customers is decreasing? GS: I don't think that's the case, when I went there, there were an incredible number of people even though it was a weekday. CH: I see, if it's bustling then that's great. The tourism industry has been going through a tough time these past couple of years. GS: ""Yes, it's hard to hear the news that the inn we stayed at before is closing."" CH: Indeed. I want to return to previous levels soon."
3,"GS: Hello! DF: Hello! GS: What did you have for dinner? DF: I went to Saizeriya. GS: Oh, nice! I went to Saizeriya last week too! DF: Is that so! Are there any dishes you often eat? GS: I am having a hamburger! How about you? DF: Recently, I've been into young chicken prepared diavolo style. GS: ""Oh, my friend had that before! Is it really delicious?"" DF: The gym trainer told me it's good because I can get protein, so I tried eating it and it was delicious! GS: I see! You exercise at the gym! DF: Yes, I go to personal training once a week. GS: When I was a student, I used to exercise, but now I hardly do any exercise at all. DF: I see. What did you do during your student days? GS: ""I did track and field for six years."" DF: ""Track and field! What event do you participate in?"" GS: The main events were the 100m and 200m sprints! DF: You're fast at running! That's cool and I'm jealous! GS: There were many fast people around, so I couldn't really excel within the group. DF: ""It is a star event, and there are many rivals."" GS: That's right, it was quite difficult to reach the finals. DF: I see. But it's amazing that you've been able to keep it up for 6 years! GS: I started in my first year of junior high and kept doing it until I began studying for entrance exams in my third year of high school! DF: Continuing is wonderful! Why did you choose the track and field club? GS: When I was in 6th grade, there was a small track and field meet, and I did well, so my teacher recommended it to me. DF: I see! So, you have been participating in record meetings since elementary school! GS: I was allowed to participate because I could run a little faster than others! DF: I was always one of the last, so I'm really envious... GS: I see, it can't be helped because everyone has strengths and weaknesses. DF: Is that so? Thank you for the enjoyable conversation!"
4,"GS: Good evening! Nice to meet you. DF: Thank you in advance! GS: What do you do on your days off? DF: I often relax at home. Like watching videos and such! GS: Do you watch things like YouTube? DF: That's right! I also play the Switch. GS: Ah, I see! Do you play games quite a bit too? DF: ""I do it when I feel like it, but there are quite a few that I bought and haven't done."" GS: I see. I tend to play simulation games. DF: ""Are simulation games the kind that you play in a relaxed and leisurely manner?"" GS: The game I'm playing is one where you drive a train. You can take your time if you want. DF: ""I see! I understand what it's like! I often play RPGs."" GS: ""I see! There are various types of games, after all."" DF: Sure! What do you do on your days off? GS: These days, I often go to karaoke to practice singing. DF: ""Is it karaoke? You like singing, don't you!"" GS: Yes! I often use precise scoring! DF: Wow, amazing! I definitely want to listen to it once! GS: ""I'm not that good, I'm struggling to improve my scores. The grading is quite strict."" DF: ""The machine is strict, isn't it..."" GS: It seems that it has become more difficult to get a higher score than before, as new models have been introduced in the past few years. DF: I see! Karaoke is evolving rapidly, isn't it! GS: I hope that someday it will have scoring skills as good as a human! DF: ""That would be amazing if that happens! What genre of songs do you sing?"" GS: I sing songs by Ayaka, JUJU, and Spitz. DF: ""That looks difficult! It would be cool if you could sing it well!"" GS: Ayaka's ""Mikazuki"" is one of my specialities, so I'm working hard to sing it even better! DF: ""It's a good song, isn't it? It's great that you have a favorite song!!"" GS: Yes! It's fun to sing! DF: I feel like going to karaoke!"
5,"GS: Good evening! Please! DF: Please! GS: When you were in elementary school, did you take any lessons or participate in any activities? DF: I went to piano lessons, calligraphy classes, and cram school! Also, softball! GS: Oh! I also took piano and calligraphy lessons! DF: ""It's the same for me. I'm glad I learned piano and calligraphy."" GS: I understand. I've been really feeling lately how important it is to have beautiful handwriting. DF: That's right! I feel like I naturally learned to write beautifully because I went to calligraphy classes. GS: You mentioned that you also played the piano, so for how many years did you play? DF: I have been learning piano from the age of 3 until I graduated from junior high school, so it's over 10 years. GS: Amazing! Then you're quite skilled, right? DF: No, that's not the case. I used to accompany during chorus performances. GS: If you can accompany, I think you are good enough! DF: Is that so? Even now, I like songs without vocals, so maybe I just liked the accompaniment. GS: But it's nice to be able to play accompaniment. I only play solos. DF: Do you still play now? GS: ""I play occasionally. It's an electric piano, but since it's at my parents' house, I play it when I go back."" DF: Sounds good! I can't at all right now... GS: When you become busy, you don't have many opportunities to play, right... DF: Well, I'm not even sure if I can read sheet music now... GS: I see, I'm also not good at reading sheet music. DF: Does it feel like you remember with your ears and eyes? GS: ""It's more like I've played it many times and memorized it with my hands."" DF: I see! Practice makes perfect, doesn't it! GS: Yes! I feel like I've improved by repeatedly practicing various things since long ago! DF: I think it's wonderful that you can put in such effort! GS: No, not at all. Well, I can continue because it's something I like! DF: It's nice to have things you enjoy, isn't it? It gives you more things to look forward to. GS: Yes! Certainly, the things to look forward to have really increased! DF: Sounds good! Well then, thank you for the conversation!"
6,"GS: Good evening! Please! FE: Good evening! Thank you, and I look forward to working with you! GS: What did you do today? FE: I went to the lab as usual today. GS: Is it university research? FE: That's right! I am a student. GS: I am also a student! Are you in science? FE: That's right! How about you? GS: I am also a science major! Engineering, right? FE: Oh, I am in the field of science! We are similar. GS: That's right! I'm still on summer vacation and will start classes next week. FE: I see! The second semester at my school started today. GS: Is that so! It's about a week off. FE: Maybe you started summer vacation late? GS: It was around August 6th. How about there? FE: It was about the same here! It seems like your university has a longer summer vacation. GS: However, I think the spring break is a bit short! It's strange if there is no compensation. FE: That's right! Are there a set number of classes per lesson? GS: Sure! Here is the translated sentence:

""That's right! It's already decided. How about you?"" FE: Yes! It's decided to be 16 frames. GS: I see! The location of the university I attend is very bad. How is it over there? FE: That's tough. My place is about a 15-minute walk from the nearest station! GS: That sounds nice! Our university is like a lone house in the countryside. FE: Wow. How do you get through? GS: It's so rural that I commute from the neighboring city, and it takes a little over an hour by train and bus. FE: ""That's tough! Is that your parents' house?"" GS: No, it's not my family home. I'm renting an apartment! FE: The commute time from the boarding house is too much. GS: But because I can do various things during travel time, it helps a lot! FE: Certainly, it's by bus and train, right? It seems like it could be utilized effectively."
7,"GS: Please! FE: Please! GS: ""Do you have any special skills?"" FE: I'm not sure if it's a special skill, but I can play the trombone! GS: Oh! Amazing! I can only play the piano when it comes to instruments... FE: ""I admire people who can play the piano. I took lessons until second grade, but I can't play anymore."" GS: Does it feel like something from a long time ago? FE: That’s right. I remember quitting because my fingers were short. GS: If your fingers are short, it's quite difficult to play octaves, isn't it? FE: That's right! I couldn't play the octave piece, and I thought it was all over. GS: ""There are a lot of difficult pieces, right? What kind of pieces did you play?"" FE: I played it when I was little, so I couldn't play something like Chopin, but I played pieces like Beyer. GS: Ah, I used to play too! But recently, I stopped playing classical music entirely. FE: I see! What have you been playing recently? GS: There is a lot of J-POP! FE: Oh! What kind of music do you play? GS: Recently, it's ""Summer""! Joe Hisaishi's. FE: Oh! I know it! That's great! GS: Yes! And then there are songs like ""Bokunote"" by Sukima Switch and ""Yesterday"" by Hige Dandism. FE: Oh! I love Higedan! Isn't ""Yesterday"" quite difficult? GS: ""It's insanely difficult! Do you know the YouTuber named CANACANA?"" FE: I know! GS: I was trying to play exactly what that person arranged. FE: Wow. Uh, isn't this too difficult? GS: ""It's too difficult. I managed to play all of it eventually, but then I gave up..."" FE: No, it's too difficult. It's impressive that you even tried. GS: No, no. If I had a little more time, I might have worked harder on the second one. FE: No, no, it’s amazing! What are you practicing now? GS: I don't have a piano at home right now, so I haven't been able to make much progress. FE: Oh! I see! I hope you can do it again!"
8,"GS: Please! FE: Please! GS: Do you have a smartphone, iPhone or Android? FE: It's an iPhone! GS: Oh, really? Same here! FE: I've been using an iPhone for a long time. Once you start using an iPhone, you just stick with it. GS: That's right! I used to be an Android user, but once I switched to iPhone, I couldn't go back. FE: I've never used Android, but what are the major differences? GS: Maybe it was because the Android I was using was bad, but the snappiness is completely different! FE: Is that so! As the iPhone models get newer, they are becoming more smooth and responsive. GS: Oh, really! Since I haven't had the iPhone for long, I haven't had much experience with older models. FE: I see! Well, I've been using it since iPhone 6, and it's quite different. GS: Is that so! The screen size is quite different, isn't it? FE: That's not right! The more recent it is, the bigger it gets. Except for SE. GS: I believe they've been about the same size since around ten, right? FE: That's right! I'm 11, but using it with one hand is quite difficult. GS: I understand. When you use only one hand, it seems like you'll lose balance and drop it. FE: That's right. That's why a ring might be necessary, but I have some resistance to wearing a ring. GS: ""Even I don't wear rings. There is some resistance to it, right?"" FE: ""I used it once, but it actually became more difficult to use."" GS: It's better not to wear that anymore. Even more so now. FE: That's right. Recently, there was an update for the iPhone, wasn't there? GS: ""Oh, there it is! It's iOS16, right?"" FE: That's right! It feels like it's become even more user-friendly after the update. GS: ""I understand! It's nice that the lock screen can also be a slideshow!"" FE: That's right! Personally, I think it's great that you can change the type of font. GS: Ah, that's nice! It's great that you can change the watch face! FE: Yes! Also, I feel like Siri's voice has changed, what do you think? GS: Oh, personally I thought it was good! FE: As I thought, it has changed! I think it's nice too!"
9,"GS: Good evening! FE: Good evening!! GS: Do you listen to music often? FE: I hear that often! GS: What kind of genre is it? FE: I listen to J-POP, and since I play in an orchestra, I also listen to classical music! GS: Oh! What kind of J-POP do you listen to? Do you have any favorite bands? FE: I love Higedan! Also, Mr. Children! GS: Oh, I really like Mr. Children! FE: I see! Have you ever been to a live concert? GS: ""I haven't been. I would like to go someday, though."" FE: Me too. GS: ""Do you have any favorite songs by Mr. Children?"" FE: ""Yes, I like the monologues we share together."" GS: Ah, that song is great, isn't it! I like HANABI, it's a classic! FE: 'HANABI is great, isn't it! I also watched the drama, and every time I hear it, I feel like crying.' GS: It was the theme song of a drama, wasn't it? Do you remember which drama it was? FE: ""Is it a code blue?"" GS: Ah, I remember now! Isn't it Code Blue? FE: Oh, I made a mistake. Haha. GS: No, no. I often get the names of dramas wrong too. FE: Do you watch dramas lately? GS: ""Recently, I haven't been watching it. But I did watch Galileo the other day since it was on TV."" FE: I don't watch TV either. I mostly only watch YouTube. That sounds great! I've been wanting to see it for a long time. GS: The pair of Masaharu Fukuyama and Kou Shibasaki is quite good! FE: I see! Isn't there going to be a movie soon? GS: Ah, that's right! Was it Silent Parade? FE: Yes! I've been curious about it. GS: Why don't you try going to the movie theater? FE: I think I'll give it a try!"
10,"GS: Please! FE: Please!! GS: What model of computer are you using? FE: It's Windows! How about you? GS: I also use Windows! I seriously considered switching to Mac, though. FE: I see! Mac is cool and I admire it. GS: ""Isn't that right? I'm also imagining that it runs more smoothly than Windows."" FE: It feels similar to the iPhone. There's an impression that it moves smoothly when opening windows! GS: Ah, that's great! I'm such a fan of iPhones that I think they are really good. FE: I had a chance to use it once, and as expected, the screen was beautiful and it was great! GS: ""The screen is beautiful, isn't it? On the other hand, are there any inconveniences?"" FE: Windows is easier to modify, whereas Mac cannot do such things. GS: Ah, I see. But it's harder for viruses to get in because it's harder to modify, right? FE: That's right! Since I install a lot of applications in the lab, I appreciate having Windows. GS: ""So there are such advantages! I guess it has its pros and cons."" FE: ""That’s how it is. I'm doing research in the field of physics, and almost everyone uses Windows."" GS: I am also a science major, but I have started to wonder if Windows was the right choice after all. FE: I see! But when using an iPad, syncing issues make me think a Mac would be better! GS: Since synchronization can be done with the iPhone as well, it must be the best. I admire it! FE: It's the best, isn't it? Above all, being able to airdrop is great! GS: It's really great that the quality of photos and videos doesn't drop at all! FE: Currently, I send it once through LINE and then go from there, so the image quality has dropped considerably. GS: That's right. Actually, when I tried to send the night view the other day, the image quality became really poor on LINE and I was shocked. FE: Night views are all about image quality, right? It's okay as long as I send it in ORIGINAL quality. GS: ""Even with the ORIGINAL, does the image quality not deteriorate?"" FE: ""Oh, is that so?!"" GS: The other day it dropped! From 12 million to around 8 million. FE: ""It falls quite a bit! I didn't know..."" GS: That's right. I'm shocked. FE: ""The theory that AirDrop is the strongest is emerging."""
