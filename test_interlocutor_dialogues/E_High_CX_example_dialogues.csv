1,"CX: Hello! Nice to meet you! BU: Hello! Please! CX: How is the weather there today? BU: It's still sunny now. CX: I see, it's also clear weather here today. BU: The forecast says it's going to rain, but do you think a typhoon is coming? CX: I saw it on the news. I hope it doesn't come. BU: Will the typhoon hit? CX: Actually, I'm in Hokkaido, so I haven't received that kind of information yet. BU: By the time it gets around there, it will already have disappeared. It seems like there are fewer typhoons in Hokkaido. CX: That's right. We don't usually get much impact from typhoons. BU: ""Sounds good. The humidity doesn't seem too high either."" CX: This year, it's been raining a lot and it's pretty humid. BU: I see. If you come to Honshu, it will be even hotter. CX: I went to Tokyo at the beginning of July this year, and it was too hot. BU: That's right. When you return from Hokkaido, the moment you get off the plane it really hits you, doesn't it? CX: Yes. The moment I landed at Haneda, it felt stuffy. BU: The temperature is also a factor, but it's mostly the humidity. CX: When it's humid, the discomfort index goes up and it's unpleasant, right? BU: That's right. I don't mind it at all as long as it's dry. CX: When the weather is dry and there is a moderate breeze, it feels cool, doesn't it? BU: That's right. This season, Hokkaido seems really comfortable to live in, which is nice. CX: It's often said, but recently Hokkaido has been quite hot. BU: I see. But compared to here, I've only been there once, so I'd like to go again. CX: Certainly, it's better compared to the Honshu region. BU: I think it's quite an improvement. CX: On the contrary, I want to go over there in winter. BU: I hate winter, so I don't like anywhere. CX: I see. Then winter must be tough. BU: Yes, it's spicy. Thank you very much!"
2,"CX: Nice to meet you. What are your hobbies and interests? BU: Sure! Music, right? CX: ""Music? I like it too. What kind of music do you like?"" BU: ""Is it about your favorite genre?"" CX: ""Whether it's a genre, a song, or an instrument."" BU: I listen to anything. I like songs and instrumentals, and I also like playing instruments. CX: ""You like all genres, don't you? What is your favorite right now?"" BU: I wonder what it is. I like 90s music. CX: ""That's great! Nostalgic melodies! I like them too!"" BU: What do you like? CX: The first thing that came to mind was Kome Kome Club. BU: ""That's nice. So nostalgic."" CX: I often went to concerts after they disbanded and reformed, not in real time. BU: You like it that much, huh? CX: Once I went on a whim, I got hooked on the fun of concerts. BU: Living is good, isn't it? I haven't been able to go at all recently. CX: Since the pandemic started, concerts and other events have been canceled, making it difficult to attend them, right? BU: That’s also true. CX: When one member takes a break, it somehow feels a bit off. BU: I see. Nowadays, everyone can have a good environment at home for listening, rather than live. CX: Certainly. If the level of audio equipment and VR improves, it might be that we don't need to go out of our way anymore. BU: ""Indeed. Still, I understand the appeal of live performances. Festivals are nice during this season."" CX: That's right. But it's tough when performers cancel on the day of the festival. BU: It's unfortunate for the people who were looking forward to that artist. But the person themselves is suffering the most. CX: That's right. And that's also why it's difficult to attend live performances that are far away. BU: When it’s far away, expenses add up besides just the ticket cost. CX: It's true. It's too painful to spend a lot of money only to find out that the artist isn't there. BU: Indeed. That is tough. Let's enjoy the festival itself. CX: That's right. At a festival, you can enjoy artists other than your favorites as well. BU: Yes. It was fun. Thank you very much!"
3,"CX: Hello. How is the COVID-19 situation over there? BU: Hello. Are you asking about the infection situation around our area? CX: The situation in your area, such as the number of infections. BU: I don't watch the news about corona anymore. Even if I watch it, nothing changes. CX: I see. That might be a good thing. I tend to notice it. BU: ""Even if I'm not conscious of it, it's always being reported. I don't mind it anymore."" CX: Yes, that's right. It's not good to let it affect your mental health by worrying too much. BU: That's right. I think it would be okay as long as I don't cause trouble for others when I'm infected. CX: Certainly. If you take preventive measures yourself, there's nothing else you can do about it. BU: Okay. Let's stop talking about COVID!! CX: Understood. Is there any news that you are interested in right now? Preferably something positive. BU: I see. Are you referring to the fact that the Chunichi Dragons won yesterday? CX: You like baseball, don't you? I'm a Giants fan though. Sorry. BU: No, no, not at all. I'm just a baseball fan who supports the Chunichi Dragons. CX: Thank you very much. Ohno was amazing yesterday, wasn't he? BU: Thank you for knowing. It's a shame about the Giants. CX: The pitching staff is not very good, so we tend to lose close games. BU: Pitcher Hirauchi. Let's do our best. As for the Giants, I'm cheering for Walker and Nakayama. CX: That's right, if the players around there perform well and then Okamoto gets back in form. BU: ""Okamoto was removed from the fourth position. Nakata is doing well right now."" CX: Okamoto is in quite bad shape. Yesterday, Nakata hit a home run. Quite a contrast. BU: ""He has improved since the game against Chunichi. Nakata was really cool."" CX: I am very humbled, but I think it is quite good to be able to hit a home run off Rydel. BU: ""This is the first home run of the year. Amazing. Nakata is great too, but that was just poor battery performance."" CX: I see, the catcher's lead is also a concern for us. BU: Many commentators are saying that Kinotaku's leadership is not good this year. CX: I see. You really want a good catcher, don't you? BU: Yes, that's right. Even if they can't hit or lead well, I want a catcher who can win. CX: I want a catcher like Yakult's Nakamura. BU: ""Player Nakamura is a good player, isn't he? It feels like his performance dropped a bit after his jersey number changed. Thank you!"""
4,"CX: Thank you in advance. Are there any long holidays like the Obon holiday? BU: ""Please. There's nothing in particular! Do you have anything??"" CX: I see. I don't have anything in particular either. BU: Are you off today? CX: I'm on a break. Actually, I've lost my job due to COVID-19, so I'm off every day. BU: It must have been tough. Are you looking for a new job now? CX: I see. But I have a little bit of leeway, so I feel like I'll take my time job hunting while studying a bit as well. BU: ""I think it's good to go at your own pace. Do you have any preferences for the type of work you want to do?"" CX: Thank you very much. I am considering taking some time to think it over thoroughly, including that aspect. BU: I see. What kind of work did you do at your previous job? CX: I used to be a TV assistant director. BU: ""Are you AD? You're a TV person, right? Is it in Tokyo?"" CX: Yes. I did it in Tokyo. BU: Did you work for a famous TV company? CX: Since it's a production company, I don't think you can tell from the company name. BU: I see. Who is the most famous person you have ever met? CX: If we worked together, then it's probably Banana Man who is famous now. BU: ""That's amazing. I love comedians, so I'm jealous."" CX: I see. Banana Man is indeed kind and funny. BU: You appear on various TV shows. People who are genuine are wonderful. CX: Yes. But Mr. Himura is quite quiet during break time. BU: I have the impression that there are many talents like that. CX: Mr. Shitara makes small jokes even during breaks. BU: It looks like it's going to be a fun site. CX: ""It's fun. It's really bustling and lively."" BU: If the atmosphere is good, it seems like it will be a good program. CX: That's right. It was really tough when I joined a show where the staff didn't get along at all. BU: Wow. That's tough. That kind of thing is conveyed to the viewers as well. CX: I'm doing my best to prevent that from happening. BU: Since it's best to do things enjoyably, right? Thank you very much!"
5,"CX: Hello. Do you have any plans for today or tomorrow? BU: Hello. Not particularly! Do you have any plans? CX: I don't have anything either. I feel like just relaxing. BU: Sounds good. Have you eaten rice? CX: I'm thinking about having lunch in a little while. BU: Have you already decided what to eat? CX: ""Pork shabu-shabu, right?"" BU: ""How luxurious!"" CX: No, I just boil pork and bean sprouts. BU: ""Do you make the broth from scratch?"" CX: Not at all. You just need to put it in hot water. BU: When I heard ""shabu-shabu"", I imagined the image of shabu-shabu from a restaurant. CX: I see. I just have an image of boiling water and adding meat and vegetables. BU: That is also delicious. Is it ponzu? CX: ""They sell something called grated daikon radish sauce, and I pour it on."" BU: Is it the one with grated daikon radish mixed with ponzu sauce? CX: ""Is that what it's like? It doesn't have much of a ponzu flavor, though."" BU: ""It's refreshing and delicious, isn't it? Do you like grated daikon radish?"" CX: I like grated radish, but not enough to grate it myself. BU: It's a hassle to do it myself, so I'll buy the pre-grated one. CX: That's right. Occasionally, eating grilled fish with grated daikon and soy sauce is exceptional. BU: Grated daikon radish and soy sauce are the best combination for Atka mackerel. CX: Sounds good! I imagine grated daikon and soy sauce taste better with fatty fish. BU: ""It's delicious, isn't it? I don't get many opportunities to eat grilled fish at home, so I start craving it."" CX: ""Well, I only eat at nearby set meal restaurants occasionally."" BU: The fish at the set meal restaurant is delicious, isn't it? I'm getting hungry. CX: What are you planning to have for lunch? BU: I don't usually eat lunch, so it's extra. CX: I see. Have a great day. BU: Yes, thank you very much! Bye!"
6,"CX: Hello. Is it hot over there? CO: Hello, yes, it is hot. CX: Are you okay with heatstroke and such? CO: No, I'm being careful because it's scary. CX: It's important. Please take something cold and take care. CO: Thank you very much. It was difficult because my friend had heatstroke. CX: That's terrible. Was your friend safe? CO: Yes, somehow. But it was dangerous. CX: Right now, there's talk that emergency transport isn't possible due to things like COVID. CO: Yes, it seems they hadn't been drinking much water and collapsed. CX: That's dangerous. Staying hydrated is important. CO: ""Yes. I was being scolded by the doctor."" CX: There is news that a typhoon is coming, are you alright over there? CO: Yes, I think the location is fine. How about there? CX: This seems to be okay for now as well. CO: I'm glad to hear that. Are you prepared for disasters? CX: Honestly, no. But we do have some water and canned food to some extent. CO: I am often affected by typhoon damage, so I am prepared. CX: I see. I think it's wonderful that you are well-prepared. CO: No, no, but if we don't prepare, there could be quite a lot of damage. CX: I see. My home is on the second floor of an apartment building, so I don't think anything too serious will happen. CO: That sounds good. Last year, there was damage in the neighborhood due to signs flying around in the typhoon. CX: Wow, that's quite terrible. CO: Yes, I've been careful since then. CX: Typhoons and heavy rains, there's a lot of climate news, so I'm worried. CO: Sure. The translated sentence is: ""Is that so? The typhoon is in the Kanto region now, right?"" CX: It seems so. It looks like sports and events are being canceled. CO: I see, I'm worried about my friend who went to the Kanto region. CX: Hmm. I hope nothing happens. CO: Yes, I think so."
7,"CX: Thank you in advance. Do you have something like an Obon holiday? CO: Please. Yes. I have about a week. CX: That's nice. Do you have any plans for the holiday? CO: There is nothing in particular this year. CX: I see. Is it difficult to make plans because of COVID-19? CO: Yes, exactly. If it wasn't there, I would have gone somewhere else. CX: Really, how long will the coronavirus continue? CO: I see. Since it's going on right now, I'll stay quiet this time. CX: I hope things settle down quickly so we can go out and have fun. CO: Yes, do you have any plans? CX: I don't have an Obon holiday itself. CO: I see. Is it work? CX: No. I'm taking a break from work now. So I've been off all the time. CO: ""Then, it's okay!"" CX: That's right. Also, since this summer is hot, it might be difficult to go outside. CO: Certainly. You don't have to overexert yourself. CX: With the coronavirus situation, I'm wondering if I won't be able to do anything this summer. CO: How long have you been resting? CX: It has already been about two and a half years. CO: ""It's long, isn't it? What was your previous job?"" CX: I was working part-time at a gas station, among other jobs. CO: I see. Juggling multiple jobs seems busy. CX: The work itself is easy, but working day and night was really tough. CO: Certainly. Are you still not looking for a job yet? CX: Yes. I am currently carefully considering what to do next. CO: I see. It seems difficult to move around now with the coronavirus situation. CX: That's really it. There are fewer job openings as well. CO: That's right. Jobs have disappeared and there are a lot of people flooding job listings. CX: I wonder what will happen next. CO: I really think so."
8,"CX: Hello! Nice to meet you! AT: Nice to meet you, please take care of me. CX: Is it hot there today? AT: ""It's humid, I think it's because a typhoon is approaching."" CX: I see, it's quite hot and stuffy here too. AT: It's been hot lately, I guess it's unavoidable since it's summer. CX: I feel like it has been getting hotter and hotter these past few years. AT: Me too, it seems that there were regions that exceeded 40 degrees this year. CX: That's right. Actually, I went to Tokyo during that period, and it was extremely hot. AT: That was unfortunate, but it's always cool indoors. CX: To prevent heatstroke, we basically played inside the indoor building all the time. AT: That's correct, in other regions not only is the heat intense, but also the water damage is severe. CX: Certainly. In the area where I live, it has been raining heavily this past week. AT: Was there any damage to your house? CX: Fortunately, there was no damage to the house. AT: ""My parent's hometown is Gojome Town in Akita Prefecture, and it is being reported a lot in the news today."" CX: I see. Are you safe at the moment? AT: Yes, it seems to be okay. The weather has been unstable, making it a terrible summer, hasn't it? CX: ""That's true. The coronavirus is annoying enough as it is."" AT: ""It's becoming popular again, and I often see news about medical strain."" CX: They said on the news that emergency transport can't keep up due to COVID-19 and heatstroke, and it's scary. AT: That's right, I can't imagine people who are suffering from other illnesses not being able to receive treatment. CX: That's right. It's painful that there are people who cannot receive medical care and pass away due to non-COVID reasons. AT: COVID-19 has generated various types, and I feel like wondering when it will end. CX: ""Last year I thought it was over after getting the vaccine, but it seems like it will continue for a while."" AT: ""Right, the fourth story is coming up normally, isn't it?"" CX: ""This is the fourth time this month, but I'm sure there will be a fifth and sixth time as well."" AT: ""This is already the fourth time, right? Have you been okay with side effects in the past?"" CX: The side effects of the third Moderna shot were tough, so I really don't want to get another one. AT: It comes to that, doesn't it? Let's make sure to take care of our health."
9,"CX: Good evening. Is it almost time for dinner? AT: That's true, it's time to start getting ready. CX: What are you planning to eat? AT: Actually, I haven't decided yet. What will you eat? CX: Tonight, we'll have miso soup and canned fish, right? AT: Is that all? CX: Yes, recently my stomach hasn't been feeling well, so I'm eating less at dinner. AT: I see, fish is nutritious, so canned fish is easy to eat and convenient. CX: For now, I am just trying to get the minimum necessary nutrition. AT: Do you eat vegetables? CX: I will eat it. I'll add vegetables to the miso soup. AT: If so, that's a good balance. Do you eat properly in the morning and afternoon? CX: Yes, I have a solid breakfast and lunch, and keep dinner light. AT: In that case, there's no problem at all. I just have to sleep in the evening. CX: However, I'm still troubled because I've recently started gaining weight. AT: That's surprising, could it be due to lack of exercise? CX: That too, and I wonder if the autonomic nerves are affected. AT: I see, indeed it is important to organize that as well. CX: I often wake up in the middle of the night because it's hard to sleep, which might not be good. AT: Me too, I wake up about once every three hours. CX: I wish it were a little cooler or that there was less of a temperature difference. AT: Don't you have the air conditioner on at home? CX: ""I live in Hokkaido and don't have an air conditioner at home."" AT: In Hokkaido, summers are still fairly hot, and the rain and earthquakes have also been intense. CX: In the past, I was fine without an air conditioner, but recently it's been especially hot. AT: Let's consider installing an air conditioner! CX: I'll seriously think about it next year! AT: It's a good idea to research various measures this year for heatstroke prevention and getting good sleep. CX: Yes, I'd like to have the installation done around early spring. AT: Since reservations get crowded in summer, I agree with that plan!"
10,"CX: Thank you in advance. Do you have any plans for tomorrow? AT: Sure. Here is the translated sentence:

""Please. As of now, I have no plans for tomorrow. How about you?"" CX: I don't have any plans either, so I plan to spend the day leisurely just like today. AT: I have the same plan. Since I work on Monday, I often relax on Sunday. CX: What kind of work do you do? AT: I am a system engineer. My work mainly involves desk work. CX: It seems like a job that is quite hard on your shoulders and eyes. AT: ""My shoulders and lower back get stiff, so I try to move them occasionally."" CX: ""I used to do desk work before, and it really takes a toll on your body, doesn't it?"" AT: It is clear that it becomes hard when touched, and it feels uncomfortable and unpleasant normally. CX: It seems that you shouldn't massage yourself too much, but I end up doing it anyway. AT: I am buying massage machines and going to a chiropractor. CX: You need something like that, right? I often used the one with adzuki beans for warming. AT: I just learned about that for the first time. What kind of thing is it? CX: It's something you heat up in the microwave. Then you warm it up and place it on your eyes or shoulders. AT: It seems effective because it improves blood circulation! CX: That's right, and it's also great that it can be used repeatedly! AT: Certainly, doesn't your body get stiff when you read books and such? CX: You seem to be stiff. In such cases, I do some stretching to loosen up. AT: After all, stretching is necessary, but it's hard to do at the office with people watching. CX: I see. Would it be okay to do stretches like turning your neck or pulling your arms back? AT: That should be fine, I'll make sure to move around frequently when working from home. CX: Have you been able to work from home without going to the office? Like remote work. AT: Right now, it's about half going to the office and half working remotely. CX: Has the only good thing about the COVID-19 pandemic been that we can now work from home? AT: That is true, it's nice to cut down on commute rushes and commute time. CX: Crowded trains are tough too, aren't they? AT: That's right, with the ongoing COVID situation, I'll try to adjust so that we can make better use of working from home. CX: I hope that telecommuting becomes more widespread. AT: Sure, thank you!"
