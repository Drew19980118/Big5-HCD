1,"AX: Good evening. I look forward to working with you. AN: Good evening. Likewise, thank you in advance. AX: The hot days continue, but are you doing well? AN: Yes, fortunately, I've been healthy and doing well. Are you okay? AX: For now, I'm okay. Thank you. The weather can be severe in some regions, can't it? AN: Yes, there were regions that seemed to be having a hard time with the continuous heavy rain. AX: I currently live in Kansai, and the rain was quite heavy on Saturday. AN: Oh, I also live in Kansai. The rain wasn't that bad here. AX: I see. Are you okay with the heat or the cold? AN: I am not good with either, but I might be worse with the heat. AX: If you're okay with the air conditioner and such, it's fine, but are you able to use it well? AN: That's because I have poor circulation, so I really dislike air conditioning. AX: There are quite a few people like that, aren't there? Our workplace is also very cold. AN: Is that so? Are you taking a jacket or something? AX: Yes. Two well-built women lower the temperature, right? AN: Oh no, that's troublesome. AX: Well, I won't say anything, but I'll wear this. It's impossible and unpleasant to do the opposite. AN: You are so kind! Don't you get swollen when your body gets too cold? AX: Your shoulders and head can start to hurt, right? When you go outside, it feels warm. AN: That's right. I feel like my blood circulation has gotten worse. AX: Since I am from Hokkaido, I might not be quite used to the air conditioning. AN: Are you from Hokkaido? They don't really use air conditioners there, right? AX: I see. I don't know about recently, but the heat doesn't last long. AN: Is that so? Is winter extremely cold after all? AX: No, no. Well, places like Asahikawa go down to minus 20 or 30. AN: Incredible. It's a temperature beyond my imagination. AX: It's the one where you can hammer a nail with a banana. AN: It's a scene you often see in manga. AX: Haha. That might be true. The usual way to use a banana is different, after all. AN: I imagined it for a moment and laughed. Well, it's time, so I'll take my leave around here."
2,"AX: Thank you for your hard work. AN: Thank you for your hard work. AX: When it's hot, I tend to want to eat something cold, how about you? AN: Same here. I had ice cream after my bath today too. AX: That's nice. I heard they are having an AI expo in Osaka now. AN: ""Could it be the department store in Tennoji?"" AX: Yes, indeed. As expected from a local. Have you been there already? AN: ""Not yet. Have you already gone?"" AX: No. It's just that my wife is at her part-time job. AN: Is that so? It sounds like a fun part-time job! AX: ""They said it looked interesting and went. It seems Horiemon was there."" AN: ""Horie-mon! Were you here as a customer?"" AX: Apparently, they were introducing the shop for a live stream. AN: I see. Actually, I have never been to the AI Expo. AX: I came to Kansai with the coronavirus three years ago, and this is said to be the first time in three years as well. AN: Is that so! I've always wanted to go there, so maybe I'll give it a try. AX: ""I heard it will be going on until next week. I secretly want to go, too."" AN: If it's until next week, I think I can make time. Are you going to go see how your wife is doing at work? AX: I think it's better not to see it. I'll go when they're not there. AN: I see. The kids will probably be happy if we take them along, so we will go together. AX: Certainly. Our youngest child is in the third year of junior high school, so it's a delicate situation. AN: ""It's a chance to go out under the pretext of being able to eat ice cream!"" AX: That's right. We need to somehow convince them and get there. AN: When they become a third-year middle school student, do they already have a rebellious phase? AX: My rebellious phase was around the upper grades of elementary school. I've calmed down quite a bit. AN: Oh my, our oldest child is 5 years old now, but I wonder if they will go through a rebellious phase someday too? AX: It's currently the most active time, and it feels like I can't take my eyes off. AN: Yes, it's become much calmer. The younger one is 2 years old, so I can't take my eyes off this one. AX: At 2 years old, you don't even know where you're going, right? I think it must be tough. AN: Let's both do our best with raising our children."
3,"AX: Good evening. Nice to meet you. AN: Good evening, nice to meet you. AX: Do you not drink alcohol very much? AN: I tend to drink quite a bit. How about you? AX: ""Sometimes I drink. There was an interesting bar the other day."" AN: Please tell me what kind of bar it is! AX: This was my first time going, but I noticed midway that the clientele was unusual. AN: I wonder what kind of customer base it was? AX: At first, I didn't notice because it was dark, but everyone was in their 70s or older. AN: That's quite a silver space! AX: There were both men and women, and the conversation was amazing. AN: I'm curious about the content of the conversation! AX: ""Somehow, the other day at the entrance, they said they fell and needed seven stitches."" AN: ""Oh no! Isn't that a serious injury?"" AX: The entrance to the store wasn't that high, but I was startled. AN: ""Is this really a time for drinking? I'm not sure if it was grandpa or grandma."" AX: That person was female. She was a grandmother. AN: Grandma, please rest at home! AX: ""It is located in a place called Higashi-Mikuni. The bartender was a woman in her 40s."" AN: ""Is it Higashi-Mikuni? There are quite a few deep (interesting) shops there, aren't there?"" AX: ""On my way back from work. The bartender looked younger due to the combined effect of the surrounding clientele."" AN: That's right, if everyone around is in their 70s, someone in their 40s would be quite young and lively. AX: Well, I couldn't really feel it to that extent, though. Until the point of being lively. AN: Was it too much to be vibrant? AX: But for a moment, I thought so. I was very careful with my footing on the way back. AN: If you get injured, it will be a serious problem. AX: ""Because we are the same kind. Joining the ranks of old men."" AN: My husband once got so drunk that he broke his front tooth. AX: That's quite dangerous. You didn't touch it, did you? Take care. AN: Yes, let's be careful."
4,"AX: Thank you for your hard work. I look forward to working with you. AN: Thank you for your hard work today as well. Please take care of it! AX: What kind of alcohol do you like? AN: I often drink beer and wine! AX: Oh, that's nice. I like standing wine bars. AN: I haven't been drinking outside at all lately, so I'm really jealous. AX: Since coming to Osaka, I haven't been able to go either. Maybe only twice to a strange bar. AN: ""Isn't the rate of encountering strange bars quite high?"" AX: No, I went there again to check the situation for the first time. AN: ""What, an unexpected second visit!"" AX: No. I thought it was a coincidence and went. Because it bothered me. AN: ""Was there an interesting incident the second time as well?"" AX: ""The second time, the type of customers didn't change either. That's the kind of place it is, huh?"" AN: It must be a bar where regulars from the silver generation gather. AX: It was a bit of a complex feeling since it was my first time at a bar in Osaka after a while. AN: There are many better bars, so please don't be discouraged! AX: ""Is that so? It still doesn't feel real."" AN: Osaka has many good places, but Kyoto also has wonderful bars. AX: Kyoto has a wonderful feeling, doesn't it? It's all about the atmosphere of the city. AN: ""There are a lot of bars with a great atmosphere, aren't there? A bar in Kyoto with a wide selection of whiskey was the best."" AX: Oh, it sounds authentic. I'd like to visit there. AN: Please visit if you get the chance. AX: Sure. ""I see. I'll try exploring various things. I haven't been able to go to Kyoto much."" AN: Because of COVID-19, it was quite difficult to go out, wasn't it? AX: That's right. In the first year, most of the shops were closed, and I didn't feel like going. AN: Certainly, almost all the stores had their shutters down. AX: Yeah. Recently, I finally felt like going, but since it's increasing again, it's a bit tricky, right? AN: ""It felt like just when the shortened business hours had finally ended, didn't it?"" AX: That's right. That's why drinking at home is more common, isn't it? AN: Same here. I hope daily life returns soon."
5,"AX: Good evening. Thank you in advance. BG: Good evening! The equipment from Kamakura Seisakusho is too expensive!! AX: If you carry that, it looks heavy. BG: ""It feels like you're carrying the device on your back, right? That seems exhausting in a different way because it's too heavy."" AX: It's true. Speaking of which, I just remembered something. Can I talk about something completely different? BG: Yes! Please!! AX: Have you ever had an interview or meeting with any staff at work? BG: Hmm, not recently. I do have memories from the past, though. AX: In the past, there was only one person I interviewed who I couldn't help but laugh at. BG: ""Huh? What is it? It's like a comedy sketch, haha. Please tell me."" AX: You know, she's a 27-year-old woman. So I asked her what the most enjoyable job she's had so far is. BG: Ah, the interviewer is your older brother, right? Instead of being the one interviewed. AX: Yes, yes. I attended the interview just in case. Do you know what was fun? BG: Hmm. What could it be?? Was it suspicious behavior? AX: When I asked the woman about the most enjoyable job she ever had, her answer was being a shrine maiden. BG: ""Huh? A shrine maiden?? Wow, that's unexpected!!"" AX: ""That's right. And when I gave that answer, something strange happened."" BG: Ah! I got it!! Did they say they were working like this and then re-enacted it? AX: That's also interesting, but when I saw their face, it was bad. BG: ""Huh? Not a re-enactment, but their face?? How bad was it?"" AX: Snot was dripping from my nose and had reached my mouth. BG: Huh? I wonder why? Is it hay fever?? AX: I don't know. I couldn't ask. I couldn't look at their face from there. BG: ""That's right. I can't ask, I can't ask. I wonder if they don't notice?"" AX: ""Right? Then, when I asked what kind of job they'd like to try next, it was a shrine maiden after all."" BG: ""Eh?? What is the reason you applied for an interview at my brother's company?"" AX: Apparently, shrine maidens retire at 26. I didn't know that. BG: ""Ah, so you can't be a shrine maiden anymore. You're an interesting person... Passed?"" AX: I declined, but another person was hired. Afterwards, since there was still a runny nose, I asked through the sales department to address it. BG: Wow. You were luckily hired. You are a lucky woman."
6,"AX: Good evening. Thank you in advance. BG: Good evening. This is sudden, but is there anything you are afraid of? AX: ""Is it scary? Recently, I haven't done it much, but I'm always thinking about being careful with my words."" BG: ""Oh, there's that kind of scariness too, right? Since it's summer, it's more about ghosts and that kind of story."" AX: Oops. That way? Is your sister scary? BG: No, no, but your language is perfectly fine. I'm the one who needs to be careful. AX: ""When I lived in Hakodate, there were people who were influenced by having parents from Aomori which was nearby."" BG: ""Is it something like that? A religion?"" AX: No, no, I was doing a job called Itako. Are you worried about something like that, sister? BG: Itako... I've heard of it. It's scary. I'm a scaredy-cat. AX: I see. I think it's better not to be too scared. Also, it's not good to look out of mere curiosity. BG: ""I'm not really curious about it. What's scary is the darkness that comes after such stories."" AX: ""I see. It is definitely unpleasant. Also, people in such professions can really be scary."" BG: I have never interacted with such a person, but you have, haven't you? Were you okay? AX: Ah. It seems there were people who often saw things and people who were scared, and that son in question was also going to the hospital. BG: It doesn't seem to be the usual kind of fear. It feels like an unknown type of fear to me as well. AX: I think you can prevent it to some extent if you pay attention to what you usually see and hear. BG: ""Huh? What do you mean?"" AX: Ah, for example, when watching the news about Ukraine every day, you might feel down or something like that, right? BG: Yes, we do. AX: Don't you feel down when you see nothing but news about rising prices and uncertain prospects? BG: Sure. Here is the translated sentence: ""I stopped watching the news because it only made me anxious and I didn't want to feel even more depressed."" AX: I believe it is important to be cautious about what we incorporate into our daily lives, including spiritual things. BG: I see, that's what it is. Sorry for being slow. Thank you very much! AX: No, no. Recently, information just keeps coming in like push notifications, doesn't it? BG: That's right. There's just so much I don't want to see that I've come to dislike TV. AX: Me too. In the past, I used to be able to choose books and other things myself. I'm worried about the kids too. BG: That's right. I feel uneasy about a world where everything can be done online. We have to strike a good balance. AX: That's right. If you look at the screen and get tired eyes like me, that's no good. BG: Me too. Although there was nothing I couldn't see, Hazuki Loupe is my friend."
7,"AX: Good evening. I look forward to working with you. BG: Good evening. Thank you, likewise! AX: Speaking of which, did we talk about AI? BG: No, we haven't talked about that. AX: I see. Do you have any opportunities to use or touch it closely? BG: Hmm, no. It's far from cutting edge. AX: It seems that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the chatbots at inquiry desks have rapidly started utilizing AI. BG: Oh!! We found a connection! Sorry about that. I've been using the inquiry desk quite a bit. AX: Yeah. Recently, when you access the website, ""Do you need any help?"" appears at the bottom right, right? BG: It's a bit of a hassle, but it's something you should open at least once. AX: ""It's annoying, right? It was originally terrible in Japanese, but it improved all at once."" BG: I see. When I'm really in a tight spot, it's completely useless. AX: I think they are probably using a cheap type. BG: I see. It might often be fine if it's from a reputable company. AX: Most good ones generally use IBM's Watson as their base. BG: ""You are very knowledgeable. It's like 'No doubt if it's Watson!'"" AX: Yes. The famous one in Japan is Pepper-kun. BG: ""I may or may not see you at the restaurant."" AX: That’s it. The appearance is a facade, and inside, it's just Watson. BG: I see. It must be tough everywhere. It must be expensive. AX: That would cost tens of millions if we tried to implement it properly. BG: Does it take that much time? It's difficult to incorporate easily. AX: Trying out with 300 or so. It seems they are improving accuracy with both machine learning and deep learning. BG: I see. So there's a kind of level system, huh? Well, that makes sense. AX: Listening, hearing, and trying to hear are analogous systems to machine learning. BG: I see. AX: Deep learning differentiates between ""kiku"" meaning chrysanthemum, ""kiku"" meaning to listen, and ""kiku"" meaning to ask, as they are used in different contexts. BG: ""Ah, that's right. It's quite specialized."" AX: It seems that it can only understand 0 and 1, so it makes judgments by doing that in tens of thousands of ways. BG: That's interesting. It looks like a fascinating world when I did a little research!"
8,"AX: Good evening. I look forward to working with you today. AG: Good evening! Likewise, I look forward to working with you. AX: Speaking of summer, many people prefer to have cold things; how about you? AG: I've heard that cold things can harm your body, so I try to avoid them as much as possible. AX: Are there many warm things? AG: ""It's just as much as I can do, like drinking soup or room-temperature tea."" AX: I see. So does that mean it doesn't really matter whether it's summer or winter? AG: Yes, indeed. How about over there? AX: ""In the summer, I can have cold things and in the winter, I have warm things."" AG: ""I see. Do you also eat ice cream?"" AX: I will eat ice cream too. Can't you eat ice cream? AG: No, even though I said I should cut back on cold things, I still end up wanting to eat ice cream. It's delicious, isn't it? AX: That's right. Speaking of which, the AI Expo is currently being held in the area where I live. AG: ""Does 'Ice Expo' mean it's an event where various kinds of ice cream are gathered!?"" AX: That's right. It seems that they have gathered from all over Japan, and it's the first time in three years. AG: Amazing! From all over Japan!? Are you going there? AX: Actually, I went there today. AG: Oh! How timely! How was it? AX: There were things like freshly baked waffle cones with buns and soft serve on top. AG: Amazing! Luxurious!! But you can't really walk around eating ice cream that much, right? AX: I see. I could only eat one. But there were various other things too. AG: That's right. When I think about all the delicious-looking ones coming one after another, I can't seem to narrow it down to just one! AX: That's right. In Yamanashi, they had various fruit sherbet ice creams. AG: Yamanashi has delicious fruits, doesn't it? Grapes, pears, peaches. Just imagining them makes my mouth water! AX: There was also one that was entirely covered with mandarin oranges and had whipped ice cream inside. AG: Wow! What an unusual and rare ice cream! It looks interesting too! AX: ""That's really true. There was also something called macaron ice, and women were lining up in long queues for it."" AG: Indeed. It's an ice cream that women are likely to like. I wonder if they will eventually sell it at convenience stores? AX: It's easy to go and buy things at a convenience store because it's convenient, isn't it? AG: Yes, I definitely hope so!"
9,"AX: Good evening. Thank you in advance. AG: Good evening! Thank you, I look forward to working with you as well. AX: Speaking of which, did you prefer hot drinks? AG: I prefer warm. How about you? AX: I am fine with either. Do you drink coffee? AG: I drink it. I have 1 or 2 cups a day. AX: I see. I had an opportunity to listen to the CEO of Starbucks Japan a while ago. AG: Wow! There was such an opportunity! AX: I called him at the office. By the way, he said the coffee at 7-Eleven is delicious. AG: Thinking that it's coffee approved by the president of Starbucks, Seven-Eleven is amazing. AX: He also mentioned that cultivating empathy among staff members is left to each individual. AG: Is that so? Did you feel that it was helpful in various ways? AX: For example, if there is someone who has been in an accident nearby, the clerk will look out the window and hand over coffee based on their judgment. AG: ""The feeling is that we will give you a free drink!"" AX: Yes, it seems that the clerk did it voluntarily. AG: I see. If you were in that situation, would you be the one to give it? AX: I think they went to talk to them, but I don't know if they were able to make coffee. They must have been very empathetic. AG: If it were me, I feel like I would have handed it over, no matter what the company said afterward. AX: That's suitable for Starbucks. I think it's good. AG: Is that so? It feels like I react without even thinking. AX: A while ago, when I went to Starbucks, I was impressed by something. AG: Oh! What kind of thing was it? AX: A young girl could only communicate in writing, probably because she was deaf, but she was a store clerk. AG: I see. There are people like that, too. AX: At that time, I couldn't hear, so it was an original menu with a cute illustration asking to point here. AG: Wow! That's nice. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy! AX: The surrounding store clerks only helped when I was in trouble and left me alone otherwise. AG: That's right. That level of distance would make it easier for them to work, too. AX: I see. As a customer, I felt grateful. AG: ""It feels like both the customers and the staff are looking out for each other, creating a good atmosphere!"""
10,"AX: Good evening. I look forward to working with you. AG: Good evening! Likewise, please take care of me. AX: Speaking of summer, shaved ice is also sold at storefronts, do you ever go? AG: Ah! The other day, I found something that looked delicious, so I bought it for the first time in a while. AX: Oh. Have you already eaten? AG: Yes! There is a well known for its delicious water, and it seems that they made it by freezing the water from that well. AX: Isn't that authentic? What kind of shaved ice is it? AG: The ice had a clear taste, and the syrup was genuinely homemade. It's shaved ice from a cake shop. AX: ""Is it a cake shop? That's interesting. Speaking of which, there's also a shaved ice shop in the neighborhood."" AG: Oh! Have you been there? AX: I haven't been there yet, but it's the shaved ice from the dumpling shop. AG: Dango shop! I wonder if there's something special about it. AX: These days, it's common to see shaved ice with various toppings, isn't it? AG: Certainly! They are definitely piling up various things, perhaps with an awareness of how it looks. AX: So, you know. You might be able to guess, but it seems that it's topped with three-colored dumplings. AG: Three-color dango! As expected of a dango shop!! AX: That's right. It's a bit much, but for some reason, I'm curious. AG: ""It seems like a chilled zenzai, and it looks delicious, doesn't it? Is that a shiratama?"" AX: I like white dumplings, but since there were three colors, I'm undecided. AG: ""The texture might be closer to a dumpling than a rice cake! I wonder if it also has sweet red bean paste on it?"" AX: ""There didn't appear to be any. Recently, there are various kinds like fluffy and creamy ones, right?"" AG: ""Yes, there is. It's a trend from Taiwanese shaved ice, isn't it?"" AX: That's how it is. Have you tried Taiwanese shaved ice? AG: ""I saw it on TV, but I haven't actually had it. The mango flavor looks delicious, doesn't it?"" AX: The visuals are really impactful, aren't they? AG: The idea of flavoring the ice itself in shaved ice surprised me. AX: ""That means they are flavoring the ice. I never considered that at all."" AG: That's why it doesn't sink too much in the syrup and stays fluffy, right? I want to try it once! AX: I see. I understand how it works now. Thank you very much. AG: No, no! Hopefully, we can both eat it someday!"
