1,"HQ: Hello GR: Hello HQ: The weather continues to be bad, doesn't it? GR: Let's see, today it’s barely not raining. HQ: Is it sunny? GR: ""It's not clear, it's cloudy."" HQ: ""I hope it will be sunny."" GR: Yes, it's always raining and it makes me feel down. HQ: The temperature difference is also extreme. GR: It seems that drastic temperature changes can negatively affect mental health. HQ: I wonder if that's why I feel uneasy. GR: Maybe so. HQ: It's getting colder, but it feels more like winter than autumn, doesn't it? GR: It feels like we've stepped into winter but have managed to recover. HQ: It was cold, so I turned on the heater. GR: Is that so? That's a bit early. HQ: We were using the air conditioner until recently, but now we're using the heater. GR: I bought a blanket. HQ: ""A blanket sounds good. I need to buy one too."" GR: I am worried if I can get by with just a blanket since I don't have a comforter. HQ: Aren't you going to buy it? GR: I haven't bought it because I thought I might have trouble finding a place to store it in summer. HQ: Indeed, even when compressed, it still takes up space. GR: It seems like we'll have to rely on the heater. HQ: I think I need to clean the air conditioner. GR: I have to call the contractor too. HQ: It's kind of moldy. GR: It gets moldy quickly, doesn't it? HQ: It's scary if I mess up cleaning it myself and end up breaking it. GR: That's right."
2,"HQ: Hello GR: Hello HQ: What were you doing during the three-day weekend? GR: Apart from going out for a drink, I didn't do anything else. HQ: It was raining, wasn't it? GR: I see. What were you doing, <HQ>? HQ: I was also at home the whole time. It seems my friend went to Atami. GR: That sounds great. Is it a hot spring trip? HQ: ""It seems like it's a hot spring trip. Apparently, it was quite crowded."" GR: ""It's a three-day weekend."" HQ: I guess it's better to go on ordinary weekdays. GR: It would be nice if I had weekdays off from work. HQ: That's right. If you have weekends off, you'll have to take paid leave. GR: ""That's right. But I want to go to a hot spring."" HQ: There are spas in the city, but isn't that kind of thing no good? GR: It's a bit expensive, isn't it? HQ: ""Well, yeah, it might be expensive."" GR: ""In the end, it's crowded in the city and you can't relax."" HQ: ""That's certainly true in Tokyo. Maybe the super sentos in slightly out-of-the-way places are less crowded."" GR: It seems that there are many elderly people. HQ: That might be the case. GR: There's a super sento in the neighborhood, but the price is ridiculously high. HQ: How much is it? GR: It's about 3000 yen. HQ: Ah, it might be a little expensive. GR: ""There are also non-chain public baths, and those cost around 500 yen."" HQ: ""It's cheap, isn't it! Have you been there?"" GR: ""I haven't been yet, but I'm thinking of going."" HQ: If the 500 yen one is nicer, then that one is fine, right? GR: I see."
3,"HQ: Hello GR: Hello HQ: What would you use 100,000 yen for? GR: I will use the full amount to pay off my debt. HQ: Do you have debt? GR: ""There is a scholarship."" HQ: A scholarship, it's tough, isn't it? GR: I want to return it quickly. HQ: There are also movements like scholarship exemptions, right? GR: If that happens, the person who returns it will lose out, right? HQ: ""It's okay to default, right?"" GR: If it's okay, I think I won't give it back. HQ: That's right. GR: ""I also used the benefits for repaying my student loans."" HQ: ""Is that so? I invested it."" GR: Has it increased? HQ: It increased just a little bit. GR: That's nice. I'm envious. HQ: Have you ever invested? GR: No, there isn't. HQ: Are you interested? GR: It feels a bit scary. HQ: ""It can sometimes be a negative."" GR: I'm thinking about studying once I've finished paying back my student loan. HQ: You're going to take on the challenge, right? GR: I thought that if I don't do that, the money won't increase. HQ: That's right. GR: They say let money work for you, don't they? HQ: Yes, yes. It's important. GR: That's right."
4,"HQ: Good evening. GR: Good evening. HQ: Do you have an ideal way to spend a holiday? GR: ""Two days of a three-day weekend for travel, and one day for rest is ideal."" HQ: It's tiring if you travel for all three days, isn't it? GR: I see. I want to spend the 1st day doing household chores and relaxing at home. HQ: That's right. I understand. GR: Do you have an ideal way to spend your holidays, Bask? HQ: I just want to spend time slowly. GR: Aren't you going out? HQ: ""I don't go out much. There's nowhere I want to go."" GR: What do you do at home? HQ: Watching anime and cooking, I guess. GR: ""Cooking? It seems like you can make elaborate dishes."" HQ: But I don't really feel like making it just for myself. GR: I understand. You put more effort into making something for someone else, don't you? HQ: ""Because I can't afford to fail."" GR: That's right. HQ: I also recently enjoy taking walks. GR: It has gotten cooler, making it easier to go for a walk, hasn't it? HQ: Yes. It becomes difficult to take walks in the winter, so I am getting active while I still can. GR: In winter, you don't want to go out, right? HQ: ""Well, let's see."" GR: In winter, I spend my time at home watching anime and dramas. HQ: ""Especially around the New Year holidays, it's like that. I'm staying in the kotatsu."" GR: The only thing to do is to go to the first shrine visit or the first sale, isn't it? HQ: ""I finish the New Year's sale shopping online."" GR: Are you online shopping? HQ: Lucky bags, for example, are sometimes more reliably available online. GR: I see."
5,"HQ: Good evening. GR: Good evening. HQ: Are there any moments when you feel like you've become an adult? GR: Is it when I start to feel age in my face? HQ: I am also worried because my face is sagging. GR: Sagging is difficult to deal with, isn't it? HQ: There's nothing we can do. GR: I am troubled by severe rough skin and dark circles. HQ: ""Do you go to a dermatology clinic for cosmetic treatments?"" GR: I want to go, but it's too expensive for me to afford. HQ: Sure, it is certainly expensive. GR: It's not easy to go there casually. HQ: I have also considered getting a thread lift. GR: Have you done it before? HQ: No, it costs around 100,000 yen but apparently only lasts for about six months. GR: ""The cost performance is too bad."" HQ: ""That's right. It's ridiculous, isn't it?"" GR: Is there nothing else effective for sagging? HQ: 'I've heard HIFU is also good, but it ultimately costs around 100,000 yen.' GR: How long does it last? HQ: This will also take about half a year. GR: ""That's also not cost-effective."" HQ: Beauty clinics make a huge profit, don't they? GR: I feel like it would be better if it were cheaper. HQ: In South Korea, it seems to be less than half the price. GR: ""Because it's a beauty powerhouse."" HQ: I'm jealous. GR: I wish Japan would be like that too. HQ: That's right. GR: We can only hope that it becomes cheaper."
6,"HQ: Good evening. GR: Good evening. HQ: Which would you prefer: a low-paying but enjoyable job or a high-paying but boring job? GR: Is the salary high? HQ: Why is that? GR: I think if you don't have money, you have to put up with various things. HQ: I see. But isn't it painful to continue doing a boring job five days a week? GR: I think it would be good if I could get money. HQ: Money is the most important thing, isn't it? GR: Of course. I believe that a job that is only enjoyable is an exploitation of motivation. HQ: It's becoming a problem now. GR: I think it's good to make fun things a hobby. HQ: That's true. GR: Which side are you on, <HQ>? HQ: If I can make a living, I think I'd prefer a fun job. GR: ""Even if the salary is low?"" HQ: Yes, I feel like I would get depressed if there's no fun. GR: That may indeed be true. HQ: If I could make a ton of money, I might consider it. GR: I feel like I might regret whichever one I choose. HQ: You regret the things you couldn't enjoy, right? GR: The story might change if it comes to a point where I am just grateful to have a job. HQ: That's right. GR: ""Sickness or a major recession, you know."" HQ: It's scary to think about another financial crisis like the Lehman Shock happening again. GR: Restructuring is frightening. HQ: We need to acquire technical skills and abilities. GR: I also think connections are important. HQ: Connections are important, aren't they? GR: That's right."
7,"HQ: Good evening. GR: Good evening. HQ: Today was tough due to a hangover. GR: Did you drink yesterday? HQ: I drank a lot for the first time in a while. GR: A hangover is tough, isn't it? HQ: ""The whole morning is wasted. Even though it's the last day of the three-day weekend."" GR: What a waste. HQ: I truly wasted something valuable. GR: The amino acid supplement from Ajinomoto is recommended for preventing hangovers. HQ: There is something like that, isn't there? GR: Yes. I recommend it. HQ: I'll look into it a bit. GR: By all means! HQ: I used to not get hangovers, but now I feel my age. GR: ""Has my liver function weakened?"" HQ: The numbers are getting worse. GR: I see, in that case, it might be better not to drink it. HQ: I thought it was a bad idea and held back, but I ended up drinking yesterday. GR: Is there a reason for it? HQ: No, I just happened to find a drink I like at the store. GR: I will end up drinking that. HQ: I ended up drinking a lot. GR: By the way, what kind of alcohol is it? HQ: It is sake. GR: ""Sake Pakapaka tastes bad, doesn't it?"" HQ: Yes, it is really a bad way to drink. GR: Are you okay now? HQ: Yes, thanks to you. GR: In that case, I'm glad to hear that."
8,"HQ: Good evening. GR: Good evening. HQ: Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend? GR: I haven't been here for about a year. HQ: ""I'm not there either. Which do you prioritize, appearance or personality?"" GR: ""At first, it's the appearance."" HQ: If the appearance is impossible, then it’s impossible, right? GR: Yes, there are unacceptable lines. HQ: ""Clothing and hairstyles can be dealt with, but everything else is difficult, isn't it?"" GR: You can't change your body shape right away. HQ: I have dated a slightly overweight girl before. GR: Did you lose weight? HQ: No, we were dating for about a year, but it didn't work out. GR: Once you gain weight, it’s difficult to lose it, isn't it? HQ: I used to work for a food-related company, so there were times when I had to eat for work. GR: That makes it even more difficult. HQ: Well, I think we could have adjusted by reducing the number of meals or something like that. GR: Did it feel like you broke up because you couldn't lose weight? HQ: It's not just that, but that's part of it too. GR: ""Not very attractive as the opposite sex, right?"" HQ: It's not even at the chubby level, and if you're gaining weight now, I thought you would probably gain more weight in the future. GR: As you age, it becomes harder to lose weight. HQ: It has lost its charm. GR: I also want your hairstyle and body shape to be well-groomed. And your beard too. HQ: There is a person with a thick beard. GR: I think you should just get hair removal. HQ: Certainly, if shaving makes it look blue, it seems better to go for hair removal. GR: That's right. HQ: It seems like beard hair removal is extremely painful. GR: I want you to endure and do your best."
9,"HQ: Hello. GR: Hello HQ: Are you going on a trip? GR: ""I don't go very often, but it seems to be cheaper."" HQ: It seems like the government is going to launch some kind of campaign. GR: Is it different from the GOTO Travel program? HQ: I haven't been able to investigate it thoroughly yet, but it might be different. GR: ""Did you go anywhere during the GOTO Travel campaign?"" HQ: I haven't traveled, but I did stay at a hotel. GR: Has it become cheaper? HQ: I was able to stay for about 2000 yen per night. GR: It's cheap! HQ: However, I could only use it once, so I wish I had utilized it more. GR: ""Then, I want to make use of it this time."" HQ: I see. I might want to go to a hot spring. GR: Hot springs are nice. It's also getting colder around this time of year. HQ: It has become the perfect season, hasn't it? GR: Autumn weather tends to be unstable, so it seems like you might end up taking an open-air bath in the rain. HQ: ""Well, that might be a good experience in its own way?"" GR: ""Is it possible that outdoor hot spring baths will be banned in the first place?"" HQ: On drizzly days we could normally get in, but I wonder how it would be in heavy rain. GR: The hot water seems to be getting cold, doesn't it? HQ: Right. GR: If you were to go to a hot spring, where would you like to go? HQ: Since sightseeing seems tiring, I prefer a place where I can focus solely on the hot springs. GR: ""Then it seems like a place where you can enjoy various hot springs would be better than a sightseeing spot."" HQ: I see. There will probably be fewer people if we don't go the mainstream route. GR: ""If it's not the royal road, then where would it be?"" HQ: Well, I'm sure every prefecture has one. GR: Certainly, that’s true."
10,"HQ: Hello GR: Hello HQ: Do you usually drive a car? GR: I don't have a license. HQ: Is that so? Don't you want to take it? GR: Living in Tokyo, I don't really feel the need. HQ: Ah, well, that's right. GR: ""Does Mr./Ms. <HQ> drive?"" HQ: I have a license, but I don't drive much. GR: Do you want a car? HQ: I think it would be convenient to have, but the maintenance costs are no joke. GR: I think it would be useful for families, though. HQ: ""That's right. If cars were my hobby, I would buy it, but they are not."" GR: I'll buy a car when self-driving becomes the default. HQ: Do you feel like you don't want to drive yourself? GR: Yes, it's scary if you run someone over. HQ: An accident seems likely to happen at least once, doesn't it? GR: It would be fine if I just hit something somewhere, but I don't want to drive because it would be no joke if a fatal accident happened. HQ: ""You will get caught, right?"" GR: That's right. HQ: ""Even if it’s the fault of a pedestrian or a bicycle, the car is blamed."" GR: That's the part I dislike. HQ: ""It's quite unreasonable, isn't it?"" GR: ""I think it's unreasonable."" HQ: Even if someone suddenly jumped in, we would still be blamed. GR: It seems like you might get severely blamed by your relatives. HQ: ""Right. And since I witnessed it, I'm definitely likely to get PTSD."" GR: It's impressive that everyone can drive. HQ: ""They say you get used to it."" GR: It doesn't seem like they'll get used to it."
