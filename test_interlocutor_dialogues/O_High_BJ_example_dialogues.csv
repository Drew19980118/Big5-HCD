1,"BJ: Good morning! AN: Good morning! BJ: What are you going to do today? AN: Today, I'm going blueberry picking in the afternoon! BJ: Wow! How fun! AN: That's right. I found a blueberry farm by chance while taking a walk near my house. BJ: It's wonderful to have something like that in the neighborhood. Are blueberries in season during the summer? AN: It seems to be in season until the end of August. BJ: I see. It's nice, picking fruit is fun, isn't it? AN: It's fun, isn't it! I went strawberry picking in the spring! BJ: ""That's quite frequent! You must really like fruit."" AN: I love fruits. My kids also love fruits. BJ: Sounds good. The last time I went grape picking was some years ago. AN: Is that so? Are you picking Delaware grapes? Or Kyoho grapes? BJ: It was Shine Muscat. To Yamanashi! AN: ""Shine Muscat? It looks really delicious!"" BJ: The food was delicious, but I ended up eating a lifetime's worth. I haven't had Shine Muscat since that day. AN: ""It seems like there aren't many opportunities to eat Shine Muscat grapes until you're full. What a valuable experience!"" BJ: ""Certainly. What is your favorite fruit?"" AN: What could it be? A cherry or a strawberry? BJ: Cherries are nice, aren't they? I haven't eaten them in a long time. AN: Likewise, I couldn't eat cherries this year. BJ: When you try to buy them, fruits are expensive, aren't they! AN: ""It's expensive. Cherries and such are luxuries."" BJ: I also only eat bananas in my daily life lol. AN: Speaking of bananas, haven't they been getting more expensive lately? BJ: ""Eh, really? It doesn't feel real."" AN: Around here, you used to be able to buy bananas for about 100 yen, but lately, they cost around 200 yen. BJ: Eh, that's expensive. AN: That's right. I hope prices stabilize too. Well, I guess it's about time to wrap it up around here!"
2,"BJ: Hello! AN: Hello! BJ: Is it summer vacation now? AN: Yes. The children are now on summer vacation. BJ: Sounds good. Are you going somewhere far? AN: During the summer, we usually just play nearby. We plan to go camping in September. BJ: Camping! Sounds great. AN: I'm looking forward to it. Are you going anywhere? BJ: Oh, there are so many places I want to go, but... AN: In this day and age, it's hard to go out, isn't it? BJ: It's true, isn't it? I want to go abroad. AN: ""I understand. It's been three years since I last went."" BJ: Where did you go last? AN: The last one was Taiwan. BJ: ""Taiwan is nice, isn't it? I went there a few years ago too."" AN: The food is delicious, it's close and cheap, so I want to go there again sometime. BJ: Is it Taipei? AN: I went around Taipei and Taichung. Next, I want to go to Tainan. BJ: That's nice. Taiwan really has a sense of familiarity, doesn't it? AN: I see. So, I hope that an emergency situation in Taiwan does not occur. BJ: ""That's true... Peace is the best."" AN: Really? Where do you want to go next overseas? BJ: If it's nearby, maybe Korea or Vietnam. AN: Vietnam sounds great. South Korea has already reopened for tourism, right? BJ: Ah, I wonder how it is. AN: I believe that was the case. My husband mentioned that there were a lot of tourists when he went on a business trip. BJ: Oh! I hope I can go soon. I want the various restrictions to be lifted quickly. AN: That's right. If the waiting period is eliminated, it will be easier to go. BJ: I am looking forward to that day. See you around! AN: Yes. Thank you very much!"
3,"BJ: Hello! BS: Hello! BJ: How often do you usually watch TV? BS: Somehow, I watch it every day. During breakfast and dinner. BJ: ""Oh! Do you have any favorite TV shows?"" BS: I like Kaji Yaro and Banana Man's Sekkaku Gourmet! BJ: It feels like dinner time! You like comedians, don't you? BS: I see. If anything, I like food, so I guess you could say I like it. Do you watch TV? BJ: I see. Hmm, maybe about once or twice a week. BS: Do you watch specific shows regularly? BJ: ""Well, maybe something like Wednesday Downtown."" BS: Wasn't it a program that starts around 10 PM? BJ: That's right! Haven't you seen it? BS: I feel like I've seen it before... I think it was a program verifying ○ theories... BJ: Yes, that's right. Pranks are mainstream, aren't they? BS: I see! Do you like pranks? Or is it the comedians? BJ: ""I like pranks and comedians too! Do you have a favorite comedian?"" BS: I see! Is it Sandwichman? And then there's Jiro from Sissonne, just watching him makes me laugh. BJ: Both are very wonderful people! I like them too. BS: ""It's nice, isn't it? Sandwich Man is wonderful because their MC work is stable."" BJ: The year Sandwich Man won the M1, no matter how many times I watch it, I end up crying. BS: I see! I'll check it out! Do you have a favorite comedian? BJ: Hmm. The person I think is amazing is Mr. Tanaka from Ungirls, I guess. BS: What do you think is amazing about it? BJ: Not only are you good at playing quirky characters, but you’re also strong in comedy improv, so I think you must be really smart! BS: You are also strong in Oogiri! You definitely have an intelligent image. BJ: I feel like you're an entertainer. BS: Certainly. I do miss the Janga Janga era. BJ: Wow, that's nostalgic. Well then, let's end here for today. Thank you very much. BS: Thank you very much!"
4,"BJ: Hello! BS: Hello! BJ: I'm thinking of starting something new, but what do you do on your days off? BS: That's nice! You've been going to the library a lot recently. BJ: ""Library! It's really wonderful!"" BS: There is a fairly large library relatively close to my house! BJ: Do you like books? BS: That's right. I love books! Digital ones are good too, but I like the feel of paper. BJ: ""That's nice. I haven't read any books lately."" BS: I see. Are there any libraries or bookstores nearby? BJ: Neither of them are at the nearest station. What kind of books do you like? BS: That's a shame. I used to read novels, but lately, it's more practical books or self-improvement genres. BJ: So I might not have properly read for years now without realizing it. If you have any recommendations, I'd love to hear them! BS: I see. The book that lowered the hurdle of feeling that cooking is a hassle during this time was a book called ""Tsumamimeshi""! BJ: ""I've never heard of tsumami meshi!"" BS: Do you know Ryuuji, the cooking expert? BJ: I know! I often watch recipe videos. BS: The video is interesting, isn't it! This is that person's recipe book! BJ: ""That person who cooks while being completely drunk, right?"" BS: ""That's right, that's right. On YouTube, he's all over the place, but on terrestrial TV, he's proper. It's that guy."" BJ: Ah, you are publishing a book. That sounds like it will be helpful. BS: ""Yes. It's quick to make, so it's helpful during dinner time."" BJ: ""Is that book also available at the library!?"" BS: Yes, they have them! There are also quite a few recipe books, which is very helpful. BJ: Wow, it's quite a large place, isn't it? I feel like going to the library again after a long time. BS: That's right! I think the library is a good idea! They have magazines and such too! BJ: ""More than anything, it's free, isn't it? It would be nice if there was a movie version of the library too."" BS: Oh, the library I go to also allows you to watch DVDs! BJ: Such an amazing place! I'll go check it out next time. Thank you for the wonderful suggestion. BS: Yes, please enjoy yourself."
5,"BJ: Hello! BQ: Hello. BJ: What do you do on your days off? BQ: ""I'm mostly at home. I often watch subscription services."" BJ: Oh, is it something like Netflix? BQ: Sure, here is the translated sentence: ""Yes, yes. Recently, I've been trying U-NEXT."" BJ: I am also subscribed to U-NEXT. Do you like movies? BQ: I'm not very knowledgeable about it, but I like it. BJ: Have you watched anything recently on subscription services? BQ: I watched ""20th Century Boys"" as a movie. BJ: ""Oh, a live-action one?"" BQ: Yes, that's Kenji-kun. BJ: I saw it when it was first released. Was it interesting? BQ: I also watched it at the cinema and thought I wanted to see it again, so it was interesting. BJ: It's nostalgic. If it's between Japanese and Western movies, is it Japanese movies? BQ: ""I would say I watch Japanese films more, if anything."" BJ: ""Oh, then unext is good. It has a lot of Japanese movies."" BQ: ""The number of works is greater because it is more expensive than other subscriptions, right?"" BJ: Yes, it will be cheaper if you share with your friends. BQ: So there's something called 'share', huh? I didn't know that. BJ: I think it can accommodate up to four people. The monthly fee can also be divided into four parts. BQ: That's a good deal, right? Can you also read magazines? BJ: Yes, for things like manga as well. Although, you mostly need points for them. BQ: ""I see. Are you subscribed to any other services?"" BJ: I am also subscribed to Netflix and Amazon. BQ: ""Quite a few people have joined. I am subscribed to Disney Plus."" BJ: ""Disney Plus seems to have a lot of interesting content recently."" BQ: The short film of Baymax was interesting. BJ: ""I didn't know such a thing existed. I would like to see it."" BQ: I recommend it."
6,"BJ: Hello! BQ: Hello. BJ: What is your favorite food? BQ: I like pork cutlets. BJ: Ah, I love it too. BQ: Do you prefer filet or loin? BJ: ""Is it fin? What about you?"" BQ: I like roast. BJ: The loin is more reasonable and better, isn't it! BQ: It feels big and like a good deal, doesn't it? BJ: What do you prefer to put on? BQ: ""Definitely sauce."" BJ: ""Sounds good. The royal road."" BQ: What would you like to add? BJ: I also like sauce, but recently I have come to think that salt is delicious too. BQ: You are quite the connoisseur. I prefer to eat grilled meat with salt. BJ: ""That's more sophisticated! This is the first time I've heard of it."" BQ: ""I eat grilled meat with sauce, but salt is also quite good."" BJ: ""I've only ever eaten it with sauce."" BQ: What do you order first at a yakiniku restaurant? BJ: ""It's the tongue."" BQ: I am also Tan. Everyone has an image of asking for something. BJ: Recently, I have been unable to eat things like kalbi as much. BQ: I understand. The fat is heavy, isn't it? I've started ordering chicken often. BJ: ""That's right. Birds are good too. Also, hormone dishes and such."" BQ: I haven't tried hormone (offal) dishes yet. Are they delicious? BJ: I like it! Tastes may vary though. BQ: There are various types of hormone, but which one do you like? BJ: Hatsu, liver, right? BQ: ""It's a classic. I'm getting hungry."""
7,"BJ: Good evening! BQ: Good evening. BJ: Have you eaten dinner? BQ: I ate sushi from the supermarket for dinner. BJ: Is it sushi? That's nice. BQ: It was quite delicious. What did you eat? BJ: I ate a Chinese rice bowl. BQ: Chuka-don sounds good. Is it from a restaurant? BJ: No, it was a ready-made meal. It wasn't very tasty. BQ: That's unfortunate. I feel happy when there's a quail egg on it. BJ: I like quail eggs too. There was a small one on it. BQ: Retort foods come in various kinds, don't they? BJ: Lately, the quality has been high, hasn't it? It's not like it's retort-pouch food, but convenience stores are astonishing. BQ: It's authentic, isn't it? The product development seems impressive. BJ: No, it's true. Do you have a chance to eat it? BQ: ""On my days off, I often depend on you."" BJ: ""It's delicious, isn't it? I like Seven the best."" BQ: I am also devoted to Seven-Eleven. But I wish they would stop using false bottoms. BJ: That's right, and it has gotten really expensive lately. BQ: ""It's become expensive, hasn't it? There are also cases where the quantity decreases but the price stays the same, right?"" BJ: ""There it was, there it was. The thing that surprised me the most was that the fried chicken skewer was 180 yen."" BQ: Was it like that? That's surprising. BJ: I remember thinking it was 100 yen when I was a student. BQ: Coffee has also gradually increased in price, hasn't it? BJ: ""Oh, really? I didn't know that."" BQ: It seems like it went up by about 10 yen. Convenience stores are already quite pricey, so it's tough, isn't it? BJ: Still, there are people who buy it. BQ: I think it's good as long as we can buy it, but I'm worried that we might not be able to keep up with the price increases. BJ: ""Constant price increases are annoying, aren't they?"" BQ: It's true, isn't it? There probably won't be a price reduction for a while."
8,"BJ: Good evening! BQ: Good evening. BJ: What do you want most right now? BQ: ""I'm not sure. Could it be a car?"" BJ: ""Nice car! Is there a specific type you want?"" BQ: ""Anyway, I feel like I want a car. Someday, I would like to drive a sedan."" BJ: If you have a car, it’s convenient for various things. BQ: That's right. Is there a car you would like to drive? BJ: I would like to ride a model called the Beetle Cabriolet someday. BQ: I just looked it up, and it's cool. I'd like to try riding in a convertible. BJ: ""It looks nice, doesn't it? I don't know much about it, but I'd like to try it."" BQ: I'm not knowledgeable at all either, but looking cool is enough, right? BJ: Yes, I still don't understand things like fuel efficiency. BQ: I hear that nowadays, fuel efficiency isn't that bad for any car. BJ: I see, it would be great if you could ride it someday! BQ: I see. I will make it my goal for a while. BJ: I think it's good. BQ: Thank you very much. What do you want the most over there? BJ: Hmm, is it money? BQ: It is the ultimate item that can be used for anything. BJ: Actually, I'm thinking about getting married. BQ: That is wonderful news. You must need all sorts of things, right? BJ: Thank you very much. However, realistically speaking, it's a bit difficult without money. BQ: I see. Are you talking about wedding expenses? BJ: I see, and I also simply think about the cost of living for two people and other things. BQ: Buying a home is a difficult issue, isn't it? I hope the two of you can come to a satisfactory decision. BJ: That's right. Thank you very much. I think people who are married are amazing. BQ: First, I am looking for a partner, but those who are really married are amazing, aren't they? BJ: You will definitely meet a wonderful partner. BQ: Thank you very much. I pray that you two will be happy forever."
9,"BJ: Hello! AU: Hello! BJ: What were you doing this morning? AU: In the morning, I was out taking my daughter to and from cram school. How about you? BJ: You have a daughter! I watched a movie. AU: Movies are nice. What did you watch? BJ: It is a movie called ""Forrest Gump"". AU: I haven't seen it, but it's a famous movie, right? BJ: That's right. I've recently gotten into watching movies that are said to be masterpieces but I haven't seen yet. AU: That's nice. Since we're spending more time at home, we tend to want to watch various things, don't we? BJ: Yes, I originally like movies. Do you watch movies? AU: Since it's summer vacation, the day before yesterday I watched ""Stigmatized Properties"" with my child on Netflix. BJ: Oh, horror, nice! Was it scary? AU: Yes, I watched a horror movie for the first time in a while, and it was quite scary. Movies based on true stories feel even scarier. BJ: ""The horror movie feels very summery and nice. I also recently watched a movie on Netflix called 'Curse'."" AU: ""I haven't seen that yet. Was it interesting?"" BJ: It might be the scariest horror I've seen so far. It might not be suitable for children. AU: That sounds interesting. Could it be a bit too stimulating for children? BJ: ""Is it a surprising kind? Is your child okay with scary things?"" AU: No, it feels like they're clinging to me while saying they're scared, scared. BJ: That's right, you can't see those things when you're little. AU: I'm scared, but I want to watch horror movies. Do you have any other movie recommendations? BJ: Is it in the horror genre? AU: Whether it's horror or not, it's okay. BJ: If you haven't seen it yet, how about the movie ""Orphan""? It's not a horror, but it's scary. AU: Is it a psychological fear? BJ: ""It was so interesting in a human way... I watched it about three times."" AU: Oh, that's something to look forward to! BJ: Sure! I really recommend it. Thank you very much for today! AU: I think I would like to watch it. Thank you very much."
10,"BJ: Hello! AU: Hello! BJ: Is there someone you respect? AU: Is it someone I respect? Not particularly. Do you have someone? BJ: I don't know if you can call it respect, but it's Ichiro, I guess. AU: Ichiro-san, do you also like baseball? BJ: I did it when I was in elementary school. Do you like it? AU: I'm not good at sports and I don't understand baseball at all. Do you also go to watch baseball games? BJ: I see. I don't actually go to watch it in person very often. I only watch the broadcast occasionally. AU: My dad also used to watch baseball broadcasts often at home. So I couldn't watch the TV shows I liked. BJ: Ah, that's a common thing. Do you like watching TV? AU: I don't like it very much, and if anything, I mostly watch videos. BJ: Are you referring to something like YouTube? AU: ""Netflix and YouTube are the main ones. Recently, since it's summer vacation, the kids have pretty much taken over Netflix."" BJ: ""I see. Once you start watching, you can't stop, right?"" AU: That's right, and when it's a series, you just want to keep watching more and more. Do you also watch TV dramas? BJ: ""I like watching dramas on Netflix!"" AU: I love American TV dramas. They have an entertainment value that allows me to watch without thinking about anything. BJ: Do you have any recommendations? AU: ""Do you know the modern version of the old TV drama 'Fuller House'?"" BJ: Oh, I've only heard the name! What kind of story is it? AU: In the past, it was broadcast under the name ""Full House."" It's called a home comedy-drama, right? Are you interested in that kind of thing? BJ: Ah, Full House! I know it, I know it. I like it. I used to watch it a lot when I was a kid. AU: That's it! It was fun back in the day, wasn't it? I loved that. BJ: There's a modern version of that, isn't there? AU: Yes, all the children have completely grown up. It's strange, but I watch while reminiscing about the past. BJ: That sounds interesting. I am watching Korean dramas. AU: People say everyone gets hooked on Korean dramas once they start watching them! Do you have any recommendations? BJ: Lawyer Woo Young-woo is a genius! It's interesting! AU: Is it a series? I will watch it next time."
11,"BJ: Hello! BL: Hello. BJ: Are there any things you are not good at? BL: Are you talking about food? BJ: ""Anything in this world will do."" BL: So, I guess it would be something like cockroaches? BJ: Wow, I'm exactly the same. I can't stand insects. Because of that, I can't eat shrimp. BL: I see. BJ: ""It's gross, isn't it?"" BL: That's right, I've heard that they've been around since ancient times, so it seems unavoidable. BJ: By the way, what kind of food are you not good with? BL: I am not good with raisins. BJ: Are you talking about the appearance? Or the taste? BL: It's the texture. BJ: A lot of people are not good at it, right? BL: I see. There are many people around me who can eat it. BJ: Oh, really? My younger sister also doesn't like them and she used to get scolded for picking out the raisins from raisin bread and throwing them away. BL: ""That bread is really troublesome. And then there's raisin butter."" BJ: ""Oh, I haven't eaten it much. How about rum raisin ice cream?"" BL: I wouldn't choose that either. BJ: ""Well, you can totally live without eating raisins."" BL: That's right. I think it was good that I didn't have many opportunities to eat it. BJ: There are a lot of people who understand, right? Everyone likes the shrimp that I dislike, and I have a hard time explaining it. BL: There were also people who disliked shrimp. The reasons varied though. BJ: Is it true? What is the reason? BL: Because that person said it didn't taste good. BJ: ""That's rare. I actually like the taste, though."" BL: There are various preferences, aren't there? BJ: Yes, the human tongue is mysterious. BL: The mystery of taste, isn't it?"
12,"BJ: Hello! AN: Hello. BJ: ""Are you doing anything with social media?"" AN: ""Wow, I'm just a spectator!"" BJ: Ah, so you do have an account, just in case. AN: It feels like just to see. How about you? BJ: I am doing it just in case, but I mostly just watch. AN: It's the same, isn't it? Are there any people you are following? BJ: I'm here! But recently, I've been feeling like I want to stay away from social media. AN: Why is that again? BJ: I often find myself looking at it even when I don't have any particular reason to. Do you ever feel that way? AN: ""Yes, that's true! Before you know it, an hour has passed."" BJ: That's right! That's what's terrifying! AN: In terms of that, it's not just social media, but smartphones themselves are dangerous. BJ: ""It's something that's easy to become dependent on, right? You're always touching it."" AN: Yes, even during meals I play with it and get scolded by my family. BJ: That might be quite dependent. What are you looking at on your smartphone? AN: I look at stock information, and recently there's also a lot of LINE manga. BJ: ""Manga! You have them. You're into stocks, I'm jealous."" AN: No, the ratio of manga is quite high, I'm embarrassed to say! BJ: ""Manga is abundant too, isn't it? The content is really rich, isn't it?"" AN: ""Yes, and also, it's the one where you can watch another episode after a few hours!"" BJ: Ah, yes, it happens! I also sometimes find myself watching it. It's a clever technique, isn't it? AN: ""It's too good! I'm hooked on that swamp."" BJ: ""Do you play smartphone games?"" AN: That part, not at all. Just played Tetris a long time ago. BJ: Oh, really? Me too. I think it would be bad if I even played games. AN: Online games, you know! Communication-based ones seem hard to quit. BJ: You really need to be careful, or you'll end up touching it 24 hours a day. AN: That is absolutely unacceptable for a working professional!"
