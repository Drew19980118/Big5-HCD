1,"DM: Good evening, nice to meet you. BP: Good evening, nice to meet you. DM: What were you doing today? BP: Today, I did a lot of cleaning in the morning and then relaxed with my child. DM: It's the last day of Obon, isn't it? BP: ""That's right. I also lit the sending fire."" DM: I ended up spending my time lazily without even going back to my hometown. BP: I see. My family gathered on the 13th because my parents' house is in the city. DM: Does it feel like we gathered for the first time in a while? BP: That's right. It's been a while since we got together. Out of the four siblings, three of them came with their kids. DM: That's wonderful. Everyone seems to get along well. BP: Yes, thanks to you, my family and siblings get along well. DM: How old is your child? BP: The children are in 6th grade of elementary school and 9th grade of junior high school. DM: ""You are preparing for an exam, right?"" BP: ""That's right. This summer is hectic."" DM: ""Is your child not showing any signs of being nervous yet?"" BP: Yes, sometimes they say ""I'm nervous!"" but it seems like they haven't really felt it yet. DM: I caused a lot of trouble for my parents during my exam period, haha. BP: Everyone goes through times like that, don't they? I feel like I was also irritable for some reason. DM: I appreciate your understanding. BP: My children also get irritated sometimes. They want to be alone. DM: ""It might be common to want to be alone."" BP: Yes! In a lecture for parents on how to deal with adolescence, we were told that parents just have to be prepared to be completely worn out. DM: So there is such a lecture, huh. Is it held at the school? BP: I received a flyer from the school and attended a lecture hosted by the city. DM: I think it is admirable how much you care for your child. BP: No, no, I went through the same path myself, so I thought I should be prepared. DM: ""I am cheering you on from the shadows. Please do your best without overworking yourself."" BP: Thank you very much! Well then, let's call it a day."
2,"DM: Nice to meet you. Please. BP: Thank you very much! DM: Do you have any hobbies? BP: Recently, I enjoy watching analyses and explanations of dramas on YouTube. DM: ""Is it on YouTube? I didn't know there were such videos!"" BP: That's right. There are many analysis drama series and historical drama series that come up when you search for them. DM: Dramas are quite intricate and difficult, aren't they? BP: That's right. During the previous season, I was watching analysis videos of My Family. DM: Does the investigation enjoy reasoning? BP: I see. In ""My Family,"" there are several suspects and the real culprit, and we were trying to figure out who that is. DM: Did you win? BP: My reasoning was correct! But, I didn't understand the motive for the crime at all. DM: ""That's amazing! Why did you think it was the culprit?"" BP: ""There were actions and words that raised flags along the way, so I thought it might be this person!"" DM: You're sharp, haha. I find it difficult and am not good at it, haha. BP: It might be fun once you start watching. Don't you watch YouTube much? DM: I watch YouTube quite a bit! BP: I see. My children don't watch TV either; they only watch YouTube. DM: Are kids these days like that? BP: It seems so. Nowadays, you can watch it on TV, and each person has their own tablet. DM: I see. Actually, I don't own a TV either. BP: ""Oh, really? It seems like the number of young people like that is increasing these days."" DM: It seems like if I have a TV, I'll end up leaving it on and lazing around, haha. BP: I see. You can also watch TV programs on Tver now. DM: ""I saw it in an advertisement. Was it a service like catch-up streaming?"" BP: Yes, after it's broadcast on TV, you can watch it for free for about a week. DM: It's convenient. I've become interested in recent dramas, so maybe I'll give them a watch. BP: That's right! The drama currently airing, where Mei Nagano-chan rides a unicorn, is interesting. DM: Thank you for the recommendation! I definitely want to check it out. BP: Yes, I'm glad I could be of help. Thank you very much."
3,"DM: Good evening. BP: Good evening. DM: Have you done any shopping recently? BP: Sure, I recently bought a neck cooler and have been using it a lot. DM: What kind of thing is a neck cooler? BP: When you chill it and put it around your neck, it maintains a comfortable cool sensation. It's been quite popular lately. DM: ""Is it something like a towel made from special material?"" BP: It's a material that's said to be used even in space, and what's inside the coolant pack is put into the ring. DM: I learned this for the first time. I would like to experience it. BP: Yes. I was able to buy one for about 1000 yen on Qoo10. DM: ""That's affordable! Is there a limit to how many times it can be used?"" BP: It seems to solidify quickly even in the refrigerator and can be used semi-permanently. However, it is recommended to use it indoors or on the balcony. DM: That's amazing. Does it get warm quickly in hot places? BP: It's okay for about 2 hours, but since it's moderately cool, for outdoor activities, I recommend a cooling towel or a cooling patch. DM: I see. It seems like it could also lead to saving on electricity costs inside the house. BP: When I am home alone, hanging laundry, or unsure about whether to turn on the air conditioner, I often use it. DM: I live alone, but recently the electricity bill has been high, haha. BP: That's right. They said that the price would normally go up by 1000 yen. DM: ""Wow, that much? Going out costs money too, doesn't it?"" BP: That's right. You can go to public facilities like libraries or shopping malls. DM: That's true. I went to the shopping mall today, and it was very crowded. BP: I see! If you use a car, you have to pay for gas, and when you go out, you end up buying something, right? DM: I also give in to temptation and always end up buying unnecessary things, haha. BP: Me too. When I go to the mall, my money just disappears. DM: Since I like books, I often buy one and go home when I stop by a bookstore lol. BP: I also love reading books. Recently, I mainly borrow them from the library and don't purchase them much. DM: The library is convenient, isn't it? However, it's hard to borrow popular books. BP: That's right. You can make a reservation in my hometown, so I reserve such books, but it takes several months before I can borrow them. DM: It feels like you want to read it now, right? BP: Sure. ""I agree. Thank you for the conversation today."""
4,"DM: Good evening. BP: Good evening. DM: Thank you in advance. BP: ""Likewise. Did you have dinner?"" DM: I haven't eaten yet. BP: That must make you hungry. Are you okay? DM: Lunch was a bit late, so somehow I managed to laugh. BP: The other day, we received some zucchini, so our family ate ratatouille. DM: Summer vegetables are great!! BP: That's right. It's full of summer vegetables, so it's great for preventing summer fatigue and colds. DM: Seasonal vegetables really do taste delicious, don't they? BP: It's true, isn't it? Since we have a pressure cooker at home, we can make ratatouille quickly. DM: Is it usually a dish that takes a long time to cook? BP: It's a dish that needs to be simmered, so it can be left alone, but it takes a bit of time. DM: I see. Speaking of seasonal vegetables, I cooked corn rice the other day. BP: That looks delicious! Do you cook it in a regular rice cooker? DM: I see. I bought fresh corn, put it in the rice cooker, and cooked it. BP: I see. I might try making it next time. DM: It seems that putting the core in is the key point! BP: Oh, I thought you just take the fruit and put it in! DM: It seems that the broth comes out. I haven't compared it though. BP: I see. Since the children like corn, I'll give it a try. Thank you for the information! DM: What other summer vegetables are there? BP: Tomatoes, eggplants, okra, and bitter melons, perhaps? DM: I like tomatoes! How do you usually eat them? BP: Just like that, I also put a lot in today's ratatouille. DM: Sounds good. It looks much more delicious than making it with canned tomatoes. BP: That's right. Vegetables are a bit pricey this year, but summer vegetables are delicious so I want to eat a lot of them! DM: Let's be careful of summer fatigue! Thank you! BP: Let's be careful with each other. Thank you very much!"
5,"DM: Good evening, thank you. BP: Thank you in advance! DM: Do you like movies? BP: Yes, although the number of times I go to the movie theater has decreased, I watch them on platforms like Amazon Prime. DM: That's nice. You don't like movie theaters very much, do you? BP: I like it, but I haven't had the chance. The last things I watched were the live-action Aladdin and Frozen 2, and then the final of Kaguya-sama. DM: I also watched Aladdin! It was romantic, wasn't it? BP: It was a bit different from the anime, but it made sense, which was good. The visuals were amazing! DM: I go to the movies pretty often because there is a theater relatively close to me. BP: Sounds good! I'm going to see a movie called Tang, where Ninomiya-kun and a robot go on a journey, at a theater for the first time in a year this summer. DM: ""Isn't it exciting! Ninomiya-kun's acting is really good, isn't it?"" BP: That's right. I was overwhelmed by the drama ""My Family"". I'm looking forward to this movie too! DM: Do you have a favorite actor? BP: Let's see, recently I've been interested in Shun Oguri, who plays the lead role in Taiga dramas. Also, I like Mikako Tabe. DM: Both of you are wonderful. Shun Oguri is incredibly cool. BP: ""That's right. The other day, there were life-sized photos at the Izu Taiga Drama Museum, and I took many pictures."" DM: ""Don't you love it? Whose story is the current Taiga drama about?"" BP: In the story of the Kamakura shogunate, Mr. Oguri plays the role of Yoshitoki, the younger brother of Masako Hojo, who married Minamoto no Yoritomo. DM: I see. The Taiga drama is informative, isn't it? BP: Yes, but since there are many things I don't understand, I also enjoy watching explanation videos on YouTube. DM: I also can't keep up with the story when there are too many characters, lol. BP: This time's historical drama is also about the Kamakura Shogunate and the 13 retainers, so there are many characters, right? DM: That's a must-watch on YouTube. I might not be able to keep up without taking notes, haha. BP: That's right. By the way, among the movies you've seen recently in the theater, which one was the best? DM: ""I'm indecisive, but Kingdom 2 and Jurassic Park were interesting!"" BP: Kingdom, I watched the first one, so I've been curious about it! Was it really grand? DM: I thought, ""Yes, this is a movie that should be seen in a theater. The impact is amazing."" BP: I think I want to watch movies like Kingdom in the theater after all. DM: I watch action movies at the theater and everything else at home. BP: That's right. I also think that human-related work can be done from home. Well then, I'll take my leave for today."
6,"DM: Hello CN: Hello DM: What time did you wake up today? CN: It's around 8 o'clock. DM: From my perspective, you're an early riser! CN: After that, I take a nap, though. DM: I see. If I take a nap, I can't sleep at night. CN: I see. What time did you get up today? DM: It's about 10 o'clock today. CN: Is it always about that much? DM: On weekdays, I get up around 7 o'clock, but on my days off, I end up waking up late. CN: ""The holidays are definitely getting later!"" DM: The weather was bad today, so I didn't feel like getting up. CN: I woke up today because it was garbage day. DM: ""That's great! It's the worst when you forget to take it out, right?"" CN: Since it was raining at night on the day for recyclable garbage, I couldn't put it out the day before. DM: You are very responsible. There are people who nonchalantly put out trash where I live, though. CN: As expected, I feel bad asking them to collect the wet cardboard... DM: ""It's thoughtful and wonderful. I also need to get rid of the accumulating cardboard."" CN: Cardboard tends to accumulate, doesn't it? DM: I tend to put it off because I want to tie it up and dispose of it after it has accumulated to some extent. CN: I understand. It accumulates while you're doing that, doesn't it? DM: I like the task of tying up cardboard boxes. CN: Sounds good. I can't put things together nicely. DM: It feels good to tie it well precisely because it's difficult! CN: Sure! Do you have any tips on how to summarize it well? DM: I feel that it turns out nicely if you tighten it firmly and frequently! CN: I see. I'll try it next time! DM: Thank you very much for talking with me today! CN: Thank you very much!"
7,"DM: Hello CN: Hello DM: What do you like to do on your days off? CN: I read books and catch up on accumulated housework! DM: So, you read books! CN: Yes, that's right! I don't read a lot. DM: Is it about one book per month? CN: I see. It is often about one or two books. DM: Wonderful! I’m struggling because I don’t have the energy to read books. CN: It takes physical strength to read, doesn't it? DM: Are you going to read it for a long time? Little by little? CN: For business books and the like, it's little by little. DM: Does it change depending on the book genre? CN: When it comes to novels, I get curious about what happens next, so I want to read them all at once. DM: I see! It's an interesting story, you can really get absorbed in it, right? CN: I agree! With horror or mystery, it becomes a problem when you don't know the conclusion. DM: Certainly! You do tend to forget who the characters are, don't you? CN: As time passes, you forget. DM: I often spend my holidays watching Netflix. CN: ""Is it a movie or a drama?"" DM: There are many movies and anime! CN: Have you found anything interesting recently? DM: Lately, I've been really enjoying a soccer anime called ""Aoashi""! CN: It seems interesting! DM: You know it! CN: My friend said that the team's story is good. DM: That's right! It's the best in THE boys' manga. CN: It seems like an intense story! DM: If you are interested, please take a look! CN: I'll check it out next time!"
8,"DM: Good evening. HJ: Good evening. DM: Lately, it has become quite cool. HJ: Yes, it is. It's a bit hot today. DM: It is indeed a bit hot during the day, isn't it? HJ: Yes, we still need the fan. DM: Did you spend the summer with a fan? HJ: ""I'm also using the air conditioner! Of course."" DM: Right! I also endured it with an air conditioner and a circulator. HJ: ""Is it a circulator?"" DM: I heard that using them together would reduce the electricity bill, so I introduced them. HJ: I see. How was it actually? DM: Simply put, it's about 1000 yen cheaper compared to last year. HJ: Oh, that sounds good. Is the circulator expensive? DM: ""It was about 3,000 yen for a reasonably priced one from Iris Ohyama."" HJ: ""It's affordable, isn't it? It changes that much?"" DM: It's a strange feeling, isn't it? It seems like the air conditioning efficiency improves somehow. HJ: I see. Is the room spacious? DM: I live alone, and it's about 9 tatami mats. HJ: I see. Even so, it changes that much. DM: I'm surprised myself. It may be because there were days when I didn't need to use the air conditioner. HJ: I see. It's better not to turn the air conditioner on and off too frequently, isn't it? DM: People often say this, don't they? It's like leaving it on for a short outing. HJ: ""Right. I haven't seen this summer's electricity bill yet."" DM: Oh, that's a bit scary! HJ: ""That's scary. I feel like I've used it quite a bit."" DM: Without air conditioning, you get irritated and can't stand it, right? HJ: No doubt about it! When I was at home, I always had it on. DM: I relied entirely on the air conditioner without even opening the window! HJ: ""That's right."""
9,"DM: Hello! HJ: Hello. DM: It's already October, but do you have any memories from this summer? HJ: I went on a trip. DM: Oh! That's nice! Where to? HJ: Shikoku and Ishikawa area, for example. DM: I'm jealous! I've never been there. HJ: Is that so! You don't travel much? DM: I like traveling, but it's always to nearby places. HJ: ""I see. Did you go anywhere this summer?"" DM: ""I went to Atami!"" HJ: Sounds good! Is it the sea? DM: Yes! To the sea and to eat delicious food! HJ: ""Does Atami have any local specialties?"" DM: I bought things like salted fish and dried fish for my friend. HJ: I see. That sounds pretty good. It seems like it would make a good snack to go with alcohol. DM: That's right. I drank too much while I was there. HJ: Hahaha. Did you go to a bar? DM: Yes. I went to a place like a seafood bar. HJ: That's the place! It seems like there are a lot of young people. DM: That's right. There was a lot. The seafood bowl was super delicious. HJ: ""That's right. A seafood bowl sounds good."" DM: And I drank highballs to the point of being drenched. HJ: Oh! Do you like highballs? DM: I like it! But I can't drink it straight. HJ: I like it too. I like things like coke highballs. DM: Sure thing! Here is the translated sentence: ""It's great! The person who thought of that is really smart."" HJ: ""No doubt about it! It's easy to drink, isn't it?"" DM: I tend to drink too much. HJ: I understand."
10,"DM: Hello! HJ: Hello. DM: What do you do on your days off? HJ: Sure. I'll go to the hot springs. DM: Is it nearby?? HJ: ""Yes, there is. A big one."" DM: ""Wow, I'm so jealous."" HJ: There is a waterfall and such. DM: ""That's amazing. That will definitely pass."" HJ: ""That's right. There are also many saunas."" DM: Does it always feel crowded? HJ: ""It's crowded on holidays, isn't it?"" DM: That's right. I also often go to public baths. HJ: I see. Is it nearby? DM: It's within about 1 kilometer! HJ: ""Sounds good! Do you like saunas?"" DM: ""Actually, I've recently gotten hooked."" HJ: ""It's popular lately, isn't it?"" DM: I hear that there's a boom going on. My place is always crowded. HJ: I understand. I have an image of saunas being crowded. DM: ""Is it okay during the COVID-19 pandemic? That's how it feels."" HJ: ""Well, at the point we're already in the same bath..."" DM: It's strange that it doesn't become a cluster. Do you go to the sauna often? HJ: I can enter, but not for a long time. DM: My limit was 10 minutes. HJ: Even 10 minutes is amazing! Maybe around 5 minutes. DM: ""Maybe the temperature in my place is low. Isn't your metabolism good?"" HJ: That might be the case. I get dizzy quickly. DM: It seems that my friend also collapsed from overexertion, so please take care. HJ: ""That's scary! I'll be careful."""
