1,"FR: Hello. CM: Hello! FR: It's been cool recently. CM: It's quite hot here today, but it was cool until yesterday! FR: Certainly! I haven't been outside today, so I don't know. CM: I woke up because of the heat today. FR: Didn't you have the cooler on? CM: I turn it off while I'm sleeping. FR: I see. That sounds better. CM: My room has a window air conditioner, so it's noisy near my ears. FR: What is a window air conditioner? CM: You attach it to the window frame and use it by opening the window that much. FR: I heard it for the first time. CM: I actually want to install it in my room too, but it's expensive. FR: Are the prices different? CM: That's right, the one for windows is cheaper! FR: I see! What about the electricity bill? CM: I'm not sure, I pay the electricity bill together with my family, but I have heard that it costs. FR: I see. Is the sound also loud? CM: Yes, in my case, the window is behind my head, so there is a tremendous noise near my ears. FR: You can't wear that while sleeping. CM: A good night's sleep is more important! FR: Wasn't it hot during the summer? CM: If you properly cool the room before going to bed, it's not that bad in the morning! FR: I see. I leave it on all day. CM: They say turning on the power uses the most electricity, don't they? FR: That's right! The air conditioning is still cheap, but I'm wondering what to do about the heating. CM: The heating is always a stove every year, so I think it will be the same this year. FR: ""Is it an electric heater?"" CM: ""It's oil! Transporting it is difficult!"""
2,"FR: Hello. CM: Hello! FR: Have you decided what to have for dinner? CM: ""I haven't decided, it's my mother's responsibility."" FR: I see. So, what do you feel like eating? CM: It's not homemade, but I really want to eat a McDonald's hamburger! FR: ""Are you moon viewing?"" CM: That's right! Sukiyaki Tsukimi! FR: Have you already eaten? CM: I haven't yet. I'm planning to go eat on Friday! FR: I see. I already ate earlier. CM: After all, you want to try the limited-time offer, right? FR: I understand. It seems that other shops also have moon-viewing items. CM: Personally, I'm interested in Komeda Coffee! FR: What was it like? CM: It was a Tsukimi burger about twice the size of a McDonald's one! I don't think I can finish it. FR: That is huge. It looks like it will make me full. CM: Moreover, depending on the time of day, it seems that the bread might be brought out before the items you ordered. FR: As expected of Komeda Coffee. CM: People often talk about reverse photo fraud, don't they? FR: You said it. It's rare in this day and age. CM: Instead, it seems that the moon-viewing item at Komeda is about twice the price of McDonald's! FR: ""It really does have a proper price!"" CM: ""Yes, but it looks delicious and I want to try it!"" FR: I would like to try it at least once! It seems like if I eat that, I wouldn't need anything else for the whole day. CM: It seems that anything left over, except for things using eggs, can usually be taken home, so that's a relief, I guess? FR: You can do that too! Komeda is amazing! CM: I want to try eating Shiro Noir once! FR: What kind of thing is that? CM: Is there soft-serve ice cream on the warm Danish pastry? It looked delicious!"
3,"FR: Hello. CM: Hello! FR: Did you do anything summery this summer? CM: I feel like I didn't really do anything in particular, but I did go to the summer festival in the game! FR: Is it a summer festival in the game?! CM: That's right! Volunteers are creating the venue for us! FR: That's amazing. What kind of game is it? CM: The online game I'm playing is called FINAL FANTASY XIV! FR: ""I've heard of it. Is it an MMORPG?"" CM: That's right, that's right! FR: If I had to say, I've mostly only played FPS games and haven't really done those kinds of things. CM: I don't usually play FPS because they make me dizzy, but I bought Splatoon 3! FR: I bought it too. It's fun, isn't it? CM: This is my first time playing Splatoon, so I can't win at all, but painting is fun! FR: I understand. I can't defeat the enemy either, so I just keep painting. CM: When I go to the front lines, I get taken out immediately, so I'm always nervously painting at the back. FR: Isn't gyro operation too difficult? CM: It's difficult! Especially for me since I'm using Lite! FR: ""Does that mean it's not a controller?"" CM: I placed the Lite on the desk and played with the controller, but at first it was really difficult because I was tilting the device! FR: I see. If you do it with the main unit, it seems like you'll get really muscular. CM: Your body is likely to become stiff. FR: My hands hurt even when using the controller. CM: Doing it while tilting my wrist is really hard! FR: How did you get into Final Fantasy? CM: I got completely hooked after my friend invited me to start! FR: Is it that you are now more addicted than your friend? CM: Yes, I ended up alone. FR: I often experience that too. CM: ""I ended up celebrating the 9th anniversary of playing alone."""
4,"FR: Hello. CM: Hello! FR: Do you watch YouTube? CM: I watch something every day! FR: What have you seen recently? CM: I watched a food terror channel called Lilo's Solo Play Channel! FR: ""Is this a food terror!"" CM: I'm usually eating really greasy food with highballs or sake. FR: Is that at home? CM: The house is about 90%, and the outdoors is about 10%. FR: I see. I haven't seen anything like that, but it sounds interesting. CM: Since he is a hunter, he sometimes eats meals in the mountains! FR: ""Um, maybe it's deer?"" CM: I think there was also a time when a deer was butchered, but I was too scared to watch it. FR: ""You're an incredible person. But you wouldn't drink alcohol in the mountains, would you?"" CM: Yes, it's coffee outdoors! FR: Great. Do you like drinking alcohol? CM: I can't drink alcohol because I'm allergic. FR: Is that so? CM: Yes, I’m okay with disinfection and such, but when I drink, my airways tighten up. FR: That's not good. CM: So, I'm thinking it would be nice to watch that person's video to learn the proper way to drink alcohol! FR: Do you eat while watching? CM: No, it's usually updated around the time I finish dinner, so I check it right away so I don't get hungry! FR: Certainly. You can't watch it when you're hungry, can you? CM: Generally, it looks like extremely unhealthy food, so it's questionable whether it will whet my appetite, but just in case! FR: The unhealthy ones are the tasty ones, right? CM: I used to put frozen fried rice into cup yakisoba and eat it! FR: ""It exceeded my expectations. It looks delicious, though."" CM: It's more than enough for two people."
5,"FR: Hello. CM: Hello! FR: ""Do you have any recent trends in your life?"" CM: ""Recently? I wonder what. Maybe eating miso soup as a late-night snack."" FR: Miso soup seems to be good for your health as a late-night snack. CM: I also drink a tea called Eucommia tea every day! FR: What kind of thing is that? CM: It seems that it can help with swelling and also has diet effects! FR: When is the best time to take it? CM: I usually drink when I'm hungry! FR: Sounds good. I only drink barley tea. CM: Barley tea is delicious too, right? I like it hot as well! FR: ""It's the ice-cold one, right? I also drink tea in the morning."" CM: ""I also like tea, lately I've been preferring unsweetened drinks."" FR: Is it something like coffee? CM: I can now drink black coffee this year too! FR: ""That's a good thing. Do you often drink it by itself?"" CM: That's right, sometimes I drink it with something sweet, but usually I drink it on its own. FR: ""Sweets go well with it, don't they? I don't drink it very often, though."" CM: I think my taste buds have matured because I can now drink bitter or unsweetened things. FR: ""There are times like that, right? I couldn't even eat wasabi in the past."" CM: Can you eat now? FR: I would rather not have it. CM: Recently, there was an article in the news about people moving away from wasabi! I would also be in trouble without it. FR: ""I see. Chili oil falls into that category as well."" CM: I like to add just a bit of chili oil! FR: I'm just a bit too. When it's too much, that's all I can taste. CM: ""I recently realized that it's also delicious when dripped into somen noodle soup."" FR: I have never done that. I'll give it a try. CM: By all means! I highly recommend it!"
6,"FR: Hello. EO: Hello! FR: Did you eat dinner? EO: It's right now! FR: What are you going to eat? EO: It's a pot! FR: What kind of hot pot is it? EO: I chose sesame soy milk. FR: It looks delicious. EO: I like it. FR: ""Would you like to add something at the end?"" EO: There is a lot of ramen! FR: If it's soy milk, pasta is also recommended. EO: Oh, that looks delicious. FR: It looks like carbonara. EO: ""Shall I add cheese?"" FR: Cheese, and also eggs, I guess. EO: That's nice! FR: The best part of a hot pot is the final dish, right? EO: Certainly! Do you have a favorite type of hot pot? FR: I like kimchi. EO: Oh, do you like spicy food? FR: Don't you think kimchi hotpot is not that spicy? EO: ""Isn't it spicy?!"" FR: It's a little less spicy than kimchi. EO: ""Wow, really! I'm not good with spicy food."" FR: Are you also not good with the spiciness of kimchi? EO: The spiciness of kimchi is manageable! FR: Then, I can probably go! EO: I'll try it next time!"
7,"FR: Good evening. EO: Good evening! FR: It's been getting cooler recently, hasn't it? EO: The mornings and evenings are comfortable. FR: Is the air conditioner on? EO: Actually, I'm still wearing it... FR: ""You tend to turn it on, right? Me too. I think it's about time to turn it off."" EO: ""When I turn it off, it's hot because there's no wind. So I end up turning it on again."" FR: Don't you have a fan or something? EO: ""The fan is being used in another room."" FR: I see. That sounds hot. EO: That's right. I hope it gets cooler soon. FR: Got it. Do you like autumn? EO: I like autumn and spring. FR: Could it be hay fever? EO: ""It is not."" FR: Jealous. I don't like pollen in spring. EO: You have hay fever, don't you? FR: That's right. But it's been better recently. EO: Oh, really? FR: Is it thanks to wearing masks? EO: Ah, I see! FR: I hope it will get better like this. EO: Sure! Are you taking any medicine? FR: I drink the commercial ones. EO: ""Are the symptoms rather severe?"" FR: ""It's a little severe, isn't it? The spray you use inside your nose works well."" EO: ""Something like that exists, huh!"" FR: Yes! It also clears up nasal congestion, so it's the best. EO: We should be grateful to the person who invented it."
8,"FR: Hello. EO: Hello! FR: What is your hobby? EO: Reading! FR: What kind of books have you read recently? EO: I'm rereading a long fantasy novel right now. FR: I see. Do you have that? EO: That's right! FR: That sounds good. Do you have a lot of books? EO: ""I sell everything except my favorites."" FR: ""They take up space, don't they?"" EO: That's right. That's the problem. FR: How much do you have now? EO: About 100 books? FR: Amazing! EO: ""That's not true. Do you read books?"" FR: I used to read it before, but not much recently. EO: ""Is it just games?"" FR: And then I read manga, too. EO: Oh, I read manga too. FR: Recently, I have been really into One Piece. EO: Timely, isn't it? The movie is playing now. FR: What kind of manga do you read? EO: I also have a lot of Jump series. FR: ""Was Spy x Family also in Jump?"" EO: That's right! With an app called Jump Plus. FR: Lately, it's great that you can read various things on apps! EO: Hey! For free! I'm grateful. FR: It's amazing that you can read for free. You don't even need to browse in the store. EO: Certainly! Nowadays, you can't even browse books in stores, right?"
9,"FR: Hello. FV: Hello. I look forward to working with you today. FR: Did you have breakfast? FV: I mainly ate vegetables, and also had a banana and yogurt. FR: Do you eat it every day? FV: Yes, it's like that every day. FR: You're healthy. Do you ever eat rice or bread in the morning? FV: Yes, I once had a bit of a health issue before, so I am careful about my health. I eat both bread and rice. FR: I see. If you were told to choose between bread or rice, which one would you choose? FV: If I had to choose, I prefer rice. How about you, <FR>? FR: It's mealtime! FV: The bread is also delicious, but as a Japanese person, it inevitably ends up like that. FR: Sure. Here is the translation:

""Yes, I often eat rice and natto."" FV: Natto is great, it’s made from soybeans and is a fermented food, so it’s healthy! FR: ""It's healthy, isn't it? Do you often eat natto?"" FV: Yes, I like crushed natto! FR: What exactly is ""hikiwari""? FV: I don't know the exact definition, but it's the one where the beans are split and become grainy. FR: I see. I might not have eaten it much. FV: Sometimes at the supermarket, you'll see something labeled ""hikiwari,"" so please try it once. FR: Yes. I currently have shiso natto at home. FV: Plum shiso is nice, I love plums. FR: Would you like to eat pickled plums as well? FV: Yes, we have it shipped from Wakayama! FR: ""It's authentic! Is it really different?"" FV: As expected, it feels like there's a special touch, and it's quite different. I'm only concerned about the salt content. FR: Oh, I see. Certainly, I'm concerned about the sodium content. FV: The recommended daily intake of salt is 6 grams, so I can only eat it occasionally. FR: I see. By the way, how many grams is one pickled plum approximately? FV: I don't know for sure!"
10,"FR: Hello. FV: Hello. FR: Did you do anything summery this summer? FV: When it comes to summery activities, I guess barbecuing is about it. FR: Barbecues are fun, aren't they! I did it too. FV: Somehow, just grilling meat outdoors changes the mood, doesn't it? FR: I see. Where did it happen? FV: This is the yard of the house. FR: Is it spacious? FV: It's not that much, but we can at least have a BBQ. FR: I'm envious. It's impossible because where I live is not a detached house. FV: In the city and such, you hardly ever find gardens, right? FR: There aren't any. So, you have to go to parks or such facilities to do it. FV: ""Isn't the park's rules getting quite strict recently?"" FR: That's right. There are paid barbecue zones available. FV: ""It costs money. I'm shocked."" FR: If it's not there, sometimes you can't use the faucet water. FV: Of course, you do all the cleaning up yourselves too, right? FR: Of course. But we also have set rentals. FV: I see, that reduces the cost. FR: That's right. But renting also costs quite a bit. FV: Everything costs money, doesn't it? FR: That's right. So, I'm envious that you can do it at home. FV: Indoor activities are better in the city, but outdoor activities might be more convenient in the countryside. FR: Do you do anything else in the garden? FV: I'm not sure if you would call it a garden, but I'm doing some home gardening. FR: That's amazing. What kind of things are you making? FV: It is still early, but there are things like perilla leaves, lily flowers, and myoga. FR: I see. It looks like it could be used as a topping for dishes. FV: Sure, when there's not enough, I feel like I can just go pick some from the garden."
